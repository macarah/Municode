The failure to produce such person within 30 days after being requested to do so may result in denial of the application.

Each applicant shall certify in writing that the applicant has read this article and, if the license is granted, each licensee shall maintain an updated copy of this article on the premises.

Once an application, accompanying documents, and the required investigative and license fees are filed with the city police department, the police department office shall conduct a criminal investigation of the applicant and prepare a written criminal investigation report detailing all information relating to fingerprinting, criminal history, arrest data, and other matters pertinent to law enforcement. Upon completion of the criminal investigation report, the police department's office shall assemble the tendered application forms and accompanying documents relating to investigation and processing of the application and deliver such documents to the city clerk. If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant meets the requirements set by this article and all other requirements of this article are satisfied, then the city clerk shall schedule the application for hearing at the next regularly scheduled public hearing calendar before the city council and shall so inform the applicant of this fact before such meeting. If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this article, or if the applicant fails to meet all other requirements outlined by this article, then the city clerk shall inform the applicant, in writing, that the application has been denied, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his right to appeal. Such appeal shall be before the city council in accordance with this article. If an applicant desires to appeal a denial, the applicant must file a written request for an appeal with the city clerk within five business days of the date of the written notice informing the applicant of the denial.
(i)
Any application that the city clerk determines to satisfy all the requirements outlined in this article, including character requirements as contained in the criminal investigation report of the police department, shall be scheduled for review at the next regularly scheduled public hearing of the city council. At that meeting, the applicant and any person opposed to such application has the right to present to the city council any information that the city council determines is relevant to the licensing decision. In making its determination on whether to approve or deny the application, the city council shall look to the qualifications set forth in this article and consider the public interest and welfare of the citizens of the city. The board shall have the discretion to grant or deny the application based on the information presented. A decision by the city council shall be made within 30 days from the date of the public hearing, unless the decision is postponed for purposes of obtaining additional information deemed necessary for consideration of the application. Notice of the decision by the city council shall be mailed to the applicant. If the application is denied, such written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his right to appeal. Such appeal shall be taken solely in accord once with this article.
(j)
In all instances in which an application is denied, the applicant may not reapply for the same type of license for at least one year from the date of denial.
(k)
Upon the issuance of a license, the licensee must have and continuously maintain in city a registered agent upon whom any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law or under this article may be served. This person must be an individual and must be a resident of the city. The licensee shall submit the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, to the city clerk. The identity of the agent may also be submitted contemporaneous to filing the license application.
(l)
Upon approval by the city council of the application for a license, the city clerk shall issue a license in accordance with the approved application. If the applicant is an individual, the license shall be issued in the name of the individual. If the application is a corporation, the license shall be issued in the name of the corporation and in the name of the majority stockholder or a principal officer of the corporation. If the application is a partnership, the license shall be issued in the name of the partnership and in the name of one of the partners.

(1)
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
(2)
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
(3)
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
(c)
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

1,000 feet from any parcel occupied by another sexually oriented business or by any establishment licensed by the state to sell alcohol at the premises; and

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ordinances of the city, a nonconforming sexually oriented business, lawfully existing in all respects under law prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, may continue to operate for two years following that date in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in its current location.
