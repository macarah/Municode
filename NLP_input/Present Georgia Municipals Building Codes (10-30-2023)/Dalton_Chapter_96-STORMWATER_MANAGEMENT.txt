ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 96-1. - Scope of responsibility for the city drainage system.
The city drainage system consists of all streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the City of Dalton which control and/or convey stormwater through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance, and improvements to those segments of this system which (1) are located within public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; (2) are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operations, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or (3) are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operations, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City of Dalton and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operations, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America.
(a)
The City of Dalton may accept temporary or permanent easements for public dedication of such drainage systems and facilities for operations, maintenance, and/or improvement if one or more of the following criteria are met:
(1)
The drainage system is connected directly to the city's existing public drainage system and conveys stormwater runoff from a city property or city right-of-way.
(2)
A significant amount of stormwater runoff conveyed by the drainage system is generated by city owned property or city right-of-way.
(3)
Failure of the drainage system will result in a significant threat to the public and/or adjacent property.
(b)
The City of Dalton may accept drainage systems for operations, maintenance, and/or improvement determined to meet the eligibility criteria listed in (a) if:
(1)
The drainage system has not been damaged due to negligence, neglect or intentional act of the property owner.
(2)
Easements with adequate access for operations, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities are provided by the property owner to the city.
(c)
The City of Dalton will not accept drainage systems for the purposes of operations, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities if one or more of the following criteria are met:
(1)
The drainage system is located on a non-residential property such as but not limited to commercial, industrial, institutional or multi-family properties (such as commercial apartment complexes). However, the city may accept an easement for such drainage systems if the existing condition of the system or facility poses a significant and real threat to human health and safety of the general public (including city infrastructure) and meets the criteria outlined in (a) and (b) above.
(2)
The drainage system is located under an existing building(s).
(d)
Prior to acceptance of a drainage easement for an existing drainage system or facility, the public works director will prepare and provide to the city council a corrective action plan to address known deficiencies with the drainage system or facility. Following acceptance of the easement, the corrective action plan will be included in the city's list of known capital improvement and maintenance projects. The acceptance of the drainage system or facility shall not create a special duty on the city to prioritize the corrective action plan above other known capital improvement and maintenance projects.

Sec. 96-4. - Stormwater fee.
The mayor and council find that the stormwater system of the city is necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and residents of the city. The provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively maintain and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater operating, maintenance and capital investment needs. The mayor and council find that such funding can be achieved in part by the charge of a stormwater fee to property owners, citizens, and residents of the city. The public works committee of the city is authorized to determine the fee or fees to be charged and to provide for the imposition and collection of the fee.

Sec. 96-9. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre- development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point source pollution, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(3)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(4)
Encourage the use of non structural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable;
(5)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and
(6)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved active projects and long-term follow up.
(b)
Applicability. All persons proposing development and/or construction within the city shall submit a stormwater management plan and hydrology study to the engineer for review of conformity with this article, except as provided in section 96-11.

Sec. 96-14. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria.
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter:
(a)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. Stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(1)
The system is designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on site to the maximum extent practicable. The determination by the engineer that it is infeasible to apply the stormwater runoff quality/reduction standard, on part or all of a project, must be documented with the site plan review documents. If the first 1.0 inch of rainfall can be retained onsite using runoff reduction methods, then no additional water quality treatment is required. If the 1.0 inch cannot be retained onsite, the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the LDM and GSMM;
(2)
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained in accordance with the specific criteria in the LDM; and
(3)
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified in the LDM are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(b)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
(1)
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
(2)
24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; and
(3)
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
All design and construction work that is undertaken proximate to stream channels (including the buffer areas) shall be in strict conformance with current local, state and federal regulations.
(c)
Flood protection. Flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying storm events such that flooding is not exacerbated for the storm events specified in the LDM and in accordance with the applicable requirements of this article.
(d)
Drainage system guidelines. A system emphasizing a natural as opposed to an engineered drainage strategy shall be encouraged. The applicability of a natural approach depends upon such factors as site storage capacity, open channel hydraulic capacity, maintenance needs/resources and regulatory permitting factors. Stormwater conveyance facilities may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters and shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public and private properties adjoining project sites. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry stormwater runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the LDM;
(2)
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the LDM; and
(3)
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the LDM.
(Ord. No. 14-09, § 1, 12-1-2014; Ord. No. 20-22, § 7, 1-19-2021)
Sec. 96-15. - Maintenance of facilities.
(a)
Stormwater detention facilities which are deemed to be an essential and integral part of the municipal stormwater management program may be maintained by the city. Stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by state or federal law. Stormwater management facilities which are built to satisfy this article for non-residential developments, and function for only one owner of a parcel of land in fee simple, will not be maintained by the city, and the owner thereof shall meet the requirements of the subsequent provisions of this article. No stormwater detention facility shall be accepted for maintenance by city without first being approved by the mayor and council.
In order to facilitate the maintenance of said stormwater detention facilities, a drainage easement shall be provided which will at a minimum encompass the 100-year flood elevation contour plus ten feet. The ten feet shall be measured horizontally outward from the 100-year flood elevation contour. A 20-foot access easement shall be provided from an existing or proposed right-of-way to the said stormwater detention facility. The access easement shall be improved so as to allow for periodic usage for the purpose of maintenance of the stormwater management facility.
(b)
An inspection and maintenance agreement shall be executed for all private on-site stormwater management facilities prior to approval of the final plat or issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. Such agreement shall be in form and content acceptable to the engineer, and shall provide that all inspection, maintenance and repair procedures of such facilities shall be the responsibility of the property owner. Such agreement shall provide for access to the facility by virtue of a non-exclusive perpetual easement in favor of the city at reasonable times for regular inspection by the engineer.
(1)
The agreement shall provide that preventive maintenance inspections of infiltration systems, retention, or detention structures may be made by the engineer, at his option. Such inspection schedule shall be established on a frequency that meets the intent of this article and applicable regulatory compliance requirements.
(2)
The agreement shall provide that if, after an inspection, the condition of a facility presents an immediate danger to the public health, safety or general welfare because of unsafe conditions or improper maintenance, the city shall have the right, but not the duty, to take such action as may be necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare and adjacent properties from damage. If it is determined that such deficient conditions are the result of neglected maintenance, or other action caused by the property owner, then any cost incurred by the city shall be paid by the property owner as set forth in subsection (b)(4) below.
(3)
The maintenance agreement shall be recorded by the property owner in the land records of Whitfield County prior to approval of the final plat or issuance of a final certificate of occupancy.
(4)
The agreement shall provide that the engineer shall notify the property owner(s) of the facility of any violation, deficiency or failure to comply with this article. The agreement shall also provide that upon a failure to correct violations requiring maintenance work, within 30 days after notice thereof, the city may provide for all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. The owner(s) of the facility shall be assessed the costs of the work performed by the city pursuant to this subsection and subsection (b)(2) above, and there shall be a lien on all property of the owner in which said property utilizes, or will utilize such facility in achieving stormwater management, which lien, when filed in the county real estate records, shall have the same status and priority as liens for non-payment of ad-valorem taxes.
