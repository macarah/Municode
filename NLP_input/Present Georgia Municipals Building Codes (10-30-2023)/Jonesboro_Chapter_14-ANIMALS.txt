ARTICLE III. - POULTRY

Sec. 14-51. - Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to authorize and to provide standards for the keeping of poultry in the rear or side yard of a single-family detached residence. It is intended to enable residents to keep poultry on a non-commercial basis, while limiting the potentially adverse impacts on surrounding neighbors.
(1)
Number of poultry allowed. The maximum number of poultry allowed is 25 birds per single-family detached residence located in any residential zoning district. For the purposes of this article, "poultry" shall mean any domesticated bird, including but not limited to, chickens (including roosters), ducks, geese, guineas, quail, pigeons and turkeys.
(2)
Housing types allowed to keep poultry; adult residents deemed keepers or owners. Only those residing in single-family detached residences may keep poultry as authorized in this chapter. Each adult residing at any single-family detached residence at which poultry are kept shall be deemed a keeper or owner of the poultry.
(3)
Personal use only. The keeping of poultry pursuant to this chapter is for non-commercial, personal use only.
(4)
Poultry enclosed. Each keeper of poultry is required to have an accessory structure and/or fenced area to house and control said poultry. Such accessory structures shall meet all requirements for accessory structures set out in the zoning ordinance, including those for setbacks and location. Poultry shall be kept only in the rear or side yard and must be within a fenced area. No poultry shall roam free.
(5)
Nuisance prohibited. The keeping of poultry authorized under this chapter shall not create a nuisance as defined by the Jonesboro City Code. The keeping of poultry shall be conducted in a manner that does not disturb the use or enjoyment of adjacent properties. Odor generated shall not be perceptible at the property boundaries, and noise generated shall not disturb people of reasonable sensitivity at the property boundaries. Only motion-activated lighting shall be used to light any fenced area.
