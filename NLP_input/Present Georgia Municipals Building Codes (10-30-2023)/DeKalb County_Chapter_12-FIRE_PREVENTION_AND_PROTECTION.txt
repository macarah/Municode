ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 12-1. - Purpose.
This chapter is an exercise of the police powers of DeKalb County, Georgia for the preservation and protection of the public health, peace, safety and welfare, and all the provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed for that purpose. The governing authority determines that there is also a need, in its adoption of the state minimum standard codes, to adopt certain amendments thereto. Local public safety conditions in the areas to which this chapter applies require amendments to the state minimum standard codes which are not less stringent than the state minimum standard code for the protection of life and property.
