ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

Sec. 11-1. - Statutory authorization.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Brunswick, Georgia, does ordain as follows:
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-1), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017)
Sec. 11-2. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of Brunswick, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-2), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017)
Sec. 11-3. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(a)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(b)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(c)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and
(d)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(e)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-3), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017)
Sec. 11-4. - Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
(a)
To protect human life and health;
(b)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(c)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(d)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(e)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(f)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and;
(g)
To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall, shall be considered "new construction".
Appeal means a request for a review of the administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 11-6.
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year.
Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub grade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage.
Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include:
(a)
Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials.
(b)
Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events.
(c)
Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines.
(d)
Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines.
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and permanent storage of materials or equipment.
Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event.
Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before March 6, 1974.
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 6, 1974.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
(a)
The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
(b)
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A.
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community.

Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding.
Floodplain administrator means the city engineer or such other person as the city manager may designate in writing from time to time.
Flood-proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, blockage of bridge and culvert openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.
Historic structure means any structure that is:
(a)
Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;
(b)
Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or
2.
Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
LiMWA means the limit of moderate wave action and represents the approximate landward limit of the 1.5-foot breaking wave. The effects of wave hazards between the VE zone and the LiMWA (or between the shoreline and the LiMWA for areas where VE zones are not identified) will be similar to, but less severe than those in the VE zone. The LiMWA also determines the landward limit of the coastal A zone (CAZ).
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code.
Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a communities' Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced after March 6, 1974 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure.
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 6, 1974.
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is:
(a)
Built on a single chassis;
(b)
400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
(c)
Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
(d)
Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(a)
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
(b)
Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
V zone certificate means that the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations require coastal communities to ensure that buildings built in V zones are anchored to resist wind and water loads acting simultaneously. Buildings in V zones are subject to a greater hazard than buildings in other types of floodplains. Not only do they have to be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE), they must be protected from the impact of waves, hurricane-force winds, and erosion. A registered professional engineer or architect must certify that the design and planned methods of construction meet NFIP requirements. The community must maintain a copy of this certification in the permit file for all structures built or substantially improved in the V zone. If breakaway walls are used to enclose areas below the building that exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square feet, those walls must also be certified by the registered professional engineer or architect.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION

Sec. 11-51. - General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(a)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
(b)
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
(c)
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
(d)
Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. (Not applicable in coastal high hazard areas).
(1)
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
i.
Provide a minimum of two openings on opposing walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
ii.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and,
iii.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions.
(2)
So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area.
(3)
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
(4)
The building permit applicant (owner or agent) must sign a "Non-conversion agreement for certain structures in the floodplain," a document provided by the floodplain administrator. The non-conversion agreement provides the right to the floodplain administrator to inspect the enclosed area at any time. The document will be recorded and kept with the building file. This agreement will apply to all floor levels below the BFE that are protected by flood vents.
(e)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
(f)
Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces.
(g)
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
(h)
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
(i)
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(j)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

Sec. 11-52. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 11-51(d), "elevated buildings".
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Wood framed construction shall not be allowed as a structure's foundation system below the BFE plus one foot. FEMA approved types 4 and 5 flood resistant materials are allowed within the freeboard zone. CMU type exterior walls used in garages shall be erected to the BFE plus one foot.
(2)
Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify, using the latest version of the Flood-Proofing Certificate, FEMA form 086-0-34, that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 11-33(f).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an either existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that:
(i)
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or
(ii)
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 48 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. subsection 11-51(f) above).
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
(i)
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days.
(ii)
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or
(iii)
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a. and c., above.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-6, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.
Only if subsection (4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.
(5)
Areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations and without designated floodways: For properties located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-6, where streams exist and base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (zones AE), the following provisions apply:
a.
No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements, shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principals.
b.
New construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 11-6.
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-17), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017)

Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-6, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
(a)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 11-6, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (b) and (c) shall apply:
(b)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(c)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 11-51(d), "Elevated buildings".
(d)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
(e)
The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(f)
For subdivisions and developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 11-32(a)(3) and (b).
(d)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-19), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017)
Sec. 11-55. - Coastal high hazard areas (V-zones and Coastal A (LiMWA)).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-6, are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V-zones and Coastal A (LiMWA)). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge, therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(a)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be located a minimum of 25 feet landward of the reach of mean high tide.
(b)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (f) below.
(c)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or shear walls.
(d)
Wood framed construction shall not be allowed as a structure's foundation system below the BFE plus one foot.
(e)
All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the Standard Building Code.
(f)
A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify, using a V zone certificate and elevation certificate, which the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in subsections (i), (j) and (k) herein.
(g)
All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed:
1.
No solid walls shall be allowed.
2.
Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only.
3.
If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises.
4.
The enclosure must not exceed 299 square feet.
(h)
Prior to construction, plans for any structures having latticework or decorative screening must be submitted to the administrator for approval.
(i)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section.
(j)
There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered:
1.
Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction;
2.
Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and
3.
Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping.
(k)
There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage.
(l)
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of this section are met.
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-20), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017)
Sec. 11-56. - Standards for subdivisions.
(a)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(b)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(c)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and;
(d)
For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES

Sec. 11-71. - Variances.
(a)
The city commission shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter.
(b)
The city commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city commission may appeal such decision to the appropriate court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the city commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause,
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and;
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the administrator may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
