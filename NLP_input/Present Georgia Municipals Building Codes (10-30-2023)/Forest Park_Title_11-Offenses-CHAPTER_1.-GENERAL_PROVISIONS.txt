Camp;
(k)
Other evidence presented at various hearings and meetings of the mayor and city council relating to adverse secondary effects of adult entertainments that allow public nudity, which has been recorded and incorporated into the record of proceedings of the City of Forest Park, including past meetings of the governing body.
Based upon all of this evidence, the City of Forest Park Governing Body finds:
(1)
Allowing nudity in public places can result in ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities leading to a deleterious effect on the community as a whole. Public nudity can cause an increase in criminal behavior in the vicinity of the same, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use, assaults and batteries, and corruption of public officials.
(2)
Allowing nudity in public areas of the city may result in an exacerbation of urban blight, lower property values, lowering of community values, decreased general health, morals, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the city, and concerns for those under the age of eighteen (18) years of age.
(3)
The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) and (2) above raise substantial governmental concerns.
(4)
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities as described above, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Forest Park, Georgia; and based on the documentary and oral evidence presented at the public hearings before the mayor and city council (hereinafter "the governing body") held prior to the adoption of this section and in particular on July 21, 2009 as well as the public hearing held before the governing body on March 9, 2010, and other public hearings before the governing body; and based on the evidence and statements of persons who have appeared before members of the governing body on other occasions, and on other documentary evidence submitted to the governing body, the governing body for the City of Forest Park, Georgia takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to public nudity, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the specific finding of the governing body that public nudity under certain circumstances begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions.
Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities allowing public nudity are criminal activity, depression of property values, acceleration of community blight, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, lowered health, safety, welfare, and morals of citizens, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove referenced. The governing body finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the City of Forest Park, Georgia, as well unless public nudity is prohibited.
The governing body therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the city, the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent the adverse impacts of public nudity by regulating and prohibiting public nudity within the city as provided in this section. Therefore, the governing body of the city finds that the regulation and prohibition of public nudity as provided herein will promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions. The governing body further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To all of these ends, this section is hereby adopted.
