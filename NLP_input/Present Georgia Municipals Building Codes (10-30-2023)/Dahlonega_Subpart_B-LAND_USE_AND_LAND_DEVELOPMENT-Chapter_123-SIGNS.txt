Chapter 123 - SIGNS

Sec. 123-1. - Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Sign Ordinance of the City of Dahlonega."
( Ord. No. 2008-04 Amended, art. 1, 9-17-2015 )
Sec. 123-2. - Purpose and scope.
(a)
The mayor and city council find that adoption of sign regulations serves the following purposes:
(1)
The public health, safety and general welfare of the city is enhanced by ensuring the prohibition and removal of dangerous and unsafe signs.
(2)
Pedestrian and motorist safety is promoted by reducing and limiting the number and area of signs, which can unduly distract motorists and pedestrians, create traffic hazards, confuse motorists when such signs are similar to traffic signs, and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public.
(3)
This chapter is intended to promote attractive signs which clearly present the visual message in a manner that is compatible with its surroundings. The appearance, character and quality of the city are affected by the location, size, construction and graphic design of its signs.
(4)
The mayor and council find that development in the B-3, historical business zoning district, and CBD, the central business zoning district, is unique from other areas of the city due to its history, architecture, cultural heritage and integrity; its substantial contribution to the economic vitality of the city; the compactness of buildings and businesses in the districts; the geometry of public road intersections; and the special mixture of pedestrian and slower speed vehicular traffic.
(5)
The economic well-being of the city is enhanced by allowing individual businesses to identify themselves and the goods and services offered in a clear and distinctive manner, by creating a more attractive district to tourists, and by preserving and improving the appearance of the historic downtown and surrounding area, thereby ensuring that signs are properly integrated with and harmonious to the buildings and sites in the historic downtown.
(6)
The purpose of the city's elimination of mobile signs and billboards is to promote the safe movement of vehicular traffic, to reduce vehicular traffic, to reduce air pollution, and to improve the aesthetic appearance of the city.
(b)
By enacting this chapter, the city intends:
(1)
To balance the rights of individuals, businesses, and government to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
To afford the business community equal and fair opportunity to advertise and promote its products and services without discrimination;
(3)
To preserve and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city;
(4)
To improve traffic and pedestrian safety;
(5)
To maintain and enhance the visual environment, and preserve the right of citizens and visitors to enjoy the city's scenic beauty;
(6)
To protect property values of nearby public and private property by minimizing possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
To avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(8)
To promote economic development;
(9)
To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; and
(10)
To promote the purposes stated in this chapter by regulating signs based on objective standards, including, but not limited to, height and size, and without regard to the content of the sign message.
(c)
This chapter is adopted under the authority of the city in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the zoning ordinance. This chapter is adopted and hereafter amended pursuant to article IX, section II, paragraph IV of the constitution of the State of Georgia and the Georgia Planning Act of 1989.
( Ord. No. 2008-04 Amended, art. 1, 9-17-2015 )
Sec. 123-3. - Statement of findings.
(a)
The city finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. Left unregulated, however, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the overall economic growth of the city as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards & Sign Control available at http://www.scenie.org; Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP, The Public Purpose of Rowell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper, (December 7, 1999) available at http://roswellgov.com; Street Graphics and the Law, 2004 Revised Edition, Daniel Mandelker, Andrew Bertucci, and William Ewald, in particular, based on the cited materials and the studies referenced therein, as well as other related studies included in the city's file, the city finds that unregulated signs:
(1)
Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians;
(2)
Can create unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares throughout the city;
(3)
Can hamper economic growth;
(4)
Can lower property values;
(5)
Can adversely impact public investments;
(6)
Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and
(7)
Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment.
(b)
The city also finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such types of signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from traffic hazards such as downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying marks on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
(c)
Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

Window signs.
(1)
Allowed in all zoning districts in windows of occupied structures.
(2)
Area of window sign. The maximum area of the window sign shall be ten percent of the available glass area. Based on the definition of window sign, signage that is located inside the building within three feet of the window that is intended to be viewed from the outside is considered to be included in the window sign limitation. Available glass area shall be measured by considering an entire window unit exclusive of any mullions. In commercial zones other than B3 and CBD, one lighted window sign shall be allowed and may include neon or similar type signage. Said lighted window sign cannot be a sign which changes copy electronically using switches and electric lamps, or any other electronic means, or which flashes, blinks or scrolls.

(3)
Function.
a.
These signs are limited to a display of noncommercial speech or commercial speech that pertains to a commercial enterprise located on the property, such as a for sale sign, a sign reflecting the property's home occupation, a campaign sign, a political sign, or a yard sale sign, by way of examples.
b.
In the event that a court should adjudge any part of this subsection of the chapter a violation of the Georgia or United States Constitutions or any other provision of law, it is the specific intent of the city council that this provision referencing a limitation to noncommercial speech or commercial speech that pertains to a commercial enterprise located on the property be omitted from the chapter and the remainder of the chapter stay in effect to regulate signs on property within the city. This severance section is in addition to the legislative intent expressed elsewhere in this chapter.
(4)
Mounting devices. Informational signs shall be mounted on metal frames that do not exceed ¼ inch in diameter or when mounted on frames of other material cannot exceed three-fourths inch by 1½ inch in size. No message may be written on the mounting hardware, so that the entire message area of the sign is contained on the sign face itself.

Numerals displayed for the purpose of identifying property location affixed to a structure such as a mailbox or house, or placed on the ground, not to exceed eight inches in height.
(e)
Door signs not to exceed one square foot and not more than one sign per door.
(f)
Holiday lighting. In the B-3 and CBD, only holiday lighting in the form of white/clear only UL approved outdoor "Christmas" type lighting is permitted without historic commission review and approval. However, the period of display is limited to the two-month time period of the Friday preceding Thanksgiving Day through and including January 15, of the next succeeding year. Also prohibited are letters and/or words and/or phrases spelled and exhibited through the use of holiday lighting. This applies exclusively to outdoor lighting and not lighting inside the business premises itself as long as the lighting is at least three feet away from the window. There is no restriction on holiday lighting outside of the historic district.
(g)
Out-of-store marketing devices. Out-of-store marketing devices are allowed in nonresidential districts provided that they are too small to be legible to the traveling public on neighboring rights-of-way and are otherwise non-removable without damage to the equipment's surface, they do not require a permit and are not subject to overall sign limitations for the lot on which they appear.
