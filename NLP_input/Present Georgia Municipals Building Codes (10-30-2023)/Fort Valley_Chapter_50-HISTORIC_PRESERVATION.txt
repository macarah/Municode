Sec. 50-7. - Demolition or relocation of historic properties.
(a)
It is the policy of the city to encourage the preservation of historic buildings, structures, sites and areas which constitute a part of the historic fabric of the city or its respective neighborhood.
(b)
Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness to demolish or relocate a building or structure, or any part thereof, the commission shall review the circumstances and the condition of the building or structure, or part thereof, proposed for demolition or relocation and prepare a report of its findings. The report shall include factual data addressing the following criteria:
(1)
Is the building of such architectural or historical interest that its removal would be detrimental to the public interest?
(2)
Is the building of such old and unusual or uncommon design, texture and material that it could not be reproduced, or reproduced only with great difficulty?
(3)
Would retention of the building help preserve and protect an historic place or area of historic interest in the city?
(4)
Would retention of the building promote the general welfare by maintaining and increasing real estate values; generating business; creating new positions attracting tourists, students, writers, historians, artists and artisans; attracting new residents; encouraging study and interest in American history; or making the city or county a more desirable place in which to live?
(c)
Based on the report as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, the commission shall:
(1)
Determine that none of the criteria listed in subsection (b) of this section applies, and issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation;
(2)
Delay issuing the certificate of appropriateness for up to 90 days in order to allow persons or groups interested in historic preservation to work with the owner or applicant in an effort to preserve the structure or locate purchasers who would agree to preserve the building or structure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; or
(3)
Issue a certificate of appropriateness, if efforts at preservation prove unavailing. However, no certificate of appropriateness shall be issued for demolishing any structure listed specifically in the National Register of Historical Properties.

Cross reference— Repair, closing or demolition of buildings and structures, § 18-291 et seq.
Sec. 50-8. - Certain changes and uses not prohibited.
(a)
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on an historic property or property in an historic district when such maintenance or repair does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, nor prevents any owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other laws, ordinances or regulations.
(b)
Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on an historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage or to sustain existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. Change in paint color does not require a certificate of appropriateness; however, property owners are encouraged to seek advice from the commission when changing paint color. Application of all forms of siding (e.g., aluminum, vinyl, asphalt, etc.) does constitute a material change and requires a certificate of appropriateness.
(c)
Owners of designated historic properties or properties located in designated historic districts shall be required to maintain their property in accordance with existing laws of the city. The city historic preservation commission does not have the power to require special maintenance of historic properties or historic districts; however, the commission may request the appropriate city officials to take action on properties being neglected or not maintained in accordance with existing laws.
(Ord. of 10-21-1993, § VII)
