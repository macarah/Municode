ARTICLE 22C. - MILL VILLAGE DISTRICT OVERLAY (MV)

Sec. 2201C. - Purpose.
The purpose of the Mill Village District Overlay (MV) is to preserve the unique character and heritage of the residential areas of Spalding County that were previously located nearby to sites of former textile mills. Houses within the vicinities of the many textile mills located in Griffin and Spalding County were constructed to provide housing for employees of the nearby textile mill. Textile mills operating in Griffin and Spalding County during the late 19th and 20th centuries were the driving force of the economic and industrial development of Griffin and Spalding County.
These residential areas, known as Mill Villages, constituted unique neighborhoods generally located around the specific textile mill where the residents were employed. Houses in the Mill Village were constructed with a consistent architectural style and character, providing housing for either one (1) or two (2) families in a single structure. The unique character of the Mill Village was created by a streetscape of repetitive massing, construction, and design of homes with several different housing styles. The repetition of house forms and architectural design, at a neighborhood scale, created the unique character of the Mill Villages in Griffin and Spalding County.
The redevelopment and preservation of the architectural character and integrity of the Mill Villages will improve the aesthetics of the residential area, promote affordable home ownership and preserve the history of and recognize the contribution of the textile mill employees who were residents of the Mill Village to the economic development of Griffin and Spalding County. The Mill Village District Overlay will:
A.
Guide revitalization of the neighborhood;
B.
Protect and preserve the elements which provide the distinctive character and setting of the Mill Village; and
C.
Plan for new single-family residential infill construction that is compatible and complementary to the character of the existing neighborhood.
