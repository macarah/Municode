Chapter 21 - SIGNS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 21-1. - Purpose and findings.
The city council further finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city, further, finds that signs have become excessive and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are as follows:
(1)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to implement the policies and objectives of a comprehensive development plan of the city through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the city;
(2)
To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the city in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians;
(3)
To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed;
(4)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts;
(5)
To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the city;
(6)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city;
(7)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for advertisement by the business community located within the city so as to promote the economic vitality of local businesses;
(8)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the state constitution and the United States Constitution with the city;
(9)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts;
(10)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits;
(11)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
(12)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs; and
(13)
To provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

Sec. 21-63. - Owner's consent required.
No sign may be permitted or posted on property without the consent of the property's owner or authorized agent. Should it be determined that a sign was erected on a lot pursuant to an alleged agent's incorrect representation that the record owner of the lot in fact gave permission for the erection of a sign, the permit for such sign shall be revoked as provided in section 21-26.
(Ord. No. 2014-09-04, § 1(21-12), 9-23-2014; Ord. No. 2015-06-02, § 1(21-12), 6-9-2015; Ord. No. 2018-03-05 , § I, 3-27-2018)
Sec. 21-64. - Measurement of sign area and height.
(a)
The area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within 24 inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon. For double-faced signs, the side of the sign with the largest sign area shall be used in computing the sign area. For monument signs, sign area includes the face of the structure that the message is affixed to, not including the base subject to compliance with section 21-60(4) for exemption requirements.
(b)
The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required).
