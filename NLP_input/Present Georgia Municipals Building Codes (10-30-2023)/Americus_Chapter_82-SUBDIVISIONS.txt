Chapter 82 - SUBDIVISIONS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 82-1. - Definitions; street classifications.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alleys means minor ways used primarily for vehicular services access to the rear or sides of commercial or industrial properties.
Collector streets means a street used to carry traffic from minor streets to major streets, including the principal entrance streets to a neighborhood or group development and streets for circulation within such neighborhood or development.
Streets are as defined in section 1-2, and for the purposes of these regulations, streets are classified as follows:
Major streets means a street used primarily for fast or heavy traffic.
Minor streets means a street used primarily for access to the abutting properties.
Subdivision.
(1)
The term "subdivision" means any division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or the future sale, legacy or building development, and includes any division of land involving a new street or a change in one or more existing streets and includes resubdivision and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided.
(2)
Provided, however, the following are not included in this definition:
a.
The subdivision of land for agricultural purposes provided no lot thereby produced is less than five acres or no new street is involved.
b.
The sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining properties, provided that additional lots are not thereby created, and that the lots created are in accordance with other city regulations.
c.
The division of land into parcels where no new street is to be established and the resulting lots are equal to or larger than the standard required in the city, and a zoning classification of resulting lots remains the same as the zoning classification of the land before such division; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the rezoning, of such property on proper application and approval granted in accordance with this Code.
(Code 1986, § 19-1; Ord. No. O-97-03-05, 3-20-1997)
Sec. 82-2. - Zoning; conflict of standards.

ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURES FOR PLAT APPROVAL

Sec. 82-31. - Generally.
(a)
The procedure for formal review and approval of a subdivision plat shall consist of the following three separate steps:
(1)
The subdivider should consult early and informally with the community development director and/or other city technical staff for advice and assistance before the preparation of the preliminary sketch plat and its formal application for approval. This will enable the subdivider to become thoroughly familiar with these standards, the major street plan and other official plans or public improvements that might affect the area. Such informal review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions.
(2)
Prior to the making of any street improvement, or installations of utilities, the developer shall submit to the planning commission a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. After receiving the planning commission's approval of the preliminary plat and full concurrence and approval by the city, the developer may then proceed to grade the streets and install all improvements required by this chapter and any other applicable city ordinances. In lieu of the completion of all improvements prior to submission of the final plat, the developer may post a bond with the city, or certified check, in an amount and with surety satisfactory to the city and conditions satisfactory to the city, providing for and securing to the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements within a period specified by the planning commission and stated in the bond.
(3)
After completion of the physical development of the subdivision or the posting of a bond or certified check to guarantee the same, the developer shall submit to the planning commission a final plat together with any required certificates. The final plat, along with any deed restrictions, becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of this county.
(b)
No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the planning commission or accepted for record by the office of the clerk of the superior court of this county until the required improvements listed shall be constructed in satisfactory manner and approved by the appropriate approving agent.

ARTICLE III. - REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS

Sec. 82-57. - Basic requirements; minimum standards.
(a)
Land which the planning commission has found to be unsuitable for subdivision due to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, or other features likely to be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the future residents shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods approved by the planning commission are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by the subdivision of such land.
(b)
Land subject to flooding shall not be platted for residential occupancy or for such other uses, as will not comply with chapter 34, article II, the danger to health, life and property unless such land is not to be used as a building site. In applying this provision, land liable to flooding as determined from past history shall be considered subject to flood. Fill shall not be used to raise the land in areas subject to flood unless the fill proposed does not restrict the flow of water and unduly increase flood heights.
(Code 1986, § 19-30; Ord. No. O-97-03-05, 3-20-1997)
Sec. 82-58. - Streets.
(a)
Conformity to the major street plan. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official major street plan; i.e., provision must be made for the location of thoroughfares as shown on the major street plan.
(b)
Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system shall extend existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width. It shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjacent subdivisions or where no such streets exist, it shall follow the projection of streets in related subdivided tracts so that other subdivisions may connect therewith. The city reserves the right to require the developer to meet minimum road design standards.
(c)
Restriction of access. When a tract fronts on an arterial street or highway, the planning commission may require all residential lots to be provided with frontage on a minor residential street.
(d)
Street right-of-way widths. The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the major street plan, or if not shown on such plan, shall be not less than as follows:
(1)
Arterial streets and highways: 80 to120 feet.
(2)
Collector streets: 60 feet.
(3)
Commercial and industrial streets: 80 feet.
(4)
Minor residential streets:
a.
Curb and gutter: 50 feet.
b.
Ditches: 60 feet.
For both of the above, a 15-foot utility drainage easement shall be provided on each side of the right-of-way.
(e)
Exceptions. In cases where topography or other physical conditions made a street of the required minimum width impracticable, the planning commission may modify the above requirements. Through proposed business areas the street widths shall be increased ten feet on each side if needed to provide parking without interference to normal passing traffic.
(f)
Additional width on existing street. Subdivisions that join existing streets shall dedicate additional rights-of-way if needed to meet the above minimum street width requirements.
(1)
The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
(2)
When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway shall be provided.
(g)
Street grades and elevations. Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven percent and grades on other streets shall not exceed 12 percent.
(h)
Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than two degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets 60 feet or more in width, the centerline radius of curvature shall be not less than 300 feet; on other streets it shall not be less than 100 feet.
(i)
Vertical curves. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in rates of grade for major streets, and one-half this minimum length for other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet horizontally and one inch equals 20 feet vertically may be required by the planning commission upon recommendation of the city utilities director.
(j)
Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60 degrees. Property line radii at street intersections shall not be less than 20 feet, and where the angle of street intersection is less than 75 degrees the planning commission may require a greater curb radius. To permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be reduced or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction.
(k)
Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on all streets.
(l)
Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be allowed.
(m)
Dead-end streets.
(1)
Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed shall be no more than 600 feet long unless necessitated by topography. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 90 feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 110 feet for curb and gutter and 130 feet for ditches.
(2)
Where phases may be proposed a temporary turnaround shall be provided.
(n)

There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the city under conditions approved by the planning commission.
(o)
Street names. Proposed streets that are obviously, in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the names for proposed streets duplicate names of existing streets, irrespective of the use of the suffix "street," "avenue," "boulevard," "driveway," "place" or "court."
(p)
Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business purposes; alleys shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys.
(q)
Construction requirements.
(1)
Every subdivision developer shall be required to make adequate provision for handling drainage problems, to grade and improve streets and alleys, to install curbs or invert ditches and to install street name signs in accordance with specifications established by the city utilities director.
(2)
All street design and construction and related matters shall be in strict accordance with Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications, volume 1 "Construction of Roads and Bridges" and volume 2 "Materials for Roads and Bridges" and all revisions thereto. Where circumstances dictate variations from the standard specifications, the city utilities director may vary the requirements providing the design or materials accepted are in all ways commensurate with good practice.
(3)
All materials, equipment, labor and other matters related to street construction shall be provided by the developer. The following is a summary of the improvements required:
a.
Grading. All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded to their full width by the subdivider so that pavements and sidewalks, if installed in the future can be constructed on the same level plane. The preparation of the right-of-way before grading is started and the construction of cuts and fills shall be accomplished according to the specifications of the city.
b.
Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary curbs, pipes, culverts, headwalls, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, swale ditches, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water.
c.
Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied all of the underground work (water mains, gas mains, etc. and all service connections) shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. All driveways for houses to be built by the developer shall be cut and drained.
d.
Roadway base. After preparation of the subgrade, the roadbed shall be properly based with one of the following:

Sec. 82-59. - Blocks.
(a)
In general, blocks shall be not less than 400 feet, nor more than 1,200 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions peculiar to the site make such dimensions impracticable.
(b)
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets or prevented by topography conditions or size of the property, in which case the planning commission will approve a single tier or lots of minimum depth.
(Code 1986, § 19-32; Ord. No. O-97-03-05, 3-20-1997)
Sec. 82-60. - Lots.
(a)
Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot shall front upon a public street or road that is not less than 50 feet in width. Each lot shall be at least 30 feet in width at the front property line.
(b)
Minimum size. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such, as the planning commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated. Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such sewer and provide a connection to each lot. Where a public sewer is not accessible, an alternate method of sewage disposal may be used when meeting all applicable public health regulations.
(1)
Residential lots served by a public sewer system shall be not less than 60 feet wide at the building setback line, nor less than 7,000 square feet in area. Where a rural ditch section is used, each lot shall maintain a 100-foot width at the setback line, not less than 13,000 square feet in size, and maintain a minimum frontage at the right-of-way line of 50 feet. Where a cul-de-sac is constructed using the rural ditch section method, the maximum number of lots on a cul-de-sac shall be five lots, with a minimum right-of-way diameter of 130 feet, and a minimum paving diameter being 90 feet.
(2)
For residential lots not served by a public sewer system, the planning commission shall require that data from percolation tests be submitted as a basis for approving subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage disposal, and no lot shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building line, nor less than 15,000 square feet in area.
(3)
For residential lots not served by a public water supply or a public sewer system, no lot shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building line, nor less than one acre in size except upon approval of the county health officer and in no case shall any lot be less than one-half acre in size.
(4)
The minimum size of residential lots to be served by a private source of water supply shall be determined by the county health officer after investigations of soil conditions, proposed sewer system and depth of groundwater.
(5)
Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots shall be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes.
(6)
The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the minimum requirements of the zoning regulations in effect.
(c)
Building setback lines. The minimum depth of building setback lines from any street shall be 30 feet. If, however, suitable provision is made in connection with the plat or restrictions pertaining to the plat, building lines may be varied, provided such variation does not reduce the setback more than five feet. Where rural ditch section construction for a subdivision is used the minimum building setback line from any street right-of-way shall be 50 feet for any zoning district.
(d)
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the additional side yard requirements of the zoning regulations or building setback lines outlined above.
(Code 1986, § 19-33; Ord. No. O-97-03-05, 3-20-1997)

(b)
Sewer. When the subdivision is located within the service area of a public sewer system, sanitary sewers shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with connection to the public system. Where lots cannot be economically connected with a sewer system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of approved septic tank and disposal fields and must be approved in writing by the county health officer. All materials, equipment, labor, and other matters related to the sanitary sewer system shall be provided by the developer and all sewer facilities shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the department of human resources of the state and standards of the city.
(c)
Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied to the street, all of the underground work, water mains, gas mains, etc., and all service connections shall be installed completed and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. Where the utility mains are off the pavement, the developer may elect to omit the installation of service connections providing that at such time as these service connections are needed, they may be jacked across the street without breaking or weakening the existing pavement.
(d)
Easements for utilities. Except where alleys are permitted for that purpose, the city may require easements for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, and water mains or other utility lines, along rear lot lines or side lot lines, if, in the opinion of the city utilities director such action is desirable. Easements of the same or greater width may be required along the line of or across lots, where necessary for the extension of existing or planned utilities. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way along each side for the purpose of widening, depending, relocating, improving or protecting such drainage easement.

Street lighting. Either underground or overhead electrical service shall be provided by the developer of a subdivision, through a public utility. All subdivisions with underground electrical lines shall have placed appropriate utility poles for street lighting. The installation of streetlights shall adhere to the following requirements: streetlights shall be installed at each street intersection and streetlights that are to be installed along the proposed blocks shall be equally spaced between street intersections. However, the maximum distance between any two streetlights shall not exceed 400 feet in length. After construction has been completed for an accepted phase or for an entire subdivision, and where the streets have been dedicated to the city, the city will be responsible for the costs associated with the operation of the streetlights. Streetlight design, size, and wattage must be approved by the city as part of the preliminary platting process. For example, a block 800 feet in length, it would be necessary to install three streetlights. For a block 1,100 feet in length, four streetlights would be necessary.

All other lot, corners shall be marked with iron pipe not less than three-fourths inches in diameter and 24 inches long and driven so as to be flush with the finished grade.

Sec. 82-64. - Group housing developments.
A comprehensive group housing development, including the large scale construction of housing units together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by the planning commission although the design of the project does not include standard street, lot and subdivision arrangements, if departure from the foregoing standards can be made without destroying their intent. The developer shall provide proof that adequate access is provided for emergency vehicles.
