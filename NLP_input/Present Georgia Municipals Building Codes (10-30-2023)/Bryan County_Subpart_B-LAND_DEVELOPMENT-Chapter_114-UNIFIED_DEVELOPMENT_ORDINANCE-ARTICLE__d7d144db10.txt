ARTICLE II. - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES
This article establishes all development procedures and the minimum criteria for development approvals.

Sec. 114-200. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish procedures for filing and processing applications for development approval. The format is designed to allow users to determine the steps involved to obtain development approval.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-201. - Procedural requirements.
No development is permitted unless all applicable approvals are issued in accordance with this UDO. Development approvals are required for all development, unless otherwise exempted, to ensure compliance with adopted codes, standards, and laws, and to ensure consistency with the comprehensive plan. This article describes procedural elements common to all applications. The specific procedures followed in reviewing various applications for development approval differ. Subsequent articles address the specific procedures and requirements for particular applications. Generally, the procedures for all applications have five common elements:
(a)
Submittal of a complete application, including required fee payments and appropriate information and studies;
(b)
Review of the submittal by appropriate staff, agencies, and boards;
(c)
A decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny, together with the description of the actions authorized and the time period for exercising rights;
(d)
Options to amend or appeal the decision; and
(e)
Documenting the decision.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-202. - Approvals required.
Except as specifically exempted by State law, the use of property may not be substantially changed, substantial clearing, grading or excavation may not be commenced, land may not be subdivided, and buildings or other substantial structures may not be constructed, erected, moved, occupied or substantially altered except in accordance with and pursuant to this UDO. Required development approval types, responsibilities for action and references to applicable UDO sections are listed in Exhibit 202. An "(H)" indicates that a public hearing is required prior to action by the applicable hearing body.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-203. - Authority to condition development approvals.
(a)
County staff, the P&Z commission, board of adjustment, building and construction board of appeals, and the board of commissioners may impose conditions as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with applicable general or specific standards identified in this UDO after review of the application and other pertinent documents and any evidence made part of the public record.
(b)
Any conditions recommended by the community development director, development review committee, or P&Z commission may be modified subsequently by the board of commissioners.

(3)
Review for completeness of application forms is solely for the purpose of determining whether preliminary information required for submission with the application is sufficient to allow further processing, and shall not constitute a decision as to whether application complies with the provisions of the UDO.
(4)
The community development director may agree to process an application without all required information at the risk to the applicant that the hearing body may later require the information prior to acting on the application.
(b)
Time limits for completeness determination.

Not later than five business days after the community development director has received an application, the community development director shall determine whether the application is complete and either notify the applicant at the DRC meeting or via written correspondence of required materials needed to correct the deficiencies.
(2)
If the application requires review by any other local or special district, or regional, State, or federal agency or entity, the applicant shall provide a listing of outside agency approvals required for the project before the application is deemed complete.
(3)
If the application, together with the submitted materials, is determined not to be complete:
a.
The community development or engineering director shall specify in writing the information required.

d.
If appealed, the board of adjustment or building and construction board of appeals shall render a final written determination on the appeal not later than the next available meeting after receipt of the applicant's written appeal.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-214. - Continuance.
(a)
Nothing in this section precludes an applicant and county staff from mutually agreeing to a continuance or extension of any time limit provided by this section.
(b)
If the community development director receives the written request for a continuance prior to the public hearing being noticed, the applicant's request for a continuance will be automatically granted. An applicant is not entitled to more than two automatic continuances.
(c)
If the community development director receives the written request for a continuance after the public hearing is noticed, the applicant is not entitled to an automatic continuance. The hearing body will consider the request for a continuance and shall only grant such request upon a demonstration by the applicant of good cause for a continuance.
(d)
If an applicant receives a continuance, the applicant shall reimburse the county for all advertising costs associated with rescheduling the public hearing for the application. The reimbursement fee must be paid prior to the county posting the advertisement.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-215. - Minor amendments and major amendments.

(6)
Changing the method of providing water and sewer service.
(d)
The community development director may postpone the consideration of the application by the public hearing body if the community development director determines additional time is needed to fully evaluate the proposed amendments, minor or major. If the applicant does not agree to the postponement, the community development director or engineering director may recommend denial of the application.
(e)
If the proposed amendment is determined to be a major amendment, as identified in paragraph (c) and the public noticing has already been posted/advertised, the community development director shall re-notice the application and consideration of the application shall be delayed for a month if the applicant agrees to the postponement.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-216. - Withdrawal of applications.

For the purposes of this section, "withdrawal" is defined as the retraction of a filed application, either for amendment and re-submission or for permanent revocation. Should the hearing body defer consideration of an application to its next meeting, either at the request of the applicant or upon its own initiative, such deferral of consideration shall not constitute "withdrawal" and shall not trigger the limitations on resubmission set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-217. - Approvals.
(a)
Effect on successors and assigns. Development approvals are transferable if the use of land or structures or any portion thereof subject to the approval continues to comply with all the terms and requirements of that approval.
(b)
Amendments to development approvals.
(1)
The community development director may authorize minor amendments to development approvals as defined in subsequent sections of this UDO upon finding that the amendment has no discernible impact on neighboring properties, the general public or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development.
(2)
All other requests for changes in approved plans will be processed as a modification to the original application, and new conditions may be imposed only on the specific site or area requested to be modified. The applicant retains the right to withdraw the request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit.
