Sec. 10-11. - Board of appeals.
(a)
General. In order to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions or determinations made by the building official relative to the application and interpretation of this code, there shall be and is hereby created a board of appeals. The building official shall be an ex officio member of said board, but shall have no vote on any matter before the board. The board of appeals shall be appointed by the governing authority when needed to hear an appeal and shall hold office at its pleasure.
(b)
Limitations on authority. An application for appeal shall be based on a claim that the true intent of this code or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been incorrectly interpreted, the provisions of this code do not fully apply, or an equally good or better form of construction is proposed. The board shall have no authority to waive requirements of this code.
(1)
Determination of substantial improvement in areas prone to flooding. When the building official provides a finding in section 10-4(c)(7)b, the board of appeals shall determine whether the value of the proposed work constitutes a substantial improvement. A substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the building or structure has sustained substantial damage, all repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not include:
a.
Improvements of a building or structure required to correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the building official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions.
b.
Any alteration of a historic building or structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the continued designation as an historic building or structure.
(2)
Criteria for issuance of a variance for areas prone to flooding. A variance shall only be issued upon:
a.
A showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuring or topography of the site render the elevation standards inappropriate.
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable.
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
d.
A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard.
e.
Submission to the applicant of written notice specifying the difference between the design flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built, stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate to the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation, and stating that construction below the design flood elevation increases risks to life and property.
(c)
Qualifications. The board of appeals shall consist of members who are qualified by experience and training to pass on matters pertaining to building construction and are not employees of the jurisdiction.
(1)
The board shall consist of at least four (including the building official) members. In addition to the regular members, there should be two alternate members who shall be members at-large from the building industry. A board member shall not act in a case in which he/she/they has/have a personal or financial interest.
(2)
The terms of office of the board member shall be staggered, so no more than one-third of the board is appointed or replaced in any 12-month period. The two alternates, if appointed, shall serve one-year terms. Vacancies shall be filled for an unexpired term in the manner in which original appointments are required to be made. Continued absence of any member from required meetings of the board shall, at the discretion of the applicable governing body, render any such member subject to immediate removal from office.
(d)
Quorum and voting. A simple majority of the board shall constitute a quorum. In varying any provision of the construction codes, the affirmative votes of the majority present shall be required. In modifying a decision of the building official, not less than two affirmative votes shall be required. In the event that regular members are unable to attend a meeting, the alternate member, if appointed, shall vote.
(e)
Secretary of the board. The building official shall act as secretary of the board and shall make detailed record of all its proceedings, which shall set forth the reasons for its decision, the vote of each member, the absence of a member and any failure of a member to vote.
(f)
Administration. The building official shall take immediate action in accordance with the decision of the board.

In the event that the governing authority of any county finds that the state minimum standard codes do not meet its needs, the local government may provide requirements not less stringent than those specified in the state minimum, standard codes when such requirements are based on local climatic, geologic, topographic, or public safety factors; provided, however, that there is a determination by the local governing body of a need to amend the requirements of the state minimum standard code based upon a demonstration by the local governing body that local conditions justify such requirements not less stringent than those specified in the state minimum standard codes for the protection of life and property. All such proposed amendments shall be submitted by the local governing body to the department of community affairs 60 days prior to the adoption of such amendment. Concurrent with the submission of the proposed amendment to the department, the local governing body shall submit in writing the legislative findings of the governing body and such other documentation as the local governing body deems helpful in justifying the proposed amendment. The department shall review and comment on a proposed amendment. Such comment shall be in writing and shall be sent to the submitting local government with a recommendation:
(1)
That the proposed local amendment should not be adopted, due to the lack of sufficient evidence to show that such proposed local amendment would be as stringent as the state minimum standard codes and the lack of sufficient evidence to show that local climatic, geologic, topographic, or public safety factors require such an amendment;
(2)
That the proposed local amendment should be adopted, due to a preponderance of evidence that such proposed local amendment would be as stringent as the state minimum standard codes and a preponderance of evidence that the local climatic, geologic, topographic, or public safety factors require such an amendment; or
(3)
That the department has no recommendation regarding the adoption or disapproval of the proposed local amendments, due to the lack of sufficient evidence to show that such proposed local amendment would or would not be as stringent as the state minimum standard codes and the lack of sufficient evidence to show that local climatic, geologic, topographic, or public safety factors require or do not require such an amendment.
(b)
The department shall have 60 days after receipt of a proposed local amendment to review the proposed amendment and make a recommendation as set forth in subsection (a) of this section. In the event that the department fails to respond within the time allotted, the local governing body may adopt the proposed local amendment.
(c)
In the event that the department recommends against the adoption of the proposed local amendment, a local governing body shall specifically vote to reject the department's recommendations before any local amendment may be adopted.
(d)
No local amendment shall become effective until the local governing body has caused a copy of the adopted amendment to be filed with the department. A copy of an amendment shall be deemed to have been filed with the department when it has been placed in the United States mail, return receipt requested.

Minimum Setback Requirements
Wind Energy
Facility Type Occupied Buildings on Participating Landowner Property Occupied Buildings on Non-Participating Landowner Property Property Lines on Non-Participating Landowner Property Public Roads Public/Private
Right-of-Way
Class I and II 1.1 1.5 1.1 1.1 1.5
Class III 1.1 2.0 1.5 1.5 1.5
Class IV 1.1 2.5 1.5 1.5 1.5
NOTE: Turbine height restrictions are not included because they will be determined in the public hearing approval process.
  (1)
Setbacks are measured from the center of the wind turbine base to the property line, public road, or nearest point on the foundation of an occupied building. Setbacks are calculated by multiplying the required setback number by the wind turbine height. (i.e., setback (1.1) = 1.1 x height of turbine). For example, a 100 foot turbine should be at least 110 feet away from any public road line or to the edge of a building structure on the property or adjacent property.
(2)
If a wind energy facility is sited on multiple properties, the lot size is the sum of all participating landowners.
(3)
These setbacks are designed to reduce noise and shadow flicker impacts to any previously existing occupied buildings on adjacent properties.
(Ord. No. O-120418a, § 25-105, 12-4-2018)
Sec. 10-333. - Noise and shadow flicker.
(a)
Audible sound from a wind energy facility shall not exceed 55 dBA at any time, as measured at the property line of a non-participating landowner.
(b)
Shadow flicker at any occupied building on a non-participating landowner's property caused by a wind turbine facility located within 2,500 feet of the occupied building existing at the time of initial operation of the facility shall not exceed 30 hours per year.
(Ord. No. O-120418a, § 25-106, 12-4-2018)
Sec. 10-334. - Permit requirement.
(a)
Permits are required for building, special use, and other action based activity tied to this article. A wind energy facility, or addition of a wind turbine to an existing wind energy facility, shall not be constructed unless a permit has been issued to the facility owner or operator approving construction of the facility under this article. Permit application of the expansion shall be based on the total rated capacity, including existing facility but excluding like kind replacements of equipment.
(b)
