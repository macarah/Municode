(1)
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, human trafficking, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
(2)
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
(3)
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

At the hearing, the petitioner shall have the opportunity to present all relevant arguments and to be represented by counsel, present evidence and witnesses on his or her behalf, and cross-examine any of the city manager's witnesses.

The hearing shall take no longer than one day, unless extended at the request of the petitioner to meet the requirements of due process and proper administration of justice. The petitioner shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no substantial evidence to support the city manager's licensing decision. The hearing officer shall affirm the city manager's licensing decision if any substantial evidence in the record at the hearing supports any of the grounds set forth in the written notice of intent to deny, suspend, or revoke.

(3)
If the decision is to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, the decision shall advise the petitioner of the right to appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction, and the decision shall not become effective until the tenth day after it is rendered.

If the petitioner is not yet licensed, the city manager shall contemporaneously therewith issue the license to the applicant.
(b)
If any court action challenging a licensing decision is initiated, the city shall consent to expedited briefing and/or disposition of the action, shall comply with any expedited schedule set by the court, and shall facilitate prompt judicial review of the proceedings.

The provisional license shall allow the respondent to continue operation of the sexually oriented business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented business employee and will expire upon the court's entry of a judgment on the respondent's appeal or other action to restrain or otherwise enjoin the city's enforcement.

For the purpose of this section, measurements shall be made in a straight line from the closest part of any structure occupied by the sexually oriented business to the closest property line of the zoned property and uses outlined in subsection (a), above. Where property conditioned for residential purposes is part of a mixed use development, the distance shall be measured to the closest boundary of the area shown on the approved site plan as conditioned for residential purposes. Where a use listed in subsection (a) is located in a multi-tenant development, the distance shall be measured to the closest part of the tenant space occupied by that use rather than the property line of the entire development, so as to maximize the number of locations available to sexually oriented businesses. The zoning and/or use of land in adjacent jurisdictions shall not disqualify any location within the city from being available to a sexually oriented business.
(c)
Notwithstanding any provision in this Code to the contrary, a sexually oriented business in a location that satisfies the standards in this section shall not be deemed noncompliant with this section by virtue of the subsequent establishment or expansion of a land use or zoning district identified in subsection (a).

(ii)
Has continuously, lawfully operated since this section was adopted; and
(iii)
Does not conform to the location standards for sexually oriented businesses set forth in this section 14-449 or in the city zoning resolution.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code, a lawful nonconforming sexually oriented business may continue to operate in its nonconforming location until December 31, 2022, in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in said location that was made before the adoption of this section. On or before January 1, 2023, the sexually oriented business shall conform to the location standards for sexually oriented businesses in this Code.
(3)
Hardship extension. A lawful nonconforming sexually oriented business may apply to extend the time to operate its sexually oriented business in its nonconforming location upon a showing of financial hardship. An application for an initial extension based upon financial hardship shall be made by October 31, 2022.
