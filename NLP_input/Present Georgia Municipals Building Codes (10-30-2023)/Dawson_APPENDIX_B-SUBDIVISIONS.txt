ARTICLE III. - PLATTING REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS

Sec. A. - Conformity with statutes and this subdivision ordinance.
No subdivision or plat shall be approved by the planning commission or the council unless same is in conformance with the statutes of the State of Georgia, the ordinances of the City of Dawson, and this subdivision ordinance.
(1)
Streets:
a.
General design: All streets shall be graded to conform with the existing terrain and provide proper drainage to meet existing state highway specifications. Where curbs and gutters are not used, shoulders shall be grassed and meet highway specifications with a minimum width of five (5) feet on each side of paving. A five-to-one slope shall be maintained. All streets in the subdivision shall be designed so that, in the opinion of the planning commission, they will provide means for safe vehicular travel. Due consideration shall also be given by the subdivider to the attractiveness of the street layout in order to obtain the maximum livability and amenity of the subdivision.
b.
Dedication of streets, alleys, and easements: As noted in the previous section, all streets, alleys, and easements must be dedicated to the public. The use of any parcel or portion of the subdivision for a private street shall be prohibited.
c.
Relation to adjoining street pattern: The arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall make provision for the continuation of principal existing streets in adjoining or adjacent subdivision, insofar as they may be necessary for public requirements. In general, such streets shall be of a width as great as that of the street so continued or projected, except that no such street extension shall be of less right-of-way width than that required in section III-A(1)"l" entitled street right-of-way widths, of this ordinance. The center line of such streets shall continue with the center line of existing streets. The streets shall extend to the boundary of the subdivision to provide for the proper access to the adjoining property, and provide for the proper connection with the highway system for contiguous land.
Where the planning commission has adopted a plat or plats of a neighborhood or area of which the subdivision is a part, approval may be given to the subdivider's plat by the planning commission and the council. Where the plat submitted covers only a part of the subdivider's tract, a sketch of a proposed future street system of the unsubmitted part shall be considered in the light of adjustments and connections with the street system of the part not submitted.
The street system of the submitted plat must conform to any and all provisions of this ordinance, especially the street and traffic plan.
d.
Access to property: Each residential lot within a subdivision shall be provided with a satisfactory means of access. Building permits shall not be issued for the construction of buildings which do not have access on a public street. There shall be no reserve strips controlling or prohibiting access to a street or adjoining property.
e.
Large allotments: Where the parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for building lots, the platting shall not be such as to stop the opening of major streets and the extension of adjacent minor streets, which in the judgment of the planning commission should ultimately be opened and extended.
f.
Street intersections: Streets shall be required to intersect each other at as nearly right angles as practicable, and in no case shall the angle of intersection be less than sixty (60) degrees. Streets converging at one (1) point shall be reduced to the least practicable number. Exceptions shall be treated individually.
g.
Street jogs: Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet will not be permitted. Where streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be contiguous.
h.
Streets in relation to railroads: Whenever a subdivision adjoins or includes a railroad right-of-way, a street shall be placed parallel to the railroad to intercept streets tending to otherwise cross the tracks. Any intersection occurring on a street which crosses the railroad track shall not be less than four hundred (400) feet from the nearest railroad right-of-way. Greater distances may be required if it is deemed necessary for safety, approach gradients, or future grade separations.
i.
Dedication of half-streets: The dedication of half-streets will not be permitted where a subdivision adjoins undeveloped property. Wherever there already exists a dedicated and recorded half-street or half-alley on an adjoining plat, the other half must be dedicated on the proposed plat to make the street or alley complete.
j.
Dead-end street and cul-de-sacs: Dead-end streets shall be defined as streets which will not or can not be extended through to another street in the future. Such streets shall be deemed permanently dead-end streets and will not be approved if they exceed four hundred (400) feet in length as measured from the right-of-way line of the nearest cross street to the center of the cul-de-sac. Every permanent dead-end street shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around with a minimum radius of forty (40) feet and a street property line diameter of at least one hundred (100) feet. However, under specific existing conditions, where topographic conditions indicate hardship would be caused if this requirement were strictly enforced and where an exception to this regulation might serve the best interest of the city, the planning commission may allow an extension of a dead-end street up to a total length of not more than six hundred (600) feet.
k.
Residential and accessory building lines and setback lines: Building lines shall conform to the minimum requirements of thirty (30) feet from any street line. Building lines for structures fronting on a side street shall be not less than thirty (30) feet.

n.
Street curvature: A minimum of one hundred (100) feet tangent shall be introduced between reverse curves on minor residential streets. On collector streets, a tangent of one hundred fifty (150) feet shall be used between reverse curves. On arterial or major streets a tangent of six hundred (600) to eight hundred (800) feet shall be used.
o.
Corner radii: Curb corners shall be rounded or cut back to provide for a curb radius of not less than twenty (20) feet. Special cases due to existing conditions will be considered individually on the basis of safety and overall design.
p.

f.
Corner lots: Corner lots shall be provided extra width sufficient to permit the maintenance of building setback lines on both the front and side street lines in order to protect similar setbacks on both the front and side streets which exist or are planned.
Where lots have side yards abutting upon a street, on the same side of which other residential lots front in the same block, the lots shall be of such width to permit a side yard setback on the street equivalent to the required front yard setback of the lots fronting on said street.
g.
Lots at right angles: Lots at right angles to each other should be avoided whenever possible, especially in residential areas.
h.
Large lots: In case a tract is subdivided into parcels containing one (1) or more acres, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the re-subdivision of any parcels into normal lots in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.

  Sec. A. - Compliance; conflict.
Compliance with these Subdivision Regulations shall be a prerequisite to the approval by the planning commission and the council of any plat or subdivision except insofar as such regulations may be in conflict with any applicable state law.
Sec. B. - Penalty.
Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of these regulations, whether such person be the owner or agent of the owner of the property, shall be fined not to exceed the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00), and the cost of the prosecution or by imprisonment for not more than sixty (60) days, or both, at the discretion of the court. Each day such violation shall exist shall constitute a separate offense. Furthermore, all persons shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 19 of the Georgia General Act No. 358, 1957, as amended.
Note— See note § 1-C.
Sec. C. - Validity.
Should any section, clause or provision of these regulations be declared by the courts to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of these regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the part so declared to be invalid.
Sec. D. - Variances.
The council may permit variances from these criteria provided that such variances are not in conflict with the intent and purpose of these regulations, and provided, further, that strict compliance with these criteria would render a particular parcel of land unplattable.
Sec. E. - Amendments.
The planning commission and the council may, after public hearing, amend, supplement, or change these regulations in the same manner as the regulations adopted by the city.
