Employees must publicly disclose all potential purchase conflicts prior to any purchasing decisions being made.
The city shall seek to obtain the best quality products and services at the lowest possible price in the most convenient manner under all circumstances. However, local vendors should be supported to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing quality or price.

Competitive sealed bidding process:

Invitation & Notice - An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. Adequate public notice of the invitation to bids shall be given not less than ten calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids for contracts under $50,000.00 and 30 days for contract over $50,000.00. Such notice shall include publication in a newspaper of general circulation. The public notice and all invitations to bid shall state the place, date, and time of bid opening and shall state that the bids should be submitted to the purchasing agent.
(2)
Bid Opening - Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of more than one witness at the place and not earlier than the time designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid and such other relevant information as the city deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder shall be open to public inspection in accordance with the policy.
(3)
Bid Evaluation and Acceptance - Bids received at or prior to the time set for bid opening shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this policy. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measureable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluations that are not set forth in the invitation to bids.
(4)
Correction or Withdrawal of Bids - Subject to any provisions of federal or state granting authorities to the contrary, correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts basis on such bid mistakes, shall be in accordance with this section. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, no corrections to bid or provisions shall be permitted but, in lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if:
(A)
The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document; or
(B)
The bidder submits evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids shall be supported by a written determination by the city.
(b)
Multi-step sealed bidding: When it is considered impractical to prepare initially a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
(c)
Cancellation of invitations: An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other solicitation may be cancelled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation. Each solicitation issued by the city shall state that the solicitation may be cancelled and that any bid or proposal by be rejected in whole or in part at the city's discretion with or without a showing of good cause. (All bids shall include the following statement: "The City of Springfield has the right to reject any or all bids if doing so is in the best interest of the City.")
(d)
Determination of non-responsive: If a bidder does not meet all the terms, conditions and specifications of the bid the bid will be considered non-responsive during the bid opening. A written determination of non-responsiveness, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the purchasing agent and approved by the city manager. A copy of the determination shall be made part of the contract file and be made public record. Examples where a bid may be considered non-responsive include: the bid is incomplete, not signed, or late, there are discrepancies in the bid, bidder not attending a mandatory pre-bid conference or not submitting a bid bond.
(e)
Determination of non-responsibility: If a bidder who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found non-responsible, a written determination of non-responsibility, setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the purchasing agent and approved by the city manager. The unreasonable failure of a bidder to supply promptly information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of non-responsibility with respect to such bidder. A copy of the determination shall be made part of the contract file and be made public record. Examples where a bidder may be considered not responsible include poor references, bidder does not have proper business registration or licenses, banned from working with other agencies, not qualified as a foreign corporation, or questions about financial capability to perform.
(f)
Right of nondisclosure: Information furnished by a bidder in reliance upon a written offer of confidentiality by the city pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed by the city outside of the office of the purchasing agent or using agency without prior written consent by the bidder.
(g)
Use of subcontractors: All contracts between the City of Springfield and its consultants, vendors, and contractors shall state that "should you (the consultant, vendor, or contractor) utilize subcontractors, vendors or consultants to fulfill this contract with the City, you agree to use all reasonable efforts to include Effingham County based businesses in your bidding process."
(h)
Bid and payment bonds: Bids and payment bonds or other security may be requested for supply contracts or service contracts, as the city attorney deems advisable to protect the city's interest. Any such bonding requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Bid or payment bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder's responsibility.
