Sections:
17.112.010 - Purpose.
A special use permit shall be required where a special use listed under a zoning district is desired for development. The city shall consider application for such special use subject to review and determination that the proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan, is located, designed and operated in a manner that is in harmony with neighboring development and does not adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(Ord. No. 08-12-29, § XVII(2), 12-29-2008)

In reviewing a special use permit application, the city council shall consider the following:

B.
The potential adverse impacts on storm drainage;

The potential adverse impacts on surrounding land values;
D.
The compatibility with surrounding land use activities;
