Chapter 106 - ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 106-1—106-18. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sec. 106-19. - Findings, title and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact.
(1)
The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
(2)
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
(3)
It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the "Wetland Protection Ordinance" of the city. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
(Code 1996, § 42-101; Ord. No. 01-03-22B, § 1, 3-22-2001)
Sec. 106-20. - Wetland protection district boundaries.
The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Code 1996, § 42-102; Ord. No. 01-03-22B, § 2, 3-22-2001)
Sec. 106-21. - Local development permit requirements.
(a)
Requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the building inspector using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(b)
Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(7)
Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city or its designee for the following reasons:
a.
Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the pubic to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city or their designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
b.
Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
c.
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use.
d.
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.
(c)
Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of not less than one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information:
(1)
A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings.
(2)
A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant.
(3)
Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 100 feet.
(4)
The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body.
(5)
Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent.
(6)
Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials.
(7)
All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology.
(d)
Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the city or its designee. The city or its designee may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article.
(e)
Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options:
(1)
Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The city or its designee may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The city or its designee shall require no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot.
(2)
Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the city or its designee will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.
(f)
Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the city or its designee. Filing fees up to a maximum of $100.00 may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the city or its designee.
(g)
Enforcement authority. The building inspector is hereby established as the administrator of this article.
(h)
Review procedures. The application shall be made to the building inspector and will be reviewed within 30 days. The review period shall begin upon determination by the building inspector that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval or disapproval) by the building inspector. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the city or its designee. If the review process is not completed within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved.
(i)
Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the building inspector may be appealed to the mayor and city council. The appeal must be made within 30 days of the decision rendered by the building inspector. A public hearing shall be held for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the mayor and city council may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as discussed section 106-23.
(j)

Sec. 106-28. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Functions mean the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habit for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities.
Generalized wetland map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city, as indicated on the National Wetlands Inventory Map.
Hydric soils mean soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the Soil Conservation Service.
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 106-21(b)(7).
Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.

APPENDIX—SOURCE MATERIAL FOR THE PREPARATION OF GENERALIZED WETLAND MAPS
(1)
National Wetlands Inventory Maps (NWI). NWI maps are the most commonly used maps. Most of these maps are at scales of 1:24,000 and correspond to United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps. The minimum area mapped is usually one to three acres. Small wetlands and very narrow wetlands in river corridors may be missed.
These maps were developed from interpretations of available aerial photographs; therefore, mapped boundaries of wetlands do not reflect jurisdictional boundaries (as would be determined if the federal delineation manual were used on the ground).
Only a small portion of the maps has been "ground-truthed," but nationwide efforts to assess the accuracy of the maps have been extensive. Accuracy varies upward from about 60 percent, with most maps being at least 90 percent accurate.
The strength of these maps is the spatial resolution (often to within one acre, which is relatively good). NWI maps identify the location of wetlands and indicate wetland type using the Cowardin classification scheme.
The limitations of these maps are that wetlands that were cultivated at the time of mapping are generally not depicted and forested wetlands are poorly discriminated. In some areas, these two wetland types are a major portion of the wetlands resource. Particularly in areas of rapid growth and accelerated wetlands loss, many maps have become quickly outdated.

(2)
County Soil Survey Maps. These maps range in scale from 1:15,840 to 1:31,680. Soil maps do not delineate wetlands, but rather their presence may be inferred from the occurrence of soils classified as "hydric" by the Soil Conservation Service. From accompanying soil interpretation record data, wetlands might cautiously be classified by type. These maps were developed by trained soil scientists who examined vertical soil profiles at regular intervals along ground transects and generalized subjectively from them to the surrounding landscape on the basis of landform, vegetation and other factors.
These maps do not specify wetland type as do the NWI maps. Most published soil surveys report the acreage of each soil series in the survey area. Soil survey maps are extensively used as a secondary data source for wetlands mapping. However, hydric soil inclusions (patches of hydric soil too small to map) are probably common in many soils mapped as non-hydric, but the extent to which this occurs is unknown. It should also be noted that some soils classified as hydric are not hydric everywhere they are mapped; marginally hydric soils indicate wetlands only in certain landscape positions. Caution should therefore be used when inferring the presence of wetlands from soils classified and mapped as hydric.
The advantage of using these maps is that they are sometimes available in areas where NWI maps are not yet available. Soil surveys might be used, with caution, to infer locations of cropped wetlands not included in NWI maps; to differentiate among some wetland functional types (alluvial seasonally flooded vs. isolated seasonally flooded) when linked with the SCS SOILS database which describes the physical properties of each soil series; and to categorize hydrologic and water purification function of specific wetlands.
Limitations of these maps are numerous. Many small but cumulatively significant areas that often are wetlands (with hydric soil inclusions) are not mapped because the soil classification systems used in soil survey maps classify soils in landscape groupings. Aquatic bed and many tidal or permanently flooded wetlands are typically mapped as open water, not wetlands, on SCS maps. Areas classified as having hydric soils are not always wetlands, in part because they may have been drained (either prior to or after the survey was conducted). This can lead to overestimation of current wetlands acreage. Many drained hydric soils can retain sufficient "hydric" features to result in their being classified by soil mappers as hydric even after decades of continuous drainage. Conversely, not all wetlands contain soils that are classified as hydric, and this can lead to underestimation of wetlands acreage. Wetlands may be the result of recent impoundment; in such areas, it typically takes at least a decade for hydric soil features to appear. Moreover, even the soils of some wetlands with hydric characteristics that have existed for decades do not appear on the SCS hydric soils list.
Maps are available through: U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service field offices (generally located in the county seat of each county).
(3)
State Soil Geographic Data Base (STATSGO) and National Soil Geographic Data Base (NATSGO) maps.
STATSGO maps are available at 1:250,000 scale with about 100 acres resolution. Digital coverage maps will be available by late 1993. These maps include soils on federal land.
NATSGO maps are available at 1:3,000,000 and are currently available showing the entire United States. They do not include federal land.
STATSGO maps are generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. SCS has determined the map unit composition (the groupings of soil types mapped as a single polygon or unit) by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed SCS county soil survey maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize each whole map unit.
Wetlands themselves are not delineated; rather their presence may be inferred from the presence of soils officially considered "hydric." From accompanying SOILS data, which describe the physical properties of each soil series, these wetlands landscapes might cautiously be classified by function.
NATSGO maps are also generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. Map units are the polygons of SCS's Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) map. The sample points of the National Resources Inventory (NRI) are statistically aggregated within each MLRA unit. Each NRI record is keyed to the soil interpretation record (SOILS) data base so that soil attributes relevant to wetlands function are available for each of the 300,000 NRI sample points.
These maps are relatively new and have not been tested extensively against wetlands field data.
Both map types are the only currently available maps from which the landscape-level water purification and flood control functions of wetlands might be inferred for all areas of the United States.
The scale/resolution of the maps is inappropriate for most planning purposes at the local level. Also, these maps cannot be used to infer the functions of an individual wetland. Inferences of wetlands functions at the landscape level would be based on hydric soils, but not all hydric soils are wetlands. In the case of the STATSGO data, the soil mapping units do not necessarily coincide with physical boundaries that are relevant to defining landscape functional units (watersheds). This could lead to some imprecision in estimates compiled on that basis. The generation and compilation of thematic maps from STATSGO and NATSGO maps requires a mainframe computer with adequate storage, advanced data base management and GIS software and a skilled computer technician.
Maps are available from: National Cartographic Center, USDA Soil Conservation Service, Fort Worth, Texas.
(4)
Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Swampbuster Maps. These maps are mostly at a scale of 1:12,000 or 1:20,000 and primarily cover cropland and areas closely associated with cropland.
Most maps were completed since 1987 and largely represent a one-time assessment; about five percent may be reassessed annually.
Wetland boundaries were hand drawn on recent aerial photographs. The delineations were based on an overlay of hydric soils maps; hydrophytic vegetation and presence of surface water (as visible from aerial photographs from multiple years); and, in some cases, field checking to confirm wetlands status.
These maps probably represent the most extensive, detailed and up-to-date map source for wetlands in certain areas. However, because these maps are relatively new, they are not widely used because of limited distribution.
These maps are not for sale but can be viewed at state SCS offices.
The strength of these maps is that they are a useful complement to NWI maps because they include many of the wetlands that NWI misses, specifically, cropped and very small wetlands.
The limitation of these maps is that because wetland boundaries were drawn on aerial photographs not printed for mass distribution, the maps are difficult to access and compile and they often do not include prior converted wetlands.
(5)
FEMA Flood Hazard Maps. The scale varies depending on the locality and ranges from one inch equals 2,000 feet to one inch equals 200 feet.
Maps show floodplains of 100- and 500-year storm events based on analyses conducted since 1968. Floodplains were delineated from topographic maps, stream flow data, channel cross-sectional measurements and aerial photographs supplemented with limited hydraulic modeling and ground-checking.
These maps are not extensively used to identify wetlands.
The strength of these maps is that they might be used to help identify dominant water sources and transport vectors for specific wetlands located near rivers. They also might be used to identify wetlands that, if they store floodwater, are likely to have greater value because they help protect downstream properties that otherwise are likely to be flooded.
Limitations are that FEMA maps are not available for all jurisdictions. The 100- and 500-year floodplains do not have any particular ecological or geomorphic significance (annual, two-year and five-year floodplains are probably more functionally important) and their correlation with wetlands or hydric soil extent or function is unknown. Their accuracy may be reduced in areas with very wide, flat floodplains and backwater flooding. Boundaries may be outdated on maps of communities that have experienced rapid development since mapping.
Maps are available through:
Flood Map Distribution Center, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Baltimore, MD.
(6)
USGS Land-Use Land Analysis Maps (LUDA). Most LUDA maps are at a scale of 1:250,000; some are at 1:100,000. The minimum map unit size for the former is generally 40 acres (ten acres for open water).
These maps are based on interpretation of aerial photographs at a scale of 1:62,500 and recognize only two types of wetlands: forested and non-forested wetlands. Additionally, each map represents only one time period, ranging from the late 1960s to the present.
The maps are seldom used in identifying wetlands.
The strengths of these maps are that they are the only source of digital wetlands data for nearly the entire United States and the only map data source that includes all landscape components, not just wetlands. This allows for better integration of wetlands data with other landscape data when interpreting the role of wetlands in the landscape.
The limitation of these maps is that wetlands are grossly underestimated, because the minimum map unit size is too coarse and also because a consistent, modern definition of wetlands was not used during the mapping. In particular, forested, cropped and aquatic bed wetlands appear to be ignored or severely underestimated.
Maps are available from: Earth Science Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia.
(7)
Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Landcover Maps. These maps show 15 types of land use, including seven wetland classes, and have been produced at a scale of 1:24,000. They are not available for general distribution, but are on file at RDC offices.
Digital versions of the landcover data are available from:
USGS Center for Spatial Analysis Technologies, Georgia Institute of Technology Research Institute, Baker Building, Atlanta, Georgia 30332. This information is derived from automated classification of Landsat satellite imagery. As with NWI maps, they cannot be used to determine jurisdictional wetlands as regulated by the Army Corps of Engineers. Although a useful complement to NWI maps, they were produced at an accuracy of 85 percent and have not been thoroughly field checked.

ARTICLE III. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHEDS

Sec. 106-58. - Purpose.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering waters resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(b)
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city.
(Code 1996, § 42-131; Ord. No. 01-03-22C, § I, 3-22-2001; Ord. No. 01-05-14-5, § I, 5-14-2001)
Sec. 106-59. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed.
Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in section 106-61.
Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios.
Large water supply watershed means a watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake.
Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a USGS quad map.
Reservoir boundary means the edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level.

ARTICLE IV. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS PROTECTION

Sec. 106-85. - Purpose.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water.
(b)
Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(Code 1996, § 42-151; Ord. No. 01-03-22A, § I, 3-22-2001)
Sec. 106-86. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600-2-87-035. (Note: The DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility.)
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using the DRASTIC methodology (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia).
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).
