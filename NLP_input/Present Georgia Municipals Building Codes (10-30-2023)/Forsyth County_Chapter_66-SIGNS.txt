DIVISION 1. - FINDINGS AND OBJECTIVES; GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 66-31. - Findings on the public health, safety, and welfare rationales of sign regulations.
Building code requirements address many public concerns about dangerous signs. Appendix H of the 2012 International Building Code is supposed to ensure that they will not pose a fire hazard and are appropriately anchored or secured so that they do not fall or blow down. However, Appendix H does not regulate the location of signs, except to prevent them from interfering with an entryway, opening required for ventilation, or fire escape (International Building Code. 0121994. Appendix H, Section H103.1, Location Restrictions).
Sign regulations achieve public safety rationales not achieved by the standard building code. Without a sign ordinance, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has long been recognized that signage controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. A 1980 Federal Highway Administration study found a positive correlation between billboards and accident rates (Scenic America. Fact Sheet (1): Billboard Control: Fighting Visual Pollution, http://www.scenic.org/factl.htm.).
Signs too close to the road can cause accidents. Without additional regulation, signs can be placed dangerously close to rights-of-ways in locations where they might be struck by an oncoming vehicle using the road or having to veer off the road.
Signs can impair visibility. The placement of signs can interfere with the sight of motorists trying to exit a driveway onto a public road. Traffic safety is improved by restricting the size, height, and spacing of signs.
Signs distract motorists. By their very nature, signs are designed to direct attention to something and distract motorists to view a message or turn off the roadway and into a property to frequent a business, place, or activity. To the extent that signage captures the sight and attention of a motorist, it distracts motorists from the primary purpose of safely maneuvering a vehicle along the road.
Signs can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs. Motorists might confuse signs that contain flashing or blinking red, green, or yellow lights (such as a lighted portable sign adjacent to the road) with roadway traffic signals, emergency vehicles, or other hazards. Signs constructed of shapes like an octagonal "stop" sign might also impair public safety by confusing the motorist.
Limitations on window signs can increase visibility from the public right-of-way and thus deter crime and robberies. Sign controls that limit the amount of storefront window and door areas that can be covered with signs enhance visibility of activities within the store or building. Limits on window signs can provide for an appropriate minimum of exterior visibility and thus increase public safety of commercial areas through a reduction in crime potential.
Signs can degrade property values. A principal purpose of land use regulations, including sign controls, is to protect and preserve property values. There is no question that signs affect the character of districts and the value of buildings, or that they are not appropriate in different parts of a community.
The size, height, materials of construction, location, condition, and attributes of signs can have an impact on surrounding and nearby land uses. For instance, if signs were unregulated, large, tall signs could be erected in the county's single family residential districts. Such signs, if erected, would be out of character with residential neighborhoods and could result in the lowering of property values for residential use. As another example, blighted signs and antiquated signs and sign structures (i.e., the pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can contribute to an overall image of blight and a reduction of property values in declining areas, if not addressed and removed via sign controls. Forsyth County's sign regulations are needed to ensure that signage is compatible with its surroundings and does not take away from the character of particular districts.
Unregulated signage can degrade the utility of public safety signs. In some places, unregulated signs can reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public due to competition with other signs and the resulting reduction in visibility of public purpose signs.
All other advertising mediums are regulated, so why not unavoidable impacts of advertising signs? The Federal Communications Commission regulates our air waves and television stations and the content that passes through them. Aside from the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, there is little if any federal involvement in the regulation of signs. This lack of federal regulation is interesting in the sense that signs are one of the most obtrusive forms of advertising. Signage is probably the only type of advertising that cannot be turned off or rejected by the consumer. Radio advertisements can be avoided by turning off the radio. The same is true with television advertisements; we flip channels or take a break when television commercials come on. Junk mail can be thrown away. We quickly flip past the advertisements in our favorite magazine when we are disinterested. Phone solicitations can be avoided with "caller identification" or terminating the conversation. The same cannot be said of outdoor advertising structures and commercial signs. One's vision of signage cannot be turned off. We are captivated by signage when we drive down the road. How do you avoid signs? We must keep our eyes open to drive and cannot block out signs from our peripheral vision. Perhaps one could take an alternative route that is not developed with signs, but that is not always feasible. Absent federal and significant state regulation, it is in the public interest for cities and counties to control signage.
Signs derive their value from public improvements. Businesses locate, and signs are constructed, because of the access the community provides to business locations. It is precisely these types of advertising that are the principal target of local sign regulation - the signs controlled locally are those which are visible from public ways. It is the public way that creates the value for the person erecting the sign, and visibility from the public way is what creates the problems which give rise to the need for sign controls. This is a sound rationale for sign regulation. It logically follows that, because the public way provides value, the public therefore has a right, and indeed an obligation, to control the problems that arise from creating that value.
Unregulated signs adversely impact public investments. Sign regulation helps to assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets and other public structures and spaces are protected. Unregulated signs have the potential to negate those public investments, as well.
(Ord. No. 74-O, § 1.1, 3-5-2015; Ord. No. 74-T, § 1, 7-14-2017)
Sec. 66-32. - Findings on the business interest rationales of sign regulations.
Sign regulation is in the interest of businesses. One often overlooked justification for the regulation of signs is that sign regulations benefit those businesses that seek to advertise. Unregulated competition among business results in too many signs and can reach a point of diminishing returns where individual business signs are not adequately visible. Patrons of individual businesses located along the unregulated commercial strip may miss their destination because they cannot find the particular business in the sea of signage. The unregulated commercial strip signage also can work to the detriment of individual businesses in that they are forced to erect larger and more costly signs to outdo their neighboring businesses and competitors. Therefore, sign regulations benefit individual business owners.
The lack of sign controls causes uncertainty among prospective business owners. Forsyth County's sign ordinance provides prospective businesses with guidance on how much signage they may have, where it is allowed to be located and what types of signs are permitted. Without sign controls, business owners lack such guidance. Such a situation could have detrimental impacts on businesses, either through inequitable treatment or a delay in the time involved in the permitting of signs. Such potential detrimental impacts would not exist or would be mitigated with a clear set of sign regulations.
(Ord. No. 74-O, § 1.2, 3-5-2015)
Sec. 66-33. - Findings on the aesthetic rationales of sign regulations.
There are many reasons to justify the county's sign ordinance. However, among the most relevant reasons are to promote and ensure the aesthetics of the community. In the earliest days of sign regulations, relying on aesthetics as a rationale could not legally justify local sign controls. The United States Supreme Court began a slow transformation, from its previous position that aesthetics alone could not justify land use regulations, to a position that aesthetic considerations were legitimately within the scope of police power. In 1954, Justice Douglas of the high court found the following: The concept of public welfare is broad and inclusive. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. It is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well balanced as well as carefully controlled (Berman v Parker 348 U.S. 26, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 1954).
Sign regulations help communities maintain their scenic heritage and unique character. Without Forsyth County's brand of sign regulation its commercial areas will likely end up looking like any other place. Signs can interfere with scenic views. The appearance of the community, which is substantially influenced by signs, is essential to the county's long-term economic viability and helps determine how residents and visitors alike perceive it. Sign control is an integral part of improving visual character and quality of life.
(Ord. No. 74-O, § 1.3, 3-5-2015)
Sec. 66-34. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article include but are not limited to the following:
(a)
Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of signs and similar devices.
(b)
Permit the reasonable dissemination of all forms of speech.
(c)
To guard against an excess of large, ugly, intense signs which cause visual blight on the appearance of the county. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the county for residents, businesses, pedestrians, and persons in vehicles.
(d)
Protect the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification.
(e)
Promote economic development.
(f)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs.
(g)
Insure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community.
(h)
Encourage signs that are well designed and compatible with their surroundings and with the buildings to which they are appurtenant, and encourage signs that are integrated with and harmonious to the buildings and sites they occupy.
(i)
Eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays.
(j)
Recognize that the size of signs that provide adequate identification in pedestrian-oriented business areas differs from those that are necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where traffic is heavy, travel speeds are greater, and required setbacks are greater than in pedestrian areas.
(k)
Preserve and improve the appearance of the county as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade.
(l)
Encourage creative and well-designed signs that contribute in a positive way to the county's visual environment, express local character, and help develop a distinctive image for the county, and to discourage mediocre and poorly designed signs.
(m)
Encourage new and replacement signage that is appropriately sized in its context so as to be easily readable.
(n)
Encourage the construction, alteration, and repair of signs according to accepted and approved standards.
(o)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(p)
Further the objectives of the county's comprehensive plan and the Unified Development Code.
