_____
Sec. 82-46. - Base and pavement specifications.
(a)
Minimum construction standards are as follows (Standard Details 401 through 403):
EXPAND
Street Category Subgrade Base Binder Topping
Local (residential subdivision) Upper 12 inches of Subgrade compacted to at least 100% standard Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-99) 8 inches Compacted Graded Aggregate Base (Group 1 Aggregate), 98% modified Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-180) 2 inchesAsphaltic concrete 19mm Superpave 2 inches Asphaltic concrete 9.5mm Superpave, or 12.5 mm Superpave
Minor collector (commercial) Upper 12 inches of Subgrade compacted to At least 100% standard Proctor maximum dry Density (AASHTO T-99) 8 inches Compacted Graded Aggregate Base (Group 1 Aggregate), 98% modified Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-180) 2.5 inches Asphaltic concrete 19 mm Superpave 2 inches Asphaltic concrete 12.5 mm Superpave
Major collector (industrial) Upper 12 inches of Subgrade compacted to at least 100% standard Proctor maximum dry Density (AASHTO T-99) 12 inches Compacted Graded Aggregate Base (Group 1 Aggregate), 98% modified Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-180) 4 inches Asphaltic concrete 19 mm Superpave 2 inches Asphaltic concrete 12 mm Superpave
  (1)
The structural number and allowable equivalent single axle load repetitions (ESALs) for the revised pavement sections are similar to those derived from the current standard sections. We believe that by limiting the thickness of graded aggregate base (GAB) to six inches for the minor collector and residential standard sections, construction efficiency will increase and costs may decrease since the GAB could be installed in one layer instead of two, as would be required for any GAB layers thicker than eight inches. Subgrade preparation requirements, GAB compaction requirements, and specified pavement types are in accordance with Georgia DOT standards.
(2)
In general, all pavement construction should be in accordance with Georgia DOT specifications. Proper subgrade compaction, adherence to Georgia DOT specifications, and compliance with project plans and specifications will be critical to the performance of the constructed pavement.
(3)
For major collectors, engineers can submit alternate pavement designs for city review and consideration.
(b)
Concrete pavement alternatives. The following are concrete pavement alternatives for minor collector roads and major collector roads:
EXPAND
Street category Subgrade Base Concrete
Minor collector (commercial) Upper 12 inches of subgrade compacted to at least 100% standard Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-99) 8 inches Compacted Graded Aggregate Base (Group I Aggregate), 98% modified Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-180) 7 inches
Major collector (industrial) Upper 12 inches of subgrade compacted to at least 100% standard Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-99) 12 inches Compacted Graded Aggregate Base (Group I Aggregate), 98% modified Proctor maximum dry density (AASHTO T-180) 9 inches
  (1)
The structural number and single axle load repetitions (ESALs) for the concrete pavement sections are similar to those derived from the current standards asphaltic concrete sections.
(2)
A 650-psi flexural strength concrete mix should be used. This corresponds to a compressive strength of approximately 4,500 psi. Portland cement concrete pavement should contain four to six percent entrained air, assuming the mix will contain three-fourths- to one-inch nominal maximum size aggregate. Concrete slump should be no more than four inches.
(3)
Construction joints and other design details should be in accordance with guidelines provided by the Portland Cement Association and the American Concrete Institute. In general, all pavement construction should be in accordance with Georgia DOT specifications. Proper subgrade compaction, adherence to Georgia DOT specifications, and compliance with project plans and specifications will be critical to the performance of the constructed pavement.
(c)
Pavement design verification (for example only). The pavement design verification for the one-half-mile access road is based on the following information and assumptions:
(1)
Design life: Approximately 20 years.
(2)
Traffic: 600 vehicles per day (With assumed HS20 loaded tractor-trailers, 300 per lane).
(3)
Initial serviceability: 4.2 (AASHTO).
(4)
Terminal serviceability (Ri): 2.5 (GDOT Pavement Design Manual).
(5)
Soil resilient modulus (MR) 5,800 (assuming properly prepared subgrade and a CBR of 5).
(6)
Regional factor: 2.0 (GDOT) Pavement Design Manual).
(7)
Total equivalent single axle loads: 5,235,000 (based on estimated traffic).

Sec. 82-47. - Development, testing and inspection requirements.
(a)
Testing and inspection of site improvements shall be in accordance with the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) Standard Specifications Construction of Roads and Bridges, 1993 edition, or subsequent revisions. An inspection fee of $300.00 is required before construction begins.
(b)
The following sections of the Georgia DOT Standard Specifications are frequently referenced when working with city street development: section 201 through section 221 (Earthwork), section 222 through section 328 (Bases and Subbases), section 400 through section 461 (Pavements), section 544 through section 577 (Minor Drainage Structures), section 800 through section 934 (Materials).
(c)
The city street inspector shall be advised before each major improvement is undertaken. Clearing, grubbing, subgrade preparation, storm drainage, basing, paving, curb and gutter are considered major improvements.
(d)
The street inspector shall cause to be made as many tests as necessary to determine that DOT Standard Specifications are being met throughout the development of streets. Any and all testing expenses shall be the responsibility of the developer. Proof roll tests are required with loaded tandem dump truck provided by the contractor for subgrade, curb base, and final base prior to paving. Inspections shall be conducted for each phase of paving, curb/gutter, sidewalks, right-of-way grassing, signs, striping and street lights. [Inspections may be scheduled by] calling 706-602-6027, 24 hours in advance for each inspection. Failure to call for inspections could result in compaction tests being required at developers' expense.
