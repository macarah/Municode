Sec. 58-1. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article include but are not limited to the following:
(1)
Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business or express their thoughts and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of signs and advertising devices.
(2)
Guard against an excess of large, aesthetically unappealing, intense signs which cause visual blight on the appearance of the community. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the community for residents, businesses, pedestrians, and persons in vehicles.
(3)
Protect the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification.
(4)
Provide regulations that vary the sign area based on the type of land use, and based on need which is determined in part by the type of road frontage to which signage is directed.
(5)
Provide regulations which are content-neutral. It is not the intent to regulate the content of messages in any way. To accomplish this, these regulations do not distinguish between on-site or off-site sign content, nor do they distinguish between commercial and noncommercial content. Any sign permitted pursuant to this article may contain commercial or non-commercial content. Sign allowances in this article take into account the needs for off-premise signs and signs carrying messages of a noncommercial character.
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs.
(7)
Insure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community.
(8)
Eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays.
(9)
Preserve and improve the appearance of the community as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade.

For double-faced signs, only the largest display face shall be measured in computing the sign area, or only one face shall be measured in computing sign area if the display faces are the same size.
