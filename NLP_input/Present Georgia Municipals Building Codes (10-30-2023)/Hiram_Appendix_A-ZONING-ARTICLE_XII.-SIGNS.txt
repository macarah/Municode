Sec. A. - Short title.
This article shall hereafter be known and cited as the "City of Hiram Sign Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 2017-1(Exh. A), 1-10-2017)
Sec. B. - Purpose and findings.
(1)
Purpose. This Article was enacted with the following purposes:
(a)
To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs;
(b)
To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
(c)
To promote economic, development;
(d)
To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs;
(e)
To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and aesthetic environment of the City;
(f)
To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards;
(g)
To provide an easier, quicker and more economically efficient way to apply for a sign review application; and
(h)
To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2)
Findings.
(a)
The City finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of their idea or identification of their premises.
(b)
Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs throughout the City is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the City, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citizens of the City.
(c)
The City further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by a public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Virtually all signs erected by public authority are for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings or facilities, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The City finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a proprietary purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
(d)
The City finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
(e)
In considering the appropriate level of sign regulation for the City, the City has considered planning studies, reports, news articles, town hall meetings with business owners, sign vendors and related information from a variety of sources. In this ordinance the City strives to balance the variety of interests impacted by signage and potential regulation. The City finds that the specifics of regulation satisfy the legal requirements for sign regulation and balance the various interests of all who are impacted by sign regulation. The materials accompanying adoption of this ordinance attest to the significance and compelling nature of the City's interests as do numerous judicial decisions. While regulating signs, however, the City has been mindful and careful to afford ample methods and alternatives to communicate both commercial and non-commercial messages.
(f)
The City finds that advances in technology utilizing LED components results in signs brighter in appearance for LED signs than for signs not utilizing LED technology. While exact measurements have not been determined, some of the explanation for the additional brightness by LED signs is that the field of light projection is diametrically opposed to that of standard billboards. Standard billboard lighting, whether ground mounted or platform mounted, is directed at the billboard itself, leaving very little light emission elsewhere; whereas, the LED sign faces the road system providing a brighter, more readable sign. Studies, particularly during non-daylight hours, demonstrate that attention given by drivers to such signs is longer than attention given to non-LED signs. These studies and their conclusions have been compiled and are presented in Compendium of Recent Research Studies on Distraction from Commercial Electronic Variable Message Signs prepared by the Veridian Group in February 2016 discussing a variety of studies conducted since 2008. As a result of these and other studies pertaining to billboard research and information, the City has determined that use of LED technology on outdoor signage in the City requires unique regulation as a result of potential driver distractions and competing traffic interferences. Regulations developed in this chapter are designed to find an appropriate balance between allowance of such new technologies and protection of the public interest.

Sec. L. - General regulations.
Unless a stricter regulation is provided for elsewhere in this Article, all signs throughout the City shall be subject to the following:
(1)
Computation of Sign Area.
(a)
The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight (8) straight lines with intersecting angles of only 90 degrees enclosing the limits of a sign face together with any materials or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets other City regulations and is clearly incidental to the sign itself. The method of computation of sign area is illustrated below:
(b)
If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within twenty-four (24) inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon.
(c)
For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are back to back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is forty-five (45) degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the areas on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle.
(2)
Computation of Sign Height. Except where prescribed otherwise in this Article, the height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the highest point of the sign structure. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street immediately adjacent to the parcel where the sign is to be located or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the nearest point of the crown of a public street immediately adjacent to the parcel where the sign is to be located, the sign height shall be measured as if situated level with the crown of such public street.
(3)
Sign Location.
(a)
No sign shall be erected, relocated, or maintained so as to prevent free ingress or egress from any door, window, or fire escape.
(b)
No sign or any part thereof, except authorized public signs, shall be located in any public right-of-way or on public property.
(c)
No sign may be located any closer than fifteen (15) feet to an intersection of two (2) public roadways as measured from the nearest point of intersection of the two (2) rights-of-way.
(d)
Unless a more restrictive setback is specified elsewhere in this Article, in a zoning overlay district, or in the conditions of zoning, all signs and all parts of signs shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from the right-of-way, or twenty (20) feet from the edge of pavement if a private street, and no sign shall project over the right-of-way or a private street.
(4)
Changeable Copy Signs.
(a)
Changeable copy shall be permitted only as a part of monument signs, menu signs, and wall signs.
(b)
Changeable copy signs shall not flash or scroll or be animated in any manner but, rather, and shall remain constant in lighting, color, and all other changeable variables allowed by technology.
(c)
If the changeable copy sign consists of or contains as a component an electronic message board, the electronic message board must contain a default mechanism that freezes the sign face display if a malfunction occurs.
(d)
The changeable copy portion of a sign shall not exceed 50% of the overall sign area, or thirty-two (32) square feet, whichever is less.
(e)
Changeable copy signs may not change more than once per minute.
(5)
Construction Standards.

Sec. N. - Penalties for violation of provisions.
(1)
If any sign or aspect of a sign that is regulated by this Article is installed, created, constructed, altered, converted, maintained, or used in violation of any provision of this Article, then the City Manager or his designee shall provide written notice to the permittee of the violation. Similar notice of a violation shall be provided to the owner of the property upon which the sign is located if the sign is one that was not and has not been permitted by the City and that otherwise does not exist lawfully. The notice shall provide a period not to exceed thirty (30) days within which to correct or remove the sign or otherwise bring the sign into compliance with applicable provisions of this Article.
(a)
If the violation is not corrected within the time provided, then the City Manager or his designee shall issue a written citation to the permittee or property owner (if the sign is one that was not and has not been permitted by the City and that otherwise does not exist lawfully) and the matter shall be placed on the docket for hearing by the City's Municipal Court.
(2)
A person determined to have violated any provision of this Article shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of up to $1,000.00 for each demonstrated daily violation of the provision, by imprisonment not to exceed sixty (60) days, or any combination of both. The foregoing shall be in addition to any and all other remedies available to the City, including, but not limited to, revocation of a permit as well as removal of the sign. The City may seek affirmative relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to cause the removal of a sign not brought into compliance with the provisions of this Article. Appeals of any decisions or orders of the City's Municipal Court shall be taken by filing a petition for a writ of certiorari as provided by O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1 et seq.
(3)
If it is determined by the City Manager or his designee that a sign poses a reasonable threat of danger to public safety, written notice of such threat to public safety shall be provided immediately to the sign or building owner and/or the beneficial user of the sign, providing no more than five (5) days' notice within which to alleviate and remedy the threat to public safety in compliance with all applicable regulations and will state that if such corrective and remedial action is not taken that the sign shall be removed by the City as provided for herein.
(a)
If the threat of danger is not so alleviated and remedied within five (5) days' written notice, the City shall initiate efforts that in its reasonable judgment alleviates and/or remedies the threat to public safety which may entail removal of the sign. If the threat poses an imminent danger to the public that the City reasonably determines to require immediate action to alleviate and remedy the danger, the advance written notice described in this section shall be required, but the City is permitted to undertake reasonable action to alleviate and remedy the threat. The threat and its immediacy shall be documented and notice of the action and the reasons for shall be provided as soon as practicable to the sign or building owner and/or the beneficial user of the sign. Such City-initiated alleviation and remedy may include, but is not limited to, removal of the sign. In all instances where the City undertakes to alleviate or remedy such a threat, the costs of those efforts, including the costs of any removal of a sign and all incidental expenses and costs incurred in connection with removal, shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectable in the same manner as any City property taxes.
(4)
Any sign removed by the City or his designee pursuant to the provisions in this Section shall become the property of the City and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the City. If it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived from removal of a sign, the City may sell the same at a private or public sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are less than the costs and expenses incurred in removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectable in the same manner as any City property taxes.
(Ord. No. 2017-1(Exh. A), 1-10-2017)
Sec. O. - Variances.
(1)
An application for a variance from the strict application of the provisions of this Article may be initiated by submitting a completed variance application to the City Manager on the form provided by the City Manager's office and paying the application fee, as shall be set from time to time by resolution of the Governing Authority. The applicant for variance shall be placed on a council agenda no less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of application and payment of the required application fee. Notice of all variance applications shall be made in the same manner as notice of zoning variances. The Governing Authority shall render a final decision on all variance applications within thirty (30) days of hearing the matter. Any applicant for whom variance is denied may petition for writ of certiorari from the Governing Authority's decision to superior court.
(2)
Variances from the regulations of this chapter shall be limited to the following hardship situations:
(a)
The topography of the lot on which the sign is located or to be located renders it impossible to comport with the applicable standards of this Article.
(b)
The natural features of the lot on which the sign is located or to be located, or of the land immediately adjacent to the lot, impairs the visibility of the sign such that it cannot be seen.
(3)
Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship.
(4)
No variance shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs than would be allowed if the hardship did not exist.
(5)
No variance shall be available or granted from any hardship that is self-induced or the result of the man-made alteration of the topography and natural features.
(Ord. No. 2017-1(Exh. A), 1-10-2017)
Sec. P. - Non-conforming signs.
(1)
Nonconforming signs may stay in place until one of the following conditions occurs:
(a)
The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard or renders it dilapidated, unsightly, or unkempt; or
(b)
The sign has been damaged to such extent that more than minor repairs or a material change is required to restore the sign, provided that such damage was not the result of act of God or by other circumstances beyond control of owner of sign.
(2)
A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards, or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted provided that said replacement does not constitute a material change to the sign. All nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good repair.
(3)
Ordinary repair and maintenance such as electrical or lettering repairs is permitted; provided however, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of a nonconforming sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the standards of this Article. "Refacing" of a sign face (defined as removal followed immediately by installation of a sign face of the same size, style, font, and configuration as that existing immediately thereto) shall be treated as ordinary repair and maintenance.
(a)
To the extent any permits or permissions are required for any ordinary repair and maintenance to be undertaken, such shall be obtained prior to undertaking the repair and maintenance. A failure to do so voids and eliminates any nonconforming status otherwise attaching to the sign and requires that the sign be brought into compliance with the provisions of this Article.
(4)
To the extent that a nonconforming sign allowable hereunder is damaged or destroyed by an act of God, then such sign may be repaired or restored to its condition and configuration existing immediately prior to the damage or destruction, provided such is accomplished within sixty (60) days of the event resulting in the damage or destruction.
(5)
A nonconforming wall sign may be removed and reinstalled by the permittee or sign owner as a part of a building renovation or revitalization project so long as the permittee provides the City Manager with photographs detailing the dimensions of the existing wall signs prior to removal and no alterations, modifications, or changes of any kind are made to the wall signs upon reinstallation, unless it is to bring it into conformance with the requirements of this Article. Any wall sign removed without prior identification from the City Manager as a legal nonconforming wall sign will be subject to all of the sign standards established in this Article upon reinstallation.
(Ord. No. 2017-1(Exh. A), 1-10-2017)
Sec. Q. - Conflicts with zoning overlay districts.
To the extent that any regulations governing any zoning overlay district now existing or later enacted conflict with this Article, the most restrictive provisions shall control.
(Ord. No. 2017-1(Exh. A), 1-10-2017)
Sec. R. - Severability.
Should any article, section, clause, or provision of this Article be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such action shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any part hereof other than the part so declared to be invalid, it being the intent of the Governing Authority that each article, section, clause, and provision hereof be severable.
(Ord. No. 2017-1(Exh. A), 1-10-2017)
