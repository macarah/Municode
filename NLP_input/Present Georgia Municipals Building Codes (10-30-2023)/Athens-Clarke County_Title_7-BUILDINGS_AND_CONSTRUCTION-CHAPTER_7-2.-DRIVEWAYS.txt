Editor's note— Ord. of 7-7-2009, § 1, deleted the former Ch. 7-2, §§ 7-2-1—7-2-5, and enacted a new Ch. 7-2 as set out herein. The former Ch. 7-2 pertained to driveways and derived from Ord. of 11-11-91 §§ 1—5; Ord. of 4-7-92 §§ 1, 2; Ord. of 6-1-93, § 1; Ord. of 7-2-96, § 1; Ord. of 7-6-99, § 1.

Sec. 7-2-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure safe and efficient vehicular access to or from the public street system to or from private property, to protect the capacity for handling peak traffic volumes of public streets, to maintain smooth traffic flow, and to maintain street and right-of-way drainage. This chapter has been established to meet the following objectives:
(1)
To provide maximum safety and protection to the public through the regulation of vehicles entering and exiting public streets;
(2)
To provide a uniform ordinance for the design, location, operation and construction of driveways throughout Athens-Clarke County; and
(3)
To provide owners of abutting property with the maximum service feasible, consistent with the safe and efficient use of the public streets.
(Ord. of 7-7-2009, § 1)

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the definitions set out below:
Clear Sight Triangle: An area of unobstructed vision at street intersections (including alleys) or street and driveway intersections defined by lines of sight between points at a given distance from the intersection of street and/or driveway lines.
Culvert: Closed conduit used for the passage of surface drainage under the driveway(s).
Curb and gutter: Two primary styles of curb and gutter exist in Athens-Clarke County:
(1)
Vertical curb and gutter-Generally 2.5 feet wide, with face of curb being two feet from edge of pavement and six inches high;

Driveway angle: The angle between the driveway centerline and the edge of the roadway.
Driveway width: The narrowest distance of the driveway running parallel with the edge of pavement.
Frontage: That distance measured along the right-of-way line between successive side property lines.
Point of tangency: That point where the driveway radius and the roadway meet.
Radius: That radius corresponding to a circular design pattern, which will allow for vehicle clearance when entering or leaving a driveway.
Right-of-way: That property owned by the governmental body on which the roadway system exists and which may be accessed with the construction of driveways.
Roadway capacity: Maximum rate at which vehicles can reasonably cross a given point on a roadway during a given time under prevailing roadway, traffic and control conditions.

e.
For non-single family residential properties, any additional structural or site improvement square footage added to an existing structure or site improvement that is greater than ten percent of the existing building square footage for structural improvements or ten percent of the existing site improvement square footage for site improvements.

Application for a driveway permit should be made at the Athens-Clarke County Transportation and Public Works Department Office. Application shall be made prior to any on-site construction. The application must be accompanied by a scaled drawing showing the following:
(1)
Length, width and radius of all curves of the driveway;
(2)
The relationship (distance and angle) of the driveway to property lines, structures and existing private roads and public highways;
(3)
Location and size of any culverts;
(4)
Slope of the driveway;
(5)
Topography of the immediate area of the proposed driveway location;
(6)
Location and structure of any retaining walls in the immediate vicinity of the proposed driveway; and
(7)
Cross-section of the driveway.
(b)
No permits for building construction or site work, including grading and paving, shall be issued until a site plan meeting the requirements of this Chapter has been approved by the Director of Transportation and Public Works or designee.
(Ord. of 7-7-2009, § 1)
Sec. 7-2-7. - General design requirements.
(a)
The design and construction of driveways situated within the Athens-Clarke County right-of-way (ROW) shall conform to the design standards contained in the Athens-Clarke County Department of Transportation and Public Works Technical Standards Manual.
(b)
Access points to the property shall be limited based on the adjacent public roadway's functional classification as identified in the MACORTS 2030 Long Range Transportation Plan and are as follows:
(1)
Distance between driveways:
On Urban Principal and Minor Arterial streets - 150 feet
On Urban Collector streets - 100 feet
On all other streets - 50 feet
For single family homes in RS-5 and RS-8 zoning designations, the spacing requirements between driveways may be as close as ten feet in one direction as long as there is at least 50 feet of separation between driveways in the other direction.
(2)
Distance from intersection:
On Urban Principal and Minor Arterial streets - 150 feet
On Urban Collector streets - 100 feet
On all other streets - 50 feet
A request for driveway spacing less than that defined above may be considered by the Director of Transportation and Public Works if safety is not impacted. The process for this request is identified in section 7-2-10.
(c)
The driveway shall be located and its dimensions restricted so that the entire design is contained within the property to be served, unless it is a shared driveway.
(d)
The minimum distance from the side property line that a driveway may be located is five feet, unless it is a shared access drive with the adjoining property. This distance is measured from the side property line or property line extension, along the edge of pavement to the beginning of the driveway point of tangency or taper.
(e)
When property is a corner lot, the driveway shall not provide direct access into the intersection, but shall be located away from the intersection, as set forth in subsection (b) above.
(f)
Driveways shall not encroach upon areas of rights-of-way deemed necessary for effective traffic control, highway signs or signals.
(g)
The number of driveways permitted to access a property is defined in Table 1 of this chapter and shall not vary unless the Traffic Engineer deems it necessary that the number allowed be altered while providing reasonable service to the property without jeopardizing safety, convenience and maintenance of the highway.
(h)
Design requirements for urban driveways shall apply when the adjacent roadway is characterized by the provision of curb and gutter for the passage of surface drainage.
(i)
Design requirements for rural driveways shall apply when the roadway is characterized by the provision of ditches and culverts for the passage of surface drainage. In these cases, the driveway apron may be constructed of either concrete or asphalt materials.
(j)
When, in the judgment of the Traffic Engineer, it is necessary for safety purposes, a driveway may be deemed as only an entrance or exit.
(k)
No landscaping, fences, terraces or other natural or artificial features adjacent to any street shall be of a nature impairing visibility from or of approaching vehicular traffic where such visibility is important to safety nor shall such features in any way create potential hazards to pedestrians.
(l)
A driveway shall be located and designed such that adequate sight distance is allowed in either direction. At all driveways a clear sight triangle shall be enforced on both sides of the driveway to prevent off-street parking, landscaping or other material obstructions from blocking the driver's view. The dimensions of this clear sight triangular area to be maintained for each side of the driveway shall be 35 feet by 25 feet and defined as: 35 feet along the property line from the intersecting point of the driveway centerline and the right-of-way or property line, and 25 feet along the driveway centerline from the intersecting point of the driveway centerline and the right-of-way or property line towards the interior of the property. In addition, at all intersections a clear sight triangle shall be enforced on the property frontage along the roadway based on specific site conditions including right-of-way widths, pavement widths and topography. Further information on this subject is contained in the Athens-Clarke County Department of Transportation and Public Works Technical Standards Manual. The Transportation and Public Works Director or their designee shall have the authority to adjust these distances if in their opinion such action is necessary for the protection of traffic and/or the basis of site conditions.
(m)
On roadways maintained by the Unified Government, the need for the applicant to provide dedicated right-turn and/or left-turn lanes will follow the standards contained in the Georgia Department of Transportation's (GDOT) Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control Manual (Driveway Manual).
