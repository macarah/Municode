Sec. 5-295. - Purpose and applicability.
new
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to:
(1)
Encourage the conservation of natural resources through the use of native plants and maintenance techniques as recommended by the American National Standards Institute (A300).
(2)
Preserve and/or replace non-native trees and vegetation as part of the land development and building construction process.
(3)
Improve the appearance of all land uses in ways that improve and enhance the health of the natural environment;
(4)
Maintain permeable land areas essential to stormwater management and groundwater recharge;
(5)
Promote energy conservation through the creation of shade, thereby reducing heat retention in or on buildings or paved areas;
(6)
Protecting canopy and specimen trees as defined in this article.
(b)
Applicability. This section shall apply to all land development and construction activities taking place in all zoning districts, with the exception of special districts as defined elsewhere in the Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. No. 2022-06 , § 3, 1-12-22)
Sec. 5-296. - Definitions.
new
For the purpose of this section, certain words and terms used herein shall be defined and shall have their customary dictionary definition.
Invasive species means any species, including its seeds, spores or other biological material capable of propagating that species, that is not native to that ecosystem; and whose introduction does or is likely to cause environmental harm. Political boundaries are not used when determining a species nativity. Instead a species is defined as being exotic when it is not native to a particular ecosystem, making it possible to have a species that is native to parts of Georgia, but considered invasive in others.
Native species means any species, including trees, bushes, shrubs, grasses, and other plant material that is indigenous to that ecosystem, and whose introduction or reintroduction is not likely to cause environmental harm.
(Ord. No. 2022-06 , § 3, 1-12-22)
Sec. 5-297. - Native trees and plants required.
new
(a)
Unless otherwise authorized by the City Council or Director of Planning and Community Development, native species shall be required for all landscaping and tree planting activities performed as part of land development or construction activities. See section 5-298 for a list of all permitted native species.
(b)
Native plant and tree species shall be required in any/all of the following scenarios:

Whenever street trees are required to be planted or replaced; or
(4)
As otherwise required by the Council or Director of Planning and Community Development.

This section is not applicable to trees or other vegetation planted on single or two-family properties outside of the scenarios outlined in subsection 5-297(b).
