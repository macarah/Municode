ARTICLE 3. - SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS
DIVISION 3.1. - DISTRICTS

Sec. 21-3.1.1. - Districts.
In order to regulate, restrict, and segregate the use of land, buildings and structures; to regulate and restrict the height and bulk of buildings and the area of yards and other open spaces surrounding buildings; to regulate and restrict intensity, geography, and design of mixed-use development to implement the intent of this ordinance, the incorporated area of the City of Avondale Estates, DeKalb County, Georgia, is hereby divided into the following special purpose and mixed-use zoning districts:
EXPAND
District Code District Name General Definition
CBD Central Business District A mixed-use district that allows for the combination of office, service, retail, residential, and other use combinations to support a thriving business district as provided herein.
PUD Planned United Development District A mixed-use district that allows for the combination of a minimum of any two (2) uses in accordance with a specific development plan and standards and subject to approval by the Board of Mayor and Commissioners.
OS-R Open Space and Recreation District A district that supports the City's parks and recreation needs through the development of greenspace and other amenities contributing the quality of life.
  Sec. 21-3.1.2. - General purpose.
As with overlay zoning districts, special purpose zoning districts are tools for dealing with unique neighborhoods or settings, or accomplishing special planning, architecture, zoning goals. Unlike overlay districts, however, special districts are base zoning classifications; they do not "over-lay" other base zoning districts. The purpose specific for each district is contained within the text of each enabled district. When this zoning ordinance refers to "mixed-use districts," it is referring to zoning districts: CBD categorized in this division.
DIVISION 3.2. - CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD)

Sec. 21-3.2.1. - Purpose.
The central business district has been created to further the following public purposes:
A.
Plan compatibility. To guide new development and redevelopment as defined by the City of Avondale Estates Comprehensive Plan and Downtown Development Plan and as amended.
B.
Achieve excellence and creativity in design. Each new development should express excellence in design, use high-quality materials and construction methods, and incorporate characteristics that make it unique to Avondale Estates.
C.
Draw on local design traditions. Existing buildings, such as the Tudor Village, share similar features, materials and forms that reflect the city's design traditions and should inspire new work without copying earlier styles.
D.
Regulate a walkable, beautiful and accessible public realm. Regulate walkable blocks, and promote slow moving traffic, pedestrian, and bike accessibility in a well landscaped environment.
E.
Create an identifiable public realm. Avoid a series of independent private destinations/campuses by standardizing the public streets, sidewalks, and landscaping materials and street furniture by corridor.
F.
Encourage engaging open spaces. Encourage public and private yards, plazas, promenades, courtyards, and other amenities directly facing the public streets.
G.
Support shared street concepts. Walkers, bikers, and drivers share a narrow and landscaped road where right-of-way is very limited.
H.
Mitigate visual impacts of parking. Select appropriate locations or use landscaping and other screening to hide or mitigate the visual impacts of parking lots and decks.
I.
Encourage sustainable development. New and retrofitted buildings should address energy, waste, and water conservation and accommodate all modes of transportation.
J.
Promote vibrant streets with active ground floors. Orient storefronts to face the street, design main entrances to open onto the street, and increase windows and doors along the ground floor.
K.
Regulate height by location. Support transit-oriented development with greater height on blocks adjacent to the MARTA station and on the backside of the rail lines (up to five (5) stories) with lower heights graduating to two (2) or three (3) stories closer to the Tudor Village and along College Avenue/North Avondale Road.
L.
Require multiple entrances with direct connections to the public sidewalk. Design buildings to include multiple entrances with porches, stoops and doors directly connected to the public sidewalk.
M.
Vary massing. Change the heights of different parts of a building and create offsets in wall planes to express individual building modules.
N.
Vary articulation of the building. Vary wall surfaces, change materials, and use different fenestration patterns, or other design variations.
O.
Concentrate retail storefronts in select locations to promote economic stability. Identify street or street sections that require storefronts for retail and restaurants (and those that don't).
P.
Enable and encourage a mix of uses. Allow for a mix of uses throughout the downtown to include a variety of housing types that serve people at all stages of life, retail, restaurants, and offices.
Sec. 21-3.2.2. - Applicability.
A.
The regulations within this section apply to all buildings, structures, and land within the central business district, as illustrated on the regulating plan and on the city's zoning map.
B.
Conflicts with other provisions or requirements. All development authorized by these standards shall conform to all other requirements of the Avondale Estates Zoning Ordinance, except as specifically stated to the contrary in these standards. When a conflict exists between these standards and the other requirements of the ordinance, these standards shall prevail.
Sec. 21-3.2.3. - Regulating plan.
A.
Sub-areas. References in this zoning ordinance to "central business districts" or "CBD sub-areas," or "sub-areas" are references to these districts. Sub-areas are used to determine appropriate façade types, use requirements, and certain site and building development standards specific to each sub-area.
B.
Sub-area boundaries. Each central business district sub-area is designated in figure 21-3.2.3.
Figure 21-3.2.3 - Regulating Plan
Sec. 21-3.2.4. - Central business district-1 (CBD-1).
The CBD-1 sub-area is intended to accommodate the most intensive scale of development, still respecting the maximum grid dimensions and small-town, walkable feel of the overall district. Within a 1,500-foot walkshed of the MARTA heavy rail station, the CBD-1 sub-area is intended to provide housing and commercial uses that support the remainder of the district and encourage transit ridership. Building heights up to five (5) stories are permitted in this district, with required building articulation to break up the massing and transitional height planes to step down the intensity in key locations, such as adjacent to residential uses.

  Sec. 21-3.2.7. - Street typology map.
Street type locations for new and existing streets in the central business district are designated in figure 21-3.2.7.
Figure 21-3.2.7 Street Typology Map
Sec. 21-3.2.8. - Streets and blocks.
A.
Applicability.
1.
The City of Avondale Estates desires a pedestrian-friendly central business district that has adequate transportation infrastructure for residents, visitors, and businesses. The city finds that its existing street grid is inadequate, in terms of pedestrian and vehicular infrastructure, to support the density of development that may be desired. Therefore, in order to ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of transportation infrastructure, the city hereby offers a bonus program that provides development incentives to those developers that voluntarily provide improvement and dedication of transportation infrastructure identified in this section.
2.
Improvements required of every new development and redevelopment meeting the thresholds established by section 21-8.3.9:
a.
Block breaks and improvements per section 21-3.2.8.B - block requirements.
b.
Landscaping, sidewalks, and other pedestrian amenities per section 21-3.2.8.E - streetscapes.
c.
General standards to be met per section 21-3.2.8.F - conditions of improvements.
3.
Voluntary improvements required only if the developer desires to take advantage of the development bonuses set out in table 21-3.2.8.A - development bonuses:
a.
Public road improvements per section 21-3.2.8.C - streets.
b.
Design standards for streets per section 21-3.2.8.D - general standards for streets.
c.
Permitted ability to span rights-of way per section 21-3.2.8.G - air rights.
4.
Regardless, where inadequate infrastructure and lack of internal street network exists to sustain and support the maximum block size, implementation of the street grid is required.

  B.
Block requirements.
1.
Maximum. The maximum block perimeter for the CBD is one thousand six hundred (1,600) feet. The required block length is a maximum of four hundred (400) feet or consistent with the adopted Downtown Avondale Estates Street Grid Plan. Exemptions or departures from these standards pertain to certain blocks based on the street grid plan.
2.
Divisions. Block faces shall be divided by either multi-use paths or streets defined and referenced herein. Multi-use paths shall provide a minimum of ten (10) feet paved width with a two (2)-foot shoulder on each side of the path for the purpose of providing a small separation from the path and any permanent structures.
3.
Measurement. Block perimeter shall be measured from the centerline of the existing or proposed facility (street or multi-use path) used to divide the block face.
4.
Waiver. The city manager may grant a tier 1 waiver to increase the block perimeter/length by up to twenty (20) percent when steep slopes, waterways, flood zones, railroads, stream buffers, greenways, open space, or easements would make the block requirements infeasible.
C.
Streets.
1.
Street regulations apply to new and existing streets per figure 21-3.2.7 - street typology map. The intent of the following regulations is to form an interconnected network of streets to support multiple modes of transportation, including walking, biking, transit use, and driving.
2.
Street type requirements. All Street Type requirements as required by the street typology map and central business district regulations shall be in conformance with these regulations.
a.
Streetscape improvements and other pedestrian improvements shall be provided along all street frontages within the boundaries of the CBD as illustrated on the street typology map and in accordance with division 6.10 - sidewalk, street, and other construction standards.
b.
Improvements shall comply with the most recently adopted version of the Downtown Avondale Estates Street Grid Plan, including all dimensional and material specifications for new and existing roads.
c.
Installation shall meet the requirements in section 21-3.2.8.F - conditions of constructed improvements.
3.
Street types. The following descriptions, illustrations, and streetscape requirements in table 21-3.2.8.E - streetscape dimensions describe the street types permitted in the CBD.
a.
Type A. Type A streets are intended to establish a series of comfortably scaled streets with continuous building frontage and a limited number of drives interrupting the sidewalk. Type A streets support a robust pedestrian realm by prioritizing bicyclists and pedestrians for a more balanced transportation route and support local retailers and business owners by encouraging a vibrant and activated public realm.
b.
Type B. Type B streets are intended to serve, similarly to type A streets, as primary pedestrian corridors with minimal curb cuts, but they are less critical based on their proximity to the retail district; therefore, they can tolerate curb cuts and other minor service needs if no other options are available. Typical cross-sections are illustrated in figure 21-3.2.8.B.4.b. - type B typicals.
Figure 21-3.2.8.B.4.b. Type B Typicals
c.
Type C. Type C streets are intended to establish a designated street for parking lot and structure access, while still providing a safe and comfortable pedestrian realm. Typical cross-sections are illustrated in figure 21-3.2.8.B.4.c. - type C typicals.
Figure 21-3.2.8.B.4.c. Type C Typicals
d.
Type D. Type D streets are shared streets. Type D streets are intended to work closely within the existing right-of-way to support the possibility of incremental redevelopment of a walkable warehouse district. There is no formal separation between modes of transportation; therefore, these streets are very low speed and marked by special details and materials like enhanced landscaping and paver systems. Typical cross-sections are illustrated in figure 21-3.2.8.B.4.d. - type D typicals.
Figure 21-3.2.8.B.4.d. - Type D Typicals
e.
Type E. Type E streets are also considered alleys. Type E streets are intended to provide access and service to adjacent parcels. When possible, they shall provide sole vehicular access to those lots. Where existing alleys are encroached, they shall be re-established as a function of any redevelopment activity exceeding the seventy (70) percent threshold in table 21-8.3.9 - redevelopment improvements, or for any full site development.
D.
General standards for streets.
1.
Public and private streets shall comply with the minimum construction standards for public streets found in appendix B - subdivision regulations, division 6.10 - sidewalk, street, and other construction standards, and other applicable sections of the City Code.
2.
All new streets shall connect at least two (2) streets or provide a temporary street stub that will allow for a future connection between at least two (2) streets. This provision is not intended to require connections to streets that are located entirely outside the boundaries of the CBD. No permanent cul-de-sac or other permanent dead end street design is permitted.
3.
Curbing.
a.
The maximum allowed curb radius at any intersection or curb is twenty (20) feet.
b.
Granite curbing is required. The curbing for such street improvement, extension, or reconstruction shall be granite curbing of a similar size and type as the granite curbing used on such existing street or the closest existing street containing granite curbing.
4.
Access.
a.
No curb cuts are allowed on type A streets if the subject lot has access to another street type. Lots with access solely to type A streets are allowed a maximum of one (1) curb cut.
b.
Lots with access to type B or C streets are allowed a maximum of one (1) curb cut on either such street.
c.
Curb cuts may not exceed twenty-four (24) feet in width.
d.
Access driveways shall be perpendicular to the abutting street.
e.
Gates and security arms are prohibited on public and private streets that require public access.
f.
On lots with more than one (1) street frontage, access and off-street parking shall not be located in front of the primary building on the street with the higher classification based on the following order from highest to lowest: North Avondale Road, North Clarendon Avenue, Washington Street, Oak Street, Center Street, Lake Street, Laredo Drive, Parry Street, Green Street, Hilyer Avenue, Olive Street, Locust Street, Pine Street, Maple Street, Elm Street, and Potter Avenue.
g.
Driveways, except for a driveway to reach the side yard or rear yard or an on-site parking facility, are not permitted between the sidewalk and a building, and shall be perpendicular to any adjacent street.
5.
External agency reviews.
a.
Should the DeKalb County Fire Marshal's requirements and those set forth herein conflict, the fire marshal's requirements shall govern without the need for additional relief from the Code.
b.
The following provisions apply to lots that abut a right-of-way controlled by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT):
i.
Should any of the requirements herein conflict, the GDOT requirements shall govern without the need for additional relief from the Code.
ii.
An approved permit for proposed access or improvements is required from GDOT and shall be incorporated into the construction drawings for the project before the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
E.
Streetscape. In general, streetscapes shall consist of a landscape zone, sidewalk zone, and in some cases, a supplemental zone, dependent on table 21-3.2.8.E - streetscape dimensions.

2.
Landscape zones. The landscape zone starts at the back of the curb and extends inward (toward the lot) for the minimum distance and no more than the maximum distance indicated in table 21-3.2.8.E - streetscape dimensions. This area is generally intended to accommodate trees, plants, lights, and similar landscape elements.
a.
Required street trees are identified by corridor in the Downtown Avondale Estates Street Grid Plan.
b.
Street trees shall be planted in all landscape zones spaced on center as follows, based on the type of tree planted:

Streetlights shall be located within the landscape zone and spaced a distance consistent with the Downtown Avondale Estates Street Grid Plan.
e.
Landscape zones shall be planted with grass, ground cover, or flowering plants.
3.
Sidewalk zones. The sidewalk zone starts at the inner edge of the landscape zone and extends inward (toward the lot) for the minimum distance and no more than the maximum distance indicated in table 21-3.2.8.E - streetscape dimensions. This area is intended exclusively to accommodate unimpeded pedestrian movement.
a.
Sidewalk zones shall be paved in concrete and kept clear and unobstructed for the safe and convenient use of pedestrians. There shall be a minimum ten (10) feet vertical clearance maintained on all sidewalk zones.
Figure 21-3.2.8.D - Paving Materials Across Driveways
b.
Paving materials shall be continued across any intervening driveway at the same prevailing grade and cross slope as on the adjacent pedestrian zone area.
c.
When newly constructed sidewalks abut adjacent sidewalks, the newly constructed sidewalk shall provide safe facilitation of pedestrian traffic flow to those adjacent sidewalks. If the adjacent sidewalk is deficient with respect to the standards of the ordinance, the subject sidewalk shall figure 21-3.2.8.D - paving materials across driveways taper to match the width of the adjacent sidewalks.
d.
If no adjacent sidewalk exists, the new sidewalk shall terminate at the property line at the required width at the grade and location of the adjacent sidewalk zone. The sidewalk on the subject property shall be graded to facilitate a future direct connection to the sidewalk (e.g.: it shall not terminate at a retaining wall).
e.
Any development that disturbs existing sidewalks on an adjacent property shall replace disturbed areas to their pre-disturbance state and condition.
f.
Safe and convenient pedestrian pathways shall be provided from sidewalks along streets to each publicly accessible building entrance, including pedestrian access routes to parking decks, through parking lots, and between adjacent buildings within the same development. All such pathways shall be paved, with a minimum width of four (4) feet, or the width required by the underlying zoning district or ADA accessibility criteria, whichever width is greater.
4.
Supplemental zones. The supplemental zone starts at the inner edge of the pedestrian zone and extends inward (toward the lot) for the minimum distance and no more than the maximum distance indicated in table 21-3.2.8.E - streetscape dimensions. This area is intended to accommodate active uses along the street frontage with amenities such as widened sidewalk zones, outdoor seating, and landscaping.
a.
The supplemental zone shall be located on private property.
b.
Benches, trash receptacles, and bike racks shall be placed within the supplemental zone. Other amenities are permitted, such as seat walls, provided they meet the intent and dimensional requirements of the supplemental zone.
i.
Such features shall be provided at a ratio of not less than one (1) bench, one (1) trash and one (1) recycling receptacle, and one (1) bike rack per three hundred (300) feet of street frontage, or portion thereof.
ii.
Bike racks provided to meet this requirement may be counted towards satisfying short-term bicycle parking requirements of table 21-6.2.3 - parking requirements.
iii.
Where a supplemental zone is not required or does not exist, these amenities shall be located in the landscape zone.
c.
The supplemental zone shall be no more than twenty-four (24) inches higher than the adjacent sidewalk, unless existing topographical conditions render this requirement unreasonable, per approval of the city manager through the permit review process.
d.
Provided the other provisions of this section are met, other activation of the supplemental zone is permitted and encouraged, to include outdoor dining, public art installations, landscaping and planter boxes, and retail sales.
5.
Insufficient right-of-way width. On existing streets with insufficient right-of-way width to accommodate the required landscape and sidewalk zone elements, the right-of-way needed to accommodate the required streetscape elements shall be dedicated to the city prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy.
F.
Conditions of improvements.
1.
Construction obligations. All improvements shall be constructed and dedicated to the city by the developer.
2.
Partial improvements. Where the subject property is adjacent to the location of a new street shown on the street grid plan but said planned new street is partially on private property not owned by the developer or a related entity, the developer may comply with the bonus requirements for new street build-out by making only the planned improvements shown on the subject property by the street grid plan. Streets may be constructed as one-way until the full planned street is built out.
3.
Omit from lot calculations. Any new or reconstructed streets constructed as a function of this section shall not count against maximum lot coverage and shall not be included in the lot size for calculating open space dimensions, tree density requirements, or any other standard determined using the area of the lot. In these cases, the area of the road can be completely omitted from the lot area calculation (i.e.: the area taken up by the road is not used in the coverage area, nor in the total lot area).
4.
Timing. All improvements shall be installed prior to the final certificate of occupancy, project close-out, or prior to approval of a final plat.
G.
Air rights.
1.
Where bonus criteria are met for a project, the city will grant air rights to permit occupiable bridge structures that span streets by connecting portions of buildings across rights-of-way, for the purpose of providing circulation.
2.
A maximum of one (1) bridge is permitted per block.
3.
Bridges are only permitted on structures that exceed three (3) stories in height and must be installed at least thirty (30) feet above the right-of-way.

2.
General. A general façade is intended to be sited close to the sidewalk but may also allow for open spaces and landscaping between the building and public realm. The building is structured to allow single or multi-story development that typically accommodates non-residential uses, such as hotel or office uses on all stories, or multi-family residential uses. The general façade type may accommodate limited amounts of accessory retail and service uses on the ground floor.
Figure 21-3.2.9.B.3 General Façade Type
3.
Walk-up. Walk-up façades typically house multi-family uses with ground floor units that have entrances facing a sidewalk or public street. Additionally, the design requirements for walk-up façades establish tenant spaces supportive of retail and other service uses in mixed use environments.
