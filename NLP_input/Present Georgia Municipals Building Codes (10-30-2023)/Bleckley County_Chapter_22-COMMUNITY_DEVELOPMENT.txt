Sec. 22-19. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The governing authorities of the county and the City of Cochran, Georgia, find it necessary, desirable, and in the public interest to establish a formal process for resolving land use disputes as they relate to property annexation and land use plans.

(Res. of 5-21-1998)
Sec. 22-20. - Procedure.
(a)
Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, the municipality will notify the county of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classification, if applicable, of the property.
(b)
Within 30 days following receipt of the information required in subsection (a) of this section, the county will forward to the city a statement indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property or describing its bona fide objection to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting evidence, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objections.
(c)
If the county has no objection to the city's proposed land use or zoning classification, the city is free to proceed with the annexation. If the county fails to respond to the city's notice in writing within the deadline, the city is free to proceed with the annexation and the county loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, or object to land use changes after the annexation.
(d)
If the county notifies the city that it has bona fide land use classification objections, the city will respond to the county in writing within 30 days of receiving the county's objections by either:
(1)
Agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions, thereby resolving the county's objection;
(2)
Agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; or
(3)
Disagreeing that the county's objections are bona fide, in which event the city will initiate a joint meeting of the respective governments to resolve the issue.
(e)
If the city initiates mediation, the city and the county will agree on a mediator, mediation schedule and determine participants on the mediation. The city and county agree to share equally any costs associated with the mediation.
(f)
An annexation proposal shall not be effective until any bona fide land use classification objections raised by the county are resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process.
(g)
The final resolution of any recommendation of a land use classification will be accorded to the governing body considering the annexation. In cases of land use disputes not related to annexation proposals, the final resolution of a land use dispute will be accorded to the jurisdiction in which the subject property is located. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a government may seek declaratory judgment in a court of proper jurisdiction pursuant to a land use decision.

(a)
Prior to initiating any extensions of water or sewer services outside the boundaries of that respective local government, the city seeking such an extension will notify the county government of the proposed extension.

(2)
Describing its bona fide objections to the proposed water or sewer extension stating why the proposal is incompatible with the land use plan or ordinances, and providing supporting information including a listing of any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objections.
(c)
If the county has no objection, or fails to respond within 30 working days, to the city's proposed extraterritorial water or sewer extension, the city is free to proceed with the provision of the service.
(d)
If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide objection, the city will respond to the county in writing within 30 working days by either:
(1)
Agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed extraterritorial water or sewer service extension;
(2)
Agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions, thereby resolving the county's objection;
(3)
Requesting a meeting and informal resolution of the issues, including discussing a formal change, of necessary to the land use plan;
(4)
Disagreeing that the county's objection is bona fide and asking for county reconsideration, or requesting a meeting and informal resolution.

A proposal to extend extraterritorial water and sewer service shall not be implemented until any bona fide land use or land use ordinance inconsistencies are resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process, or have been taken to mediation.
(h)
If no resolution of the county's objection occurs even after mediation, the city may drop the proposal and not proceed with the extension or take court action to obtain a declaratory judgment or otherwise take appropriate action that would lawfully allow the extension.
(i)
The final determination of the compatibility of the proposed extension with the land use plan or land use ordinances will be accorded to the governing body receiving the proposed service extension, unless court action determines that the county's objection is not bona fide and a declaratory judgment is obtained.
(j)
This extraterritorial process for water and sewer services shall remain in force and effect until amended or terminated by operation of law.
