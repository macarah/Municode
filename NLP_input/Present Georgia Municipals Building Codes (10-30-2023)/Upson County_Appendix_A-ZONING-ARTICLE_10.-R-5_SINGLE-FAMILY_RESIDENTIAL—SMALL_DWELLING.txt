ARTICLE 10. - R-5 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL—SMALL DWELLING

Section 1001. - Purpose.
R-5 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet, relatively low-density neighborhoods of single-family residences as desired by large numbers of people, while permitting smaller dwellings than many other residential districts require. These districts are free from other uses which are incompatible with single-family homes.
Section 1002. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an R-5 district.
The factors contained in section 410 of this ordinance must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the board of commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation for land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Upson County.
Section 1003. - Boundaries of R-5 districts.
The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all R-5 districts within Upson County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
Section 1004. - Permitted uses.
