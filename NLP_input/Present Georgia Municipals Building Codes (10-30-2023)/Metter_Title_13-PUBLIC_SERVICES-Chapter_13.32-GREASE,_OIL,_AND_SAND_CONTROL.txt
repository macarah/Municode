Chapter 13.32 - GREASE, OIL, AND SAND CONTROL
Sections:

13.32.10 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to control discharges into the public sewerage collection system and wastewater treatment plant that interfere with the operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines, interfere with normal operation of pumps and their controls, and contribute waste of a strength or form that either causes treatment difficulties or is beyond the treatment capability of the wastewater treatment plant.
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1)
13.32.20 - Definitions.
[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]
Grease. Material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease (FOG) from animal or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil, and, grease shall be deemed as grease by definition. Grease does not include petroleum based products.
Grease trap. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also serve to collect settlable solids, generated by and from food preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system.
Food service establishments. Those establishments primarily engaged in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching. Also included are infared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
These facilities include restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing plants, or any other sewer users as determined by the city's public works director.
User. Any person or establishment including those located outside the jurisdictional limits of the city who contributes, causes, or permits the contribution or discharge of wastewater into the city's wastewater collection or treatment system, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
Oil/water separator. An approved and industry standard system that is specifically designed and manufactured to separate oil from water. The system shall allow the oil to be collected and removed on a regular basis as to prevent it from being discharged into the wastewater collection system. Only oil/water separators manufactured for that specific operation will be approved. Adequate support literature from the manufacturer will be required so as to allow a proper review by the public works director.
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1)
13.32.30 - General criteria.
A.
Installation requirements. All existing, proposed, or newly remodeled food service establishments inside the City of Metter wastewater service area shall be required to install, at the user's expense an approved, properly operated and maintained grease trap, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
B.
Sanitary sewer flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals, lavatories, etc. shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These flows shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
C.
Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
D.
Garbage grinders/disposers. It is recommended that solid food waste products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a grinder/disposal is used it must be connected to the grease trap. The use of grinders is discouraged since it decreases the operational capacity of the grease trap and will require an increased pumping frequency to ensure continuous and effective operation.
E.
Dishwashers. Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease trap. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and allow it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized accordingly to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify and float to the top of the trap.
F.
Location. Grease trap shall be installed outside the building upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow easy access for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building without written approval of the public works director.
G.
Pass through limits. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the city's sanitary sewer system any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the city's waste system whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1)
13.32.40 - Implementation.
A.
New plumbing systems. Notwithstanding other respectable authority, and unless otherwise exempted in this section, this chapter shall apply to all food service establishments that discharge to the sewers of the city.
B.
Altered or remodeled plumbing systems. Notwithstanding other respectable authority, all existing food service establishments servicing users other than individual residential users that are altered or remodeled as to the requirements of this chapter, and which discharge into the sewers of the city shall be in compliance with this chapter.
C.
Existing installations. The city may require, at the user's expense, the installation of exterior or interior grease interceptors for existing plumbing installations where the capacity of the sewer system is reduced due to congealed grease, or where congealed grease otherwise impairs the proper functioning of the sewer system.
All existing food service establishments, determined by the public works director to have a reasonable potential to adversely impact the city's sewer system will be notified of their obligations to install a grease interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification letter.
D.
Variance from requirements. Grease interceptors required under this chapter shall be installed unless the public works director authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap or other alternative pretreatment technology and determines that the installation of a grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of the interceptor is not feasible. The public works director may authorize the installation of an indoor grease trap where the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible due to space constraints or other considerations. If an establishment believes the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible, because of documented space constraints, the request for an alternate grease removal device shall contain the following language:
(1)
Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building.
(2)
Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all services.
Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to, devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. All alternative pretreatment technology must the appropriately sized and approved by the public works director.
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1)
13.32.50 - Design criteria.
modified
