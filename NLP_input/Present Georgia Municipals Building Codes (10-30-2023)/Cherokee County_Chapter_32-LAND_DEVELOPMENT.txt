For a multi-use property or speculative development when the final use of the property is not known, the administrator may assess the impact fee when the building permit is issued based on the most likely occupancy, and delay collection of the impact fee until a determination of the actual use is made prior to issuance of a certificate of completion or approval of a certificate of occupancy, as applicable and appropriate.
(b)

(2)
Expenditures from the impact fee account for a particular public facility category shall be made only for projects that are listed for that category in the most recently adopted Capital Improvements Element.

Credits; restrictions.
a.
Except as provided in subsection (2) below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this article.
b.
If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements to public facilities as defined herein, prior to the effective date of this article, is greater than the impact fee which would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of Cherokee County, Georgia, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area.
c.
In no event shall credit be given for project improvements.
(2)
Granting of credits.
a.
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer.
b.
Developers, who construct system improvements, privately or in conjunction with Cherokee County for which impact fees would otherwise be imposed, shall be entitled to a credit. The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall be equal to the present value of the cost of construction of the system improvement, up to a maximum of the impact fee due for such system improvement. In the event that a developer enters into an agreement with Cherokee County to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements such that the amount of the credit created is in excess of the impact fee which would otherwise have been paid for the development project, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess construction, funding, or contribution from impact fees paid by other development located in the service area which is benefitted by such improvements.
(3)
Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by Cherokee County, Georgia, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the board of commissioners of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.
a.
For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by Cherokee County, Georgia, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated.
b.
For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by Cherokee County, Georgia, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Cherokee County, Georgia would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less.
c.
For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his predecessor in title or interest accepted by Cherokee County, Georgia, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.
d.
In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
(4)
Credits; application.
a.
Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the board of commissioners. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the board of commissioners at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.
b.
The board of commissioners, in its sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit.
c.
Any credit approved by the board of commissioners shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment.
d.
In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by Cherokee County, Georgia, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.
