Commercial and industrial customers who have maintained their utility accounts without more than one penalty assessment per year, and with no cutoffs within the immediate past three years, will be allowed to lower their deposit requirements to an average of one month's billing based on the immediate past 12 months' history; however, should the customer receive more than one penalty assessment or a cutoff, the customer will be required to increase the deposit immediately to an average of two months' billing based on the immediate past 12 months' history.

(d)
At least once each year the city shall review the records of the monthly electrical/water and sewer usage for each commercial and industrial electrical/water or sewer customer, and the security deposit for each such customer shall be adjusted accordingly based upon the average monthly electrical/water or sewer usage for the past 12 months.
