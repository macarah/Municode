(f)
Real estate brokers, agents, or companies that sell real property located in the city but that do not maintain a principal or branch office within the city shall only have taxes levied upon them based on the administrative fee and profitability ratios in combination with gross receipts.

(2)
Owns personal or real property which generates income and which is located within the jurisdiction of the city.

The fee referenced above shall be established by the mayor and council by resolution from time to time.
(b)
This election is to be made on an annual basis and must be done March 31 of each year. If no election is made, the tax shall be levied as if subsection (a)(2) above were elected.

It is the intention of the mayor and council that no portion of this taxation plan be construed to be, or have the practical effect of, regulation of or a precondition on the practice of state regulated professions. If any provision hereof shall be construed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be an unlawful regulation of such profession, then such provision shall be considered rescinded by the mayor and council as if such provision had not been adopted, and in such case, the remaining provisions of this article shall be applied to such practitioner.

(b)
Except for practitioners of professions and occupations, upon filling an occupation tax return and paying all due taxes, fees and penalties, an occupation tax certificate shall be issued by the occupation tax clerk. If any person, firm, or corporation whose duty it is to obtain an occupation tax certificate shall, after said occupation tax becomes delinquent, transact or offer to transact, in the city, any business, profession, trade or occupation subject to this article without having first obtained said certificate, such offender upon conviction by the municipal judge shall be subject to a civil fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) which may be enforced by the contempt power of the municipal court and such offender will also be subject to penalties and administrative fees imposed herein on delinquent tax returns and payments.

Sec. 11-21. - Returns confidential.
Except in the case of judicial proceedings, or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax hereby levied, or as disclosure may be required by the Georgia Open Records Act, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee or agent of the city, or any other person, to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross receipts or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any occupation tax return required under this article. All contents of said return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents, or clerks of the city using said returns for the purpose of this occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the city shall be classed as "employees." Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the publication by city officials of statistics, so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof; or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax departments of the state, the United States, and other local governments.
(Ord. No. 2013-13, § 1, 11-4-13)
Sec. 11-22. - Inspections of books and records.
The city clerk, through his/her officers, agents, employees, or representatives, may inspect the books of the business or profession for which any returns are made. The city clerk shall have the right to inspect the books or records that document and support the gross receipts for the business or profession for which the return was made in this city and upon demand of the city clerk, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the city within thirty (30) days. Failure to submit such books or records within thirty (30) days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax certificate. In the case of practitioners of professions and occupations, the city shall be sensitive to the issues of client or customer confidentiality. In such cases, the practitioner may redact information claimed to be privileged before disclosing books or records of financial transactions. If such practitioner alleges that redaction provides inadequate protection to the confidences of his clients or customers, such practitioner may petition the Superior Court of Clayton County or the Superior Court of Fulton County, as appropriate, for an in camera inspection, prior to examination by the tax clerk. Except for practitioners of professions and occupations electing to pay a flat fee in lieu of a gross receipts tax, adequate records shall be kept in the city, for examination by the city clerk at that officer's discretion. If after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a delinquency occurs as a result of under reporting, an administrative fee in the amount of one and one-half (1.5) per cent per month for the applicable period in addition to a ten (10) per cent penalty will be assessed for the period of the delinquency.

No new occupation tax certificate shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax herein provided for is at that time unpaid, or to an individual, firm, or corporation who has failed to submit the information and records as requested by the occupation tax clerk in accordance with provisions found in this article.
(b)
Except for practitioners of professions and occupations, any person, his manager, agent, or employee, who does business in the city after the occupation tax for said business becomes delinquent, or who is required to make occupation tax returns, and who fails to make said returns within the time and in the manner herein provided, or who refuses to amend any such return so as to set forth the truth, or who makes false returns, and, any person, his manager, agent, or employee who refuses to permit an inspection of books in his charge when the officer, agent, employee, or representative of the city requests such inspection, during business hours, and under the terms and conditions set forth herein, for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the returns herein provided for, shall be subject to penalties and administrative fees as provided in sections 11-10 and 11-16 and as authorized under the laws of this state.

Except, however, that this article shall in no manner authorize the city municipal court, or any court, to punish or penalize, by incarceration, practitioners of professions and occupations who fail to comply with this article.

(Ord. No. 2013-13, § 1, 11-4-13)
Sec. 11-24. - Lien taken for delinquent occupation tax.
In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the occupation tax clerk of the city, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against the person liable for said tax, and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person, partnership or corporation liable for said tax. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the chief of police of the city upon property located in the city of any person, his manager, agent, or employee, who does business in the city after the tax for said business becomes delinquent, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with administrative fees, penalties and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the laws of Georgia, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. For all other taxpayers, except for practitioners of professions and occupations, when a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the occupation tax clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all administrative fees, penalties and costs accrued on the tax, the person may request a refund of any fees and charges paid by him or her as a result of the default as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Sec. 11-25. - Amendment, repeal of provision.
This article shall be subject to amendment or repeal, in whole or in part, at any time and no such amendment or repeal shall be construed to deny the right of the mayor and council to assess and collect any of the taxes or other charges prescribed. Said amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the jurisdiction of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property, or business.

All business and occupation taxpayers are required to comply with the provisions of all regulations, ordinances, and laws of the city, the state, and the United States of America.

(c)
Taxes are also refundable upon written request after a valid amendment is accepted and the business tax credited excess the tax liability.
