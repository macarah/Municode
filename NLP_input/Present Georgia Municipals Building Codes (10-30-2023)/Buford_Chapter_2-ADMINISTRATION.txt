ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 2-1. - Acceptance of credit card payments to city.
(a)
All sums due the city, including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, occupation taxes, fines, forfeitures, penalties, license fees, permit fees, and registration fees may be paid by the use of credit cards. The city clerk, with the approval of the city manager, shall establish the procedures for acceptance of credit card payments for amounts due the city. The city manager is authorized to enter into agreements with credit card issuers to facilitate the acceptance of credit card payment by the city.
(b)
A credit card agreement may provide for the acceptance of the credit card payments from the credit card company at a discount from the face amount of the payment or for the withholding of administrative fees from the face amount of the payment. Such discounted fee is granted in exchange for the improved governmental cash flow, reduction of administrative expenses, and increased public convenience as a result of credit card payments.
(c)
A surcharge equal to the administrative fees charged by the credit card issuer to the city shall be imposed upon any person making a payment by credit card, when such surcharges are permitted by the operating rules and regulations of the credit card issuer.
(d)
Any agreement with a credit card issuer for the acceptance or payments via credit shall contain a provision that the agreement may be canceled at any time by the city.
(e)
No person making payment by credit card to the city is relieved from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that the city actually received final payment of the obligation in cash or its equivalent. If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation for the money due is not extinguished. All applicable penalties, interest, and collection fees on the unpaid amount shall be due from the person who made the payment by credit card. Such penalties, interest, and fees on an unpaid amount shall accrue from the date the unpaid obligation was first due under the applicable statute or ordinance. The city shall follow the collection procedures for the unpaid amount that would have otherwise been applicable had the credit card payment not been attempted.

The decision of the board of ethics shall be in writing and rendered to the commission within five days after completion of the hearing at which point the city commission shall subsequently hold a meeting to consider the board's decision and render penalty or punishment, if any.
