ARTICLE VII. - ROAD ABANDONMENT AND CLOSURE

Sec. 22-160. - Purpose.
The county will follow and adhere to O.C.G.A. § 32-7-2, which outlines the procedure for consideration of abandonment of a public road in the county road system, including required notices, advertisements, and public hearings. The code section language relating to abandonment of a county road is as follows:
(1)
When determined that a section of the county road system has for any reason ceased to be used by the public to the extent that no substantial public purpose is served by it or that its removal from the county road system is otherwise in the best public interest, the county, by certification recorded in its minutes, accompanied by a plat or sketch, and after notice to property owners located thereon, after notice of such determination is published once a week for a period of two weeks, and after a public hearing on such issue, may declare that section of the county road system abandoned and the rights of the public in and to the section of road as a public road shall cease.
(2)
Prior to certifying the abandonment of a road or section thereof, the county shall give notice of its intention to the municipality into which or through which any part of such road passes.
(Ord. No. 2019-02 , § 9-160, 2-26-2019)
Sec. 22-161. - Additional requirements.
(a)
In addition to the requirements under state law, the county shall post notification signs of the proposed road closure at prominent locations in the area to provide notice to the citizens who live or travel along the proposed route to be closed. Signage shall indicate the proposed closure and the date, time, and location of the public hearing.
(b)
If abandoned, said road shall not be reopened as a public road or considered for acceptance into the county road system unless the road has been upgraded to meet all county road standards in effect at the date of the request.
(c)
The party requesting abandonment shall be responsible for all costs of surveys, plats, deeds and any other legal documents necessary to complete the abandonment procedure and conveyance of such property. The requesting party shall also be responsible for any advertising costs including but not limited to any public notices or signage required by county policy or state law.
(Ord. No. 2019-02 , § 9-161, 2-26-2019)
Sec. 22-162. - Considerations in determining road abandonment/closure.
In addition to compliance with all applicable state laws, the county shall also consider the following criteria in determining road closure and abandonment:
(1)
Do all property owners who live or own property on the roadway proposed for closure agree with the closure?
(2)
Does the road continue to serve a substantial public purpose or is closure otherwise in the best public interest?
(3)
Does the closure of the roadway create a situation where any property owner, other than the requesting party, is limited to only one means of ingress or egress?
(4)
Is the roadway commonly used as a shorter access route to other roadways? If so, does the closure create and undue hardship on the travelling public?
(5)
Does the course of the roadway impact the delivery of emergency services to the general public?
(6)
Does the cost of maintaining the road section exceed the amount of funding received from GDOT, LMIG and other sources for maintenance of said road?
(7)
Does the road abandonment prevent access to family cemeteries? If so, will an access easement be provided?
(8)
The county shall request input from the county sheriff's office, all public safety departments, E-911, and public works, and consider any comments received from those departments in making the decision.
(9)
Any additional information that may be important in the determination of closure of the road.
(Ord. No. 2019-02 , § 9-162, 2-26-2019)
Sec. 22-163. - Abandoned with deeded right-of-way.
If abandoned with a deeded right-of-way, the county shall establish a fair market value and receive compensation for the property.
(Ord. No. 2019-02 , § 9-163, 2-26-2019)
Sec. 22-164. - Abandoned with prescriptive right-of-way.
If abandoned with a prescriptive right-of-way, the county's only interest in the property is the right of use for ingress and egress. Once abandoned, the property would revert back to the adjoining owners, and the county would execute a quit claim deed to those property owners.
(Ord. No. 2019-02 , § 9-164, 2-26-2019)
Sec. 22-165. - Required legal documents.
If a road section is abandoned, the requesting party shall provide all necessary legal documents for conveyance of the property.
