ARTICLE V. - REDEVELOPMENT TAX INCENTIVE

Sec. 22-186. - Purpose; definitions.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The city recognizes the existence of real property that is maintained in a blighted condition. Such properties increase the need for governmental services, including, but not limited to, social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. The city finds the rehabilitation of blighted properties decreases the need for such government services and the costs to the city's taxpayers.
(2)
In furtherance of the city's objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, the mayor and council, in the exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations in O.C.G.A. § 36-61-5 et seq., have designated and continue to designate those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
(3)
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by article IX, section II, paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 constitution of the state.

(1)
A request may be made by a public officer or by at least five residents of the city charging that the building, structure, or property meets the criteria for blighted property designation.

Service in the manner set forth at O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12 shall constitute sufficient notice to the property's owner or person chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes for purpose of this section, except that posting of the notice on the property will not be required.

(d)
At the hearing, the public officer shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this article.

Upon finding required work to be satisfactorily performed, the public officer shall issue a written determination that the real property is no longer maintained in a blighted condition. Copies of this determination shall be served upon the persons chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes, and upon the city clerk.

(a)
Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, as provided in section 22-189, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.5 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the persons chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years.
(b)
In order to claim entitlement for a decreased rate of taxation, the persons chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property shall submit a notarized affidavit to the public officer, supported by receipts or other evidence of payment, of the amount expended.
