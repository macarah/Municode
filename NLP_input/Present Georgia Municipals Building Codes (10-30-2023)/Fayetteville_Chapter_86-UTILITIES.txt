Hydrologic response. The hydrologic response of a parcel of property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from the property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition.
(d)
Impervious surface. Impervious surface is the area which prevents or impedes the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as the water would have infiltrated under natural conditions prior to the parcel's development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, swimming pools, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to the property's development.
(e)
Stormwater management systems address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion, and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds and reservoirs. Stormwater management systems address these issues through improving, maintaining, regulating and funding instrumentalities used in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage.
(f)
Undeveloped land. Land in its unaltered natural state or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface which impedes the infiltration of stormwater or causes stormwater to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural state by the creation or installation of less than 1,000 square feet of impervious surface.
(g)
Residential dwelling property shall mean developed land containing one detached dwelling unit, including houses, manufactured homes and mobile homes on individual lots, and shall mean developed land containing attached dwelling units such as duplexes, triplexes apartments, condominiums, townhouses or mobile home parks; where two or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. Developed land may be classified as a residential dwelling property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Developed land may be classified as a residential dwelling property despite the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas, such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or additions to the building which are used as offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar non-residential uses. Residential dwelling property shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living home.
(h)
Developed land is defined as all property altered from its natural state by the construction or installation of 1,000 or more square feet of impervious surface.
(i)
Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) is defined as the median area of impervious surface established in residential dwelling properties in the city as determined by the city's consulting engineers, and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges to residential dwelling properties, and other developed properties. Three thousand eight hundred square feet of impervious surface shall be one equivalent runoff unit.
(j)
Other developed properties includes, but shall not be limited to, commercial and office buildings, shopping and retail centers, public buildings and structures, gasoline stations, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private educational facilities, hospitals, convalescent centers, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes, assisted living homes, commercial uses, industrial uses, institutional uses and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces.
(k)
Service charges are defined as the periodic rate, fee or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters, which influence the utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious surface as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes or similarly-situated properties whose impact on the utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater services charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, the inspection of development projects, the inspection of on-site stormwater control systems and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the utility.
(l)
Occupant is defined as the individual residing or conducting business on the property. In a family or household circumstance, the individual responsible for the obligation imposed by this article shall be the adult head of the household. In a commercial circumstance, the adult legally responsible for the management or condition of the property shall be responsible for the obligation imposed by this article.
(m)
Owner is defined as the legal owner(s) of record as shown on the tax records of Fayette County except where there is a recorded land sale contract, the purchaser there under shall be deemed the owner.
(n)
User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. The occupant of any habitable property is deemed the user. If the property is not occupied, then the owner shall be deemed the user.
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04)
Sec. 86-102. - Scope of responsibility for the stormwater management system.
(a)
The city stormwater management system consists of all city streets, curbs and gutters, rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the city which control and/or intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and public and private properties, and which are state or United States' waters, owned by the city or over which the city has an easement for stormwater control. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which (1) are located within public streets, rights-of-way and easements and (2) the segments which are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities.
(b)
In consideration for the city allowing the utility to use the city's existing street, curbs, gutters, drainage ways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and man-made within and owned by the city which controls and diverts surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface and stormwaters; the utility shall not charge the city a service charge or fee for the city's impervious surface area resulting from the city's impervious surfaces which are owned and/or maintained by the city within the public right of ways.
(c)
It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with an individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit approval, inspection, or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to any other regulatory ordinance, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents.
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04)
Sec. 86-103. - Determination and modification of stormwater service charges.
Stormwater service charges or fees shall be determined and modified from time to time by action of the city council. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the objective of the city council to establish rates, fees and charges that are fair and reasonable and reflect the value of stormwater management and facilities relative to the benefit derived by the properties. Stormwater service charges or fees shall be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on any revenue bond obligation incurred for the construction and improvement to the stormwater system, as applicable.
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04)
Sec. 86-104. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges.
Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from the utility service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater services charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities.
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04)
Sec. 86-105. - Stormwater service charges/fees.
(a)
Stormwater service charges shall be billed starting with the first billing cycle in February, 2004 except as specific exemptions and credits may apply.
(b)
The following ERU standards shall apply:
(1)
Stormwater service charges are based upon the number of ERU or increment thereof associated with developed land. The charge per ERU shall be $4.37 per month.
(2)
Residential dwelling properties. Residential dwelling properties shall be charged a stormwater fee of one ERU per dwelling unit per month.
(3)
Other developed properties. All developed properties not classified as residential dwelling properties shall be billed for one ERU for each 3,800 square feet of impervious surface. Increments of impervious surface less than 3,800 square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills, i.e. 1,000 to 3,799 square feet of impervious surface, which shall be billed at the rate for one ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the development shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased or owned interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior or exterior space available for occupancy.
(c)
The customer of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the service charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for water or sewer services. If the developed property does not receive city water or sewer services the occupant or user, if no occupant or user then the owner, shall be billed. Regardless, of whether or not the developed property has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the service charge.
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04; Ord. No. 0-12-14, arts. I, II, 7-17-14)
Sec. 86-106. - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies, collections.
Failure to receive a bill for stormwater services is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the Owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of Fayette County, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill for a period of up to three years, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency.
(Ord. No. 0-1-04, art. I, 1-15-04)
Sec. 86-107. - Appeals.
Any person who can show that the impervious area allocated to such person's property is in error may appeal in the following manner:
(a)
An appeal shall be filed in writing with the City of Fayetteville city manager. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events.
(b)
Using the information provided by the appellant, the city manager may conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within 60 days.
(c)
In response to an appeal, the city manager may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to the property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this article.
(d)
There shall be no further administrative appeal beyond the city manager.

Where necessary in the opinion of the director, the owner shall provide, at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to:
(1)
Reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to 300 milligrams per liter and the suspended solids to 350 milligrams per liter by weight, or
(2)
Reduce objectionable characteristics of constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in this section, or
(3)
Control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the commission together with a letter from the director approving the proposed preliminary treatment facilities, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing.
(g)
Where preliminary treatment facilities are required for any waters or waste no permit will be granted until such pretreatment units have been placed in operation and have demonstrated their effectiveness by test. The cost of such testing, sampling and analyzing shall be borne by the waste contributor. Said preliminary treatment facilities shall be maintained continuously and satisfactorily in effective operation by the owner at his expense.
(h)
When required by the director, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying commercial-industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required shall be conveniently and safely located. It is to be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(i)
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in subsections (c) and (f) shall be determined in accordance with "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewerage" or with methods approved by the city engineer and may be determined at the control manhole provided for in subsection (h), or upon suitable samples taken at said manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole may be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. If, in the judgment of the director, analyses must be performed which are beyond the scope of the laboratory at the sewage treatment plant, these analyses shall be performed at a laboratory designated by the director and the cost of these analyses shall be borne by the owner.
(j)
No statement contained in this section shall be constructed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial, commercial or other owner from whose premises an industrial-commercial or domestic waste emanates which is of unusual strength or character from being accepted by the department for treatment subject to approval by applicable state and federal agencies and to payment therefore by such owner.
(k)
Wastewater from any building sewer entering a public sewer, which is either domestic or nondomestic in nature but having a concentration of a given wastewater constituent higher than the defined normal standard, shall cause the user to be subject to a surcharge based on the following formula:
Cs = [Bc (B) + Sc (S) + Pc (P)]Vu
Where:
EXPAND
Cs = A surcharge for wastewaters of excessive strength
Bc = Operation and maintenance (O & M) cost for treatment of a unit of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) $19,682/175,036 lbs./yr. $0.112/lb.
B = Concentration of BOD from a user above a base level of 300 mg/l (in pounds per 1,000 gallons)
Sc = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of suspended solids (SS) $6,356/129,374 lbs./yr. $0.049/lb.
S = Concentration of SS from a user above a base level of 350 mg/l (in pounds per 1,000 gallons)
Pc = O & M cost for treatment of a unit of any pollutant (in dollars/lb.)
P = Concentration of any pollutant from a user above a base level. The base level shall be determined by the average discharge of thepollutants by residential users.
Vu = Volume contributed by a user per unit of time (in 1,000 gallons per month).
  Therefore:
Cs = [$0.112/lb. (B) + $0.049/lb. (S) + Pc (P)] Vu
The department shall take 24-hour proportional composite samples of a user's sewage discharge to determine concentration levels of B, S and P and to determine a pattern of surcharges. Thereafter, the department may periodically take additional samples for the purpose of adjusting the surcharges. The user may request additional sampling and testing and obtain same provided the user bears the expense.

Sec. 86-170. - Definitions.
The following words are to be understood consistent with the definitions contained herein as applicable to this article.
(a)
Emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life, health, or property; the interruption of utility services; or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action.
(b)
Extraordinary circumstances means circumstances other than normal operating conditions which exist and make it impractical or impossible for a facility owner or operator to comply with the provisions of this article. Such extraordinary circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice and snow, and acts of God.
( Ord. No. 0-15-15, art. I , 8-6-15)
Sec. 86-171. - White lining.
(a)
Background. White lining is a practice that has been widely used in the United States where the National Transportation Board concluded that pre-marking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage. The procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated, such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where. White lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately. In short, pre-marking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate.
(c)
Examples; timing. Examples of areas to be white lined are smaller (involving only a portion of a particular address) or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines, service lines (such as for water, gas, electricity and sewer), utility pits, cuts and repairs, curb repairs, bore holes, directional boring pathways, pole and signage placements, etc. Such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive. White lining shall be completed prior to contacting GA811 to obtain a locate request ticket number. Electronic/virtual white lining shall be clearly marked on submitted documentation within a 20-foot tolerance zone of the proposed excavation site.
(d)
Exceptions to white lining. Exceptions are allowed as follows:
(1)
For large projects as defined in O.C.G.A § 25-9-3(18), unless one or more utility facilities are damaged three times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90-day contract period, white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with GSPC Rule 515-9-4-13 (a copy of GPSC Rule 515-9-4-13 currently in effect is attached as Exhibit "A" and by reference is incorporated herein). Every contractor begins each large project with zero damages. It is only when three damages (at-fault damages) occur during the 90-day period of the specific large project that the white lining requirement will be triggered. A large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt, as stated above, will be subject to no more than a two-day shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the large project marking facility locating agreement schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon;
(2)
Homeowners/occupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel. Homeowners/occupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business, a contractor, or a utility. Businesses, contractors, and utilities are not exempt from white lining;
(3)
"Emergencies" and "extraordinary circumstances" as such terms are defined herein, are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and, hence, also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section. However, if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance, then the excavator's failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section. Also, pre-excavation emergency locate ticket requests (that is, a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit) will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section;
(4)
Residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential address/parcel requests only; and
(5)
Termite baiting systems.
(e)
White lining symbols as directions to locator. White lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines and/or arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated "START" and "END" of such linear white line. Therefore, it is important to identify the starting and ending points.
(f)
Identification of white lining excavator. In order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process, such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavator's name or the applicable locate ticket number or both.

Sec. 86-172. - Facility marking by or for utilities.
(a)
Utility markings. Facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their UPC alpha code, along with the type material (if known) that the facility consists of, at the beginning and end of locates. Also, arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues. In accomplishing the locate task, the line locator shall use industry-approved and generally accepted methods of locating. The tolerance zone shall be 18 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities.
(1)
To avoid confusion on long runs, the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner.
(2)
The marks shall indicate the approximate center-line of the underground lines. For example, the middle of the cable, line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks.
(3)
Location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet. If the facility to be marked has a greater diameter than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches.
(4)
The line locator (person marking the lines) shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area.
(5)
In areas such as flower beds, rock gardens, etc., flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint. The decision to use flags, paint, or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions. For instance, flags or stakes in wet areas, offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks.
(6)
Dead ends, stub-outs, termination points, etc., shall be marked as follows:
(7)
Lines that have connections (e.g., T's or Y's) or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated. Marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection. Marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy.
(8)
Manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible (dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover).
(9)
Facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner.
(10)
Unlocatable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and, if the location of the tap for such unlocatable sewer lateral is known, by placing a green "T" or "Y" or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocatable sewer lateral.
(11)
When facilities share the same trench, they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified. This would apply to lines that share the same color code. For example, cable television and telephone lines:
(12)
If the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If the size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches.
(13)
Duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot.
(14)
In areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed, offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface. However, offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility. Offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark. For example, the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow.
(15)
In areas where cables are spliced, the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice. When the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with "SP" should indicate the area of distortion or "splice pit".
