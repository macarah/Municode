Former article II, §§ 86-31—86-34, 86-51—86-64, 86-81—86-85, 86-101—86-105, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 98-C, 2-5-2015; Ord. No. 98-D, 4-13-2017.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 86-31. - Purpose.
The intent of this article is to provide a uniform standard for the protection and replacement of trees on all real property that requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit, as referenced in the Forsyth County Unified Development Code, within the unincorporated areas of Forsyth County.
The county recognizes the importance of trees, which sustain and enhance quality of life, health and economic development of the community. Tree conservation and planting enhancement contributes positive impacts toward stormwater runoff, environmental health, air quality and property values as well as offering protection for environmentally sensitive areas.

(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.3, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-54. - Permit review procedures.
The department of planning and community development administers the Forsyth County Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance. The county arborist is the primary tree plan reviewer and is responsible for making professional judgments regarding any arboricultural principles or practices related to the implementation of this article.
(a)
Pre-submittal conference. Developers and design professionals are encouraged to meet with the county arborist and/or other department of planning and community development professional staff prior to submitting a tree protection and/or replacement plan. The county arborist is available for field inspections of site conditions prior to submittal to give advice as to the relative value of trees, and to assist in the tree protection and/or replacement plan development process as it relates to preserving trees. Information can also be disseminated about how to prepare a tree protection and/or replacement plan.
(b)
Land disturbance permit. Tree protection and/or replacement plans shall be submitted with other permit drawings as part of the plan approval and/or land disturbance permit process as required in the Unified Development Code. The department of planning and community development shall review these plans for conformance with the tree protection and replacement ordinance in the manner specified in the Unified Development Code.
(c)
Clearing, grading and development activities shall conform in all respects with the approved tree preservation and/or tree replacement Plan. If any revisions to the plans occur that affect the clearing and grading limits, changes must be reflected in a subsequently submitted permit application and shown on a revised and approved tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan prior to the commencement of changed activities on site.
(d)
A post development tree survey shall be submitted and approved prior to issuance of a final plat or as-built for residential uses located on property of at least ten acres excluding mixed use zoning districts.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.4, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-55. - Tree protection and/or replacement plan standards.
The following section establishes standards by which plans and field conditions are to be evaluated to determine compliance with the Forsyth County Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance.
(a)
Protection of existing trees. If trees are existing on the site, the required density (see section 86-61) should be met with those trees. If this cannot be done, replacement trees are required. A tree protection and/or replacement plan must be a part of the approved land disturbance plan (refer to section 86-56 for specific requirements of a tree protection and/or replacement plan).
When a choice is available as to which existing trees to save, significant trees, even isolated individual trees, should be given preference over other trees. Non-significant trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site.
(b)
Tree protection and grading. Site work allowed pursuant to an approved land disturbance permit shall be coordinated to protect significant trees and tree groupings. Efforts shall be taken to minimize changes to natural grade to preserve existing trees by avoiding impacts to the established CRZ.
(c)
Tree inventories and surveys. All trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried. Significant trees must be shown on the tree protection and/or replacement plan with an indication whether they are to be retained or removed. Approximate locations are acceptable.
(d)
Plan review standards.
(1)
All tree save areas must be delineated on the tree protection and/or replacement plan along with a designation whether protection during construction is to be active or passive as set forth in section 34-81(a).
(2)
The method used to inventory the trees must be indicated on the plans.
(3)
All buffers must be identified on the tree protection and/or replacement plan.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.5, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-56. - Tree replacement standards.
The following section establishes standards by which tree protection and/or replacement plans and field conditions are to be evaluated to determine compliance with the Forsyth County Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance.
Tree protection and/or replacement plans shall be prepared with appropriate consideration given to the function of trees in the landscape. Every effort should be made to maximize the environmental benefit of the plant material.
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability.
(a)
Criteria for replacement trees.
(1)
Spacing and the potential size of species chosen shall be compatible with spatial limitations of the site.
(2)
The species must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site.
(3)
Trees must be replaced with at least 60 percent overstory species.
(4)
The tree must be compatible in extent of crown and root systems at maturity with nearby utilities.
(5)
Where trees must be added to achieve the SDF, pines may not comprise more than 40 percent of the required units. Where existing pines already comprise more than 40 percent of the required units, no more pines may be credited toward the required units. This limitation applies to replacement planting only; existing pines may comprise 100 percent of the existing density factor.
(6)
No more than 40 percent of the replacement trees can be composed of any one genus.
(7)
In order for replacement trees to qualify toward the density credits, overstory trees shall be a minimum caliper of two inches and 12 feet in height. All understory trees shall be a minimum caliper of two inches and eight feet in height.
(b)
Species. Species selected as replacement trees must be quality species and must be ecologically compatible with the intended-growing Site.
Ornamental and columnar form trees are acceptable for use in meeting density requirements only with prior approval from the county arborist and only for the replacement of understory trees.
(c)
Minimum root zones. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the following minimum criteria must be observed for replacement trees:
Large trees: 400 sq. ft. of pervious root zone minimum.
Small trees: 100 sq. ft. of pervious root zone minimum.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.6, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-57. - Significant trees.
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection. These trees are referred to as significant trees. Significant trees are composed of specimen, landmark and historic tree, or any tree deemed by the county arborist, a registered forester or a registered landscape architect to be of a rare or unusual species. Criteria for determining specimen, historic, and landmark trees can be found below:
Size Criteria for Specimen Trees.
EXPAND
SPECIMEN TREES SIZE CRITERIA
Overstory Hardwood Trees 18-inch DBH
Pine, Poplar and Sweetgum Trees 25-inch DBH
Understory/Small Trees 8-inch DBH
  To obtain credit as a significant tree, significant trees are to be protected in their natural state, free from damage. In order to encourage the protection of significant trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for significant trees that are successfully saved. Credit for any significant tree saved will be four times the assigned unit value shown in Table A, section 86-61 "Trees to Remain on Site (Existing)."
Significant trees that need to be removed require a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for removal to be submitted to the department of planning and community development prior to the removal. Significant trees removed with prior approval from the department of planning and community development must be replaced at the rate of one unit for each unit awarded it in Table A, section 86-61, in addition to the minimum site density factor in recompense for their removal. Significant trees must be replaced by species with similar characteristics. For commercial and industrial zoning districts, significant tree recompence will not exceed 30.0 units/acre.
(a)
Condition criteria for specimen trees. The county arborist will determine if a tree qualifies as a specimen tree using the following criteria:
(1)
All specimen trees are to have a sound trunk, with less than 20 percent radial trunk dieback.
(2)
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
(3)
No major insect or pathological problems.
(4)
Life expectancy of 15+ years for hardwoods, 8+ years for pines.
(5)
Smaller trees can be considered specimen trees if rare or of unusual quality, species or historical significance.
(6)
Specimen tree stands as defined in section 86-33.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.7, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-58. - Removal of significant trees.
If a specimen, historic or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior approval by the county arborist, recompense or penalty will be required or imposed as follows:
(a)
Any specimen tree that is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the county arborist must be replaced by trees with a total density unit value equal to four times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum of three-inch caliper trees.
(b)
If a historic or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior approval of the county arborist, the department of planning and community development will require replacement by trees with a total density equal to eight times the unit value of the tree removed.
(c)
In the event the county arborist determines a specimen, historic or landmark tree is a hazard to property, power lines, or people the tree may be removed without recompense or penalty.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.8, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-59. - Special requirements.
modified
The following classifications will be required to comply with these special requirements in addition to the standard requirements of this article.
(a)
Residential zoning district.
(1)
The site density factor for development in residential zoning districts shall be met by preserving or replacing trees in common areas, rear and exterior setbacks, and other areas that are not to be disturbed during house construction.
(2)
Each detached single-family residential lot shall contain a minimum of two trees, at least one of which must be located in the front yard. Corner lots shall contain a minimum of three trees with at least one tree located in each yard abutting the streets. The required trees must be a minimum of two-inch caliper size and be an overstory hardwood species. Where planting space is limited or an overstory tree would not be compatible with the intended growing site, the use of understory species may be approved on a case by case basis as determined by the county arborist. Existing or replacement trees may be used to satisfy this requirement. The trees may be counted toward the required site density factor for the project.
(3)
Common areas in new, major subdivisions and future phases of existing, major subdivisions shall preserve or provide 15 overstory trees per acre. Preserved healthy overstory trees over 16-inch dbh can count for three newly planted overstory trees, as approved by the county arborist.
(b)
Commercial and industrial zoning districts subdivisions. Subdivisions in commercial and industrial zoning districts require the site density factor to be shown on the as built. At the time of site development, each lot must submit a tree protection and/or replacement plan indicating compliance with the tree protection and replacement ordinance. Specimen tree liability shall be assessed against the entire development on a prorated per lot basis.
(c)
Protection of boundary trees and trees on adjoining properties. In order to protect boundary trees and trees on adjoining property, the tree protection and/or replacement plan shall show all trees within 25 feet of the property line that are eight inches dbh and greater, along with the critical root zone (CRZ) of each such tree. The limits of disturbance on the subject property shall be adjusted so that there is no land disturbance, other than the minimum necessary for utility installation and maintenance, within the CRZ of each such street. In lieu of identifying each such tree, the area of protection may be identified along the property line where trees exist on the adjoining property. The maximum area of protection is 25 feet from the property line. Notwithstanding the area of protection requirements of this subsection, the area of protection described herein is not required along the internal lot lines of a multi-parcel development approved under a single zoning application located in a commercial or industrial zoning district. In the event of a conflict between this section and any other language in the Code of Forsyth County, Georgia, including the Unified Development Code, that would otherwise allow land-disturbing activity prohibited by this section, this section shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.9, 5-6-2021; Ord. No. 98-F , § 1(Exh. A), 3-3-2022)
Sec. 86-60. - Location of trees within a development other than single family development.
Forsyth County has given priority to the retention and placement of trees in frontage planting strips and parking lot planting islands. Trees retained or placed in these areas may be used to meet the site density factor for a project. However, if the site density factor is met with trees saved or planted in other areas, the tree location guidelines outlined below must still be performed with additional tree plantings.
(a)
Frontage planting strips. Planting strips shall meet the minimum depth requirements as indicated in the following table. Trees equivalent to at least one tree density unit (see section 86-61) for every 75 linear feet of length shall be saved or planted in such strips (trees may be planted in groups rather than in a single line). Any trees placed between the right-of-way line or utility easement and the construction area (the buildings, accessory uses, or parking area) may be considered to be in the planting strips. (See Appendix A, Detail 1 - Frontage Planting Strips)
EXPAND
Zoning District Depth of Strip Adjoining Street right-of-way or easement (feet)
Multi Family Residential 20
Commercial 10

  (b)
Landscape islands. Landscape islands shall be provided within parking areas (but not within vehicle storage, maneuvering, or display areas) as follows:
(1)
Landscape islands shall be located at the end of every parking bay and at every 150 linear feet of continuous parking space. Measuring from the trunk, the tree must be a minimum of six feet from the back of the curb. No portion of an island less than three feet in width may be counted in the area. Landscape islands for single parking bays shall contain a minimum of 200 square feet. Landscape islands for double parking bays shall require a minimum of two 200-square-foot islands or one continuous landscape island of 400 square feet.
(2)
Landscape islands shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the parking area. A planting area, which intrudes upon or is located wholly within a generally rectangular area that is (a) devoted to parking and (b) between a building and a lot line or between two buildings will generally serve this purpose.
(3)
At least one overstory tree shall be planted in every landscape island.
(4)
Method of irrigation shall be indicated on the tree protection and/or replacement plan.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.10, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-61. - Tree density requirements.
The site density factor shall be calculated using the total acreage from disturbed areas. Replacement trees should be distributed throughout the development and not located in only one area.
The quantity of total existing and replacement trees on a site must be sufficient so as to produce a total site density factor of no less than:
(1)
Disturbed acreage multiplied by 20 tree density units for single-family residential zoned property.
(2)
Disturbed acreage multiplied by 15 tree density units for commercial, mixed use, industrial and all other non-single-family zoned property.
The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the following formula:
Site Density Factor (SDF) = Exiting Density Factor (EDF) + Replacement Density Factor (RDF)
Site Density Factor (SDF): The SDF is calculated by multiplying the disturbed area by the multiplier established in subsections (1) and (2) above based on the zoning of the property and adding any required significant tree recompense.
Existing Density Factor (EDF): The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to remain on the site to tree density units. The density factor conversion table for existing trees is shown in Table A below, "Trees Remaining on Site (Existing)."
Replacement Density Factor (RDF): The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. The tree density unit conversion table for replacement (new) trees is shown in Table B below, "Replacement Tree Table".
Trees within buffers. Existing significant trees located within a required zoning buffer area may be included in the existing density factor if the entire CRZ is protected. However, non-significant trees, or significant trees that are not fully protected, may not be counted toward the existing density factor. Existing trees (excluding significant trees located within required zoning buffers) to be retained in order to meet buffer requirements as required in the Unified Development Code will not be considered in the existing density factor. Replacement trees in required buffer areas may count towards the replacement density factor only under the following circumstances:
(a)
Buffer (zoning or state waters) does not have existing tree cover or is sparsely vegetated with trees prior to land disturbance; or
(b)
Tree replacement is required by zoning condition(s) that necessitate buffer (zoning or state waters) disturbance for tree installation.
In either circumstance noted above, buffers would remain undisturbed except for replacement tree installation or any disturbance required to comply with a condition of zoning.
EXAMPLE:
1.
A commercial site with 7.5 acres of disturbed area and no significant trees removed would result in a site density factor of 112.5 tree density units, calculated as follows:
7.5 acres × 15 tree density units = 112.5 SDF
2.
A total of 13 trees will remain on the 7.5-acre site. The tree count is as follows:
7 - 12" diameter pines
3 - 14" diameter pines
3 - 18" diameter oaks
3.
Converting diameters (DBH) to tree density units, the EDF is determined below (see Table A):
EXPAND
DBH Units No. of Trees Total
12" 2.4 x 7 16.8
14" 3.3 x 3 9.9
**18" 5.4 x 3 64.8
EDF     91.5
  **See division 2, section 86-62, significant trees for explanation of specimen tree credits.
4.
The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
RDF = 112.5 - 91.5 = 21
5.
A total of 21 replacement tree density units are required.

Sec. 86-62. - Exclusions from tree density acreage.
modified
(a)
Areas within public utility easements which contain petroleum, gas, electric transmission easements or major sanitary sewer mains (eight inches or greater), and water mains (16 inches or greater) shall be excluded from the total acreage of the property when calculating the required tree density provided that no proposed improvements (building, parking lots, roadways) are within the easement.
(b)
Public athletic field and trails shall be excluded from the disturbed area of the property when calculating the required site density factor calculations.
(c)
Building footprint aggregates greater than 30,000 square feet in size that are located in industrial zoning districts shall be excluded from site density factor calculations.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.12, 5-6-2021; Ord. No. 98-F , § 1(Exh. A), 3-3-2022)
Sec. 86-63. - Additional credits.
(a)
Additional tree density units will be granted under the following:
(1)
Existing trees to be preserved on slopes greater than ten percent will receive an additional bonus credit of 50 percent of the unit amount as defined in this division.
(2)
In major subdivisions, tree groupings connected with a continuous drip line will receive an additional bonus credit of 50 percent of the earned credit when such tree groupings are not located within or adjacent to an identified buffer.
(b)
If excess existing density factor (EDF) units remain above and beyond the required site density factor (SDF), these excess units may be applied toward required specimen tree replacement units.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.13, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-64. - Alternative compliance.
Where the minimum density requirements cannot be fully met, due to site conditions, the applicant must have the approval of the director, to contribute to the Tree Replacement Fund of Forsyth County. Such contributions will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property. Contributions to the tree replacement fund must be paid in full prior to the issuance of any permit.
The tree replacement fund is to act as an "emergency relief valve" and is to be utilized at the county's discretion. When it has been determined the required site density factor cannot be met with residual or planted trees, a contribution equal to $750.00 per unit for each unit short of the requirement must be paid into the tree replacement fund by the developer.
For commercial or industrial zoning districts, the applicant may count significant tree replacement unit credit for trees to be planted in the subject property's side or rear buffer, if required as a condition of zoning. The applicant may also request to plant trees within the public right of way or on public property within one mile of the subject property; this method of offsite planting compliance may be allowed at the county's discretion based upon the feasibility of plant material installation on public property within the distance specified above. If off-site planting as described in this section is approved, an indemnification agreement must be executed requiring on-going maintenance of the landscaped area by the applicant and all subsequent owners of the subject property.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 2.14, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-65. - Maintenance period for development in commercial, mixed use and industrial zoning districts.
Trees used to meet the density requirements, shall be maintained for one full growing season after the date of final inspection. After one full growing season a maintenance inspection will be performed by the county arborist to determine if the project is still in compliance with the tree protection and replacement ordinance. Any trees planted to meet the required site density requirement, which are dead or near death must be replaced. Trees protected to meet the required site density which are dead or near death at the time of the maintenance inspection must be replaced if there is evidence that the demise of such trees was due to an act or omission that caused the tree to deteriorate.
Any trees required to be replaced by this inspection must be planted within 30 days of receipt of notification by the current owner(s). New tree plantings may be postponed for up to six months by posting a performance security (see section 86-101). Failure to plant new trees in accordance with these provisions will constitute a violation of this article and will subject the property owner to civil penalties as set forth in this article.

Secs. 86-66—86-80. - Reserved.
DIVISION 3. - METHODS/TECHNICAL STANDARDS

Sec. 86-81. - Construction standards for tree protection devices.
Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including but not limited to:
(1)
Soil compaction in the critical root zone from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials;
(2)
Root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching;
(3)
Wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs;
(4)
Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc.
(a)
Location and types of tree protection devices. Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the tree protection and/or replacement plan or otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone of all trees to be preserved. Active protection is required where tree save areas are located in proximity to construction activity. Passive protection may be used in more remote locations and in all tree protection areas not designated as tree save areas as determined by the county arborist. Once tree protection areas are established and approved, any changes are subject to department of planning and community development review.
(b)
Materials.
(1)
Active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post, rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material (See Detail 3—Active Tree Protection).
(2)
Passive protection shall consist of heavy mill plastic flagging of a bright color or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint sufficient to delineate the bounds of any tree protection or save areas (See Detail 2—Passive Tree Protection).
(c)
Sequence of installation and removal. All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any land-disturbing activity. The department of planning and community development will inspect the installation of tree protection devices. It shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner and/or developer to ensure that all tree protection devices remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. In the event passive tree protection is not kept in functioning condition, active tree protection may be required throughout the project.
(d)
Other specifications.
(1)
Where clearing has been approved, trees shall be removed in a manner that does not adversely impact the trees to be preserved. Avoid felling trees into tree protection areas or disturbing roots inside the tree protection areas.
(2)
All erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be installed so that sediment will not accumulate within the tree protection areas.
(3)
All tree protection areas shall be designated as such with "tree protection area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with the tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 3.1, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-82. - Standards for transplanting.
Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication, "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual" or similar publication. Reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60,l) for plant material quality specifications. Reference the "Manual for Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael A. Dirr) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements.
(a)
Tree planting standards.
(1)
Always pick a tree up by the container or root ball, never by the trunk.
(2)
The hole should be a minimum of one and one-half times the width of the root ball with sloped sides.
(3)
The depth of the hole should be no deeper than the height between the bottom of the root ball and the trunk flare.
(4)
Once the tree is placed in the hole, the burlap and wire basket must be removed a minimum of 12 inches from the top of the root ball.
(5)
Backfill soil should not be amended.
(6)
Stake only if necessary.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 3.2, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-83. - Standards for pruning.
All pruning shall be done in accordance with ANSI A300 (part 1) "Standards for tree care operations - Pruning". Tree topping is not allowed. Crown reduction pruning must be used instead.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 3.3, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-84. - Standards for tree placement and maintenance.
Proper tree placement and appropriate maintenance are critical components to the establishment and maintenance of healthy trees. The following requirements must be met with respect to plantings conducted pursuant to the requirements of this Ordinance in order to enhance longevity of installed trees as they mature in the landscape so that they may continue to provide environmental and visual benefits.
(a)
In order to provide adequate growing area and soil volume for planted trees, the following minimum criteria must be observed unless trees are to be located within parking lot landscape islands or as otherwise approved by the county arborist to improve the viability of the planted trees:
(1)
Minimum open soil surface area with average soil depths greater than or equal to three feet:
Overstory trees: 400 square feet.
Understory trees: 100 square feet.
(2)
Minimum setbacks from exterior of trunk to buildings:
Overstory trees: 20 feet.
Understory trees: 10 feet.
(3)
Minimum setbacks from exterior of trunk to sidewalks, driveways, and other impervious surfaces:
Overstory trees: 8 feet.
Understory trees: 4 feet.
(b)
In some situations, certain conditions or constraints, such as but not limited to existing or proposed utilities, infrastructure, streams, wetlands or other environmental factors, may limit the ability of a site to support the minimum number of required trees. The county arborist may approve and/or require alternative planting locations or other means of compliance for fulfilling the planting requirement for any tree required by the tree ordinance, UDC, or other development regulations. Such decisions shall be based on established principles and practices of arboriculture and with consideration to maximizing the tree's health and contribution to the landscape and environment in order to fulfill the purpose and intent of this article.
(c)
Plant trees in locations where limbs will not impede access for delivery or emergency vehicles.
(d)
Street trees should be pruned to provide at least eight feet of vertical clearance under branches to avoid hazards created by low branches. Prune tree regularly to maintain pedestrian and vehicular clearances and reduce the potential for damage or vandalism.
(e)
Use a variety of species to reduce susceptibility to disease.
(f)
Consider the use of pervious pavements and soil systems such as silva cells or structural soil to increase soil volumes and moisture penetration
(g)
Consider the installation of root barriers along curbs, sidewalks, and tree wells to reduce potential damage to the pavement.
(h)
Where possible, locate trees such that conflicts with utilities are minimized, including both underground utilities and overhead power lines.
(i)
Consider providing irrigation or methods to provide regular watering to tree planting areas during the plant establishment period to ensure the survival of new trees and improve overall tree health and longevity.

DIVISION 4. - ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES

Sec. 86-101. - Performance security.
When planting stock availability is low or weather conditions are not appropriate for planting new trees, the project owner may postpone planting for up to six months, provided that performance security is posted with Forsyth County in accordance with the following criteria:
(a)
Security shall be in an approved form submitted to the department of planning and community development with appropriate documentation of stock availability and weather conditions.
(b)
Security shall be in an amount equal to 150 percent of the cost of materials, installation, and guarantee, as demonstrated by a signed contract between the owner and a landscape contractor and approval by department of planning and community development.
An inspection shall be made by the department of planning and community development of all tree plantings to assure compliance with plan requirements prior to release of the performance security. Forsyth County will use the performance security at the time of expiration if the planting requirements have not been fulfilled, or if the owner has not requested an extension. Funds received from the performance security will be used to bring the project into compliance. One six-month extension is permitted with documented justification. Any inspections performed after the final inspection (for project release) are subject to re-inspection fee schedules, which shall be maintained on file at the department of planning and community development.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 4.1, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-102. - Inspection.
The county arborist may periodically inspect the project during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following the completion of work. Applicants shall cooperate with the department of planning and community development in making such inspections. The department of planning and community development shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for the purpose of entering at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activities.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized county employee who request entry for the purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any Person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
Prior to any land-disturbing activity, department of planning and community development must inspect all tree protection devices for compliance with the tree protection and/or replacement plan. Failure to adhere to tree protection and/or replacement plan will subject the project to enforcement procedures found in this article.
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, final plat, or other forms of county acceptance, the department of planning and community development shall inspect for compliance with all tree protection and/or replacement ordinance requirements. Any disturbances in tree save areas or deficiencies in the required site density factor will be cited at this time. tree save area deficiencies must be corrected with new tree plantings prior to project release.
Existing trees, which are not expected to survive, will not be counted toward meeting density requirements. Conversely, any existing trees not shown to remain on plans but which have been saved (meeting all tree protection standards) through field adjustments may be counted toward density requirements, provided that all changes are recorded.
Once a tree save area has been established through the department of planning and community development plan approval process, any destruction of trees in that area must be mitigated by planting new trees to a density factor of 60 units per acre. A revised tree protection and/or replacement plan must be submitted and approved by the department of planning and community development.
(Ord. No. 98-E, § 4.2, 5-6-2021)
Sec. 86-103. - Remedial care.
Trees in tree save areas, which have been adversely impacted by the construction process, may be subject to remedial care. Remedial care will be performed at the discretion of the county arborist and may include (but is not limited to) the following:
• Pruning
• Soil Aeration
• Fertilization
• Supplemental Watering

(a)
If it is determined that a person has engaged in land-disturbing activities and has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be posted on site. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this ordinance within three days after such notice of non-compliance has been issued shall result in immediate issuance of a stop work order. Where any emergency exists, as determined by the director, no written notice shall be required before a stop work order is issued.
(b)
Any person violating any provision of this article, approved tree protection and/or replacement plan, or stop-work order shall be subject to issuance of a magistrate court citation, which may result in a fine up to $1,000.00 per violation. Regarding tree violations, a violation shall be considered an individual removed and/or damaged tree. Each calendar day a violation exists shall be considered a separate offence. There is no maximum to the accrual of fines. All fines will be deposited into the Tree Replacement Fund of Forsyth County.
In addition to or in lieu of any magistrate court action or civil penalty, the department of planning and community development shall require the replacement of trees by the person violating this article in order to meet the minimum requirements set out herein.
