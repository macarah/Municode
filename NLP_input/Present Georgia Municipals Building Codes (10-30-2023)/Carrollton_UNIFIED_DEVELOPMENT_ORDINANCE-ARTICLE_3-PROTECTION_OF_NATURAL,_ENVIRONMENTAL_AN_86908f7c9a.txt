Editor's note— Res. No. 09-2011, adopted Sept. 12, 2011, repealed the former Sec. 3.01.00, §§ 3.01.01—3.01.22, and enacted a new Sec. 3.01.00 as set out herein. The former Sec. 3.01.00 pertained to flood damage prevention. This Sec. 3.01.00 bore no history note.

3.01.01 - Statutory Authorization
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Carrollton of Carroll County, Georgia, does ordain as follows:
(Res. No. 09-2011, 9-12-11)
3.01.02 - Findings of Fact
A.
The flood hazard areas of Carrollton, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
B.
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Res. No. 09-2011, 9-12-11)
3.01.03 - Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
B.
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
C.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
D.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
E.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Res. No. 09-2011, 9-12-11)
3.01.04 - Objectives
The objectives of this ordinance are:
A.
To protect human life and health;
B.
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
C.
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
D.
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
E.
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
F.
To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
G.
To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

B.
The Mayor and City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain Coordinator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
C.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Mayor and City Council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Carroll County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
D.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
E.
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this ordinance are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
F.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
G.
In reviewing such requests, the Mayor and City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance and the following:
a.
Danger that material may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b.
Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c.
Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
d.
Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e.
Necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
f.
Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
g.
Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h.
Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
i.
Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
j.
Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
k.
Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
H.
Conditions for Variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is:
i.
A finding of good and sufficient cause,
ii.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and
iii.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
b.
The provisions of this Ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The Floodplain Coordinator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
I.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Mayor and City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.

(Res. No. 09-2011, 9-12-11)
3.02.00 - WATER RESOURCE DISTRICTS

3.02.01 - Purpose
The intent of this article is to establish minimum development standards and criteria, which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the City. Based on the findings of the City Comprehensive Plan, it has been determined that the wise management of these resources as defined in this article is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well being of the public.
3.02.02 - Establishment of Water Resource Districts
A.
The water resource districts shall include the following:
1.
Groundwater recharge area district;
2.
Wetlands district;
3.
Water supply watershed district; and
4.
River corridor protection district.
B.
The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as water resource districts and are included as part of this article which are on file with the City Manager's office located at 315 Bradley Street, Carrollton, Georgia.
C.
These water resource districts are established measures to guide future growth and development in environmentally sensitive areas. Because these protective measures allow some latitude with land uses and because these districts are not intended to prescribe a specific land use but rather to define the range of acceptable land uses, these districts are designated as overlay districts.
3.02.03 - Definitions
Definitions for the following section are located in Article 1 of this UDO.
3.02.04 - Groundwater Recharge Area District
A.
Findings of fact.
1.
Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities.
2.
Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water.
3.
Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces.
4.
Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
B.
Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
C.
District delineation.
1.
The groundwater recharge area districts are hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the state Department of Natural Resources in "Most Significant Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)."
2.
In addition, each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility rating of high, medium, or low based on the "Ground-water Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992."
3.
Said maps are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
4.
Standards for this district shall comply with the DNR Rule 391-3-16-.02, Criteria for the Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas.
3.02.05 - Protection Criteria and Permitted Uses
A.
All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district.
B.
The following are additional requirements for specific uses in the groundwater recharge area protection district:
1.
All new above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have the secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
2.
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
a.
A high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 4.9 million gallons (15 acre/feet) in size; and
c.
A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 16.3 million gallons (50 acre/feet) in size.
d.
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10-7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly known as the U.S. Soil Conservation Service).
3.
All private wastewater facilities, including privies, cesspools, and septic tanks, are prohibited in all areas where public sewers are available as established in the City's sewer use ordinance, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this article by reference. The ordinance requires that all owners of houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes situated within the City's jurisdiction and abutting on any street, alley, or right of way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of the City is hereby required at the owner's expense to install suitable toilet facilities herein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of the sewer use ordinance, within thirty (30) days after date of official notice to do so, provided that said sewer is within 100 feet of the property line.
4.
An exception to the sewer use ordinance is made for the estate residential district (ER) established in this ordinance, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this article by reference. In the ER district the following use is provided: new single-family residences, except mobile homes and modular homes, shall have a minimum lot size of three (3) acres with provisions for on-site sewage disposal permitted with a permit from the county health department prior to installation.
5.
Lots of record approved prior to the adoption of the sewer use ordinance are hereby exempt from the requirements of (3) and (4) of this section; however, if said private waste water facilities fail, these properties will be required to connect to the City's sanitary sewer system.
6.
No construction shall proceed on any residence, within the ER district, unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank as meeting the requirements of the state Department of Human Resources "Manual for On-Site Sewage Management" (hereinafter DHR Manual), and subsection (3) and (4) of this section.
7.
New facilities which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks, in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operation on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention requirements.
8.
Any new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner.
9.
Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.
3.02.06 - Wetlands District
A.
Findings of fact.
1.
The wetlands within the City are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations.
2.
In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreation opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the state.
3.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts.
4.
Piece meal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands.
5.
Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
B.
Purpose.
1.
The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
2.
This ordinance is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreation and aesthetic values.
3.
Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practical as determined through the permitting process.
C.
District delineation.
1.
These regulations shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the City.
2.
The wetland district overlay map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands, according to the 1987 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps.
3.
These maps shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands maps and are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
4.
The generalized wetlands maps do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended.
5.
No local government action under this ordinance relieves the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
D.
Wetland development permit requirements.
1.
No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the City.
2.
If the area proposed for development is located near or in close proximity to a wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the zoning administrator, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required.
3.
If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or a letter of permission is issued.
E.
Permitted uses.
The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. The activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual Section 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances:
1.
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in the Clean Water Act.
2.
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided the conservation or preservation does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit.
3.
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
4.
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
5.
Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state Department of Agriculture.
F.
Prohibited uses.
The following uses are prohibited in a wetland district:
1.
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
2.
Hazardous or sanitary landfills.
3.02.07 - Water Supply Watershed District
A.
Findings of fact.
1.
In order to provide for the health, safety, welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured.
2.
The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs.
3.
In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies.
B.
Purpose.
1.
The purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the City, which will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds.
2.
This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the City.
C.
District delineation.
The City's water supply watershed district is hereby designated, and shall comprise the land areas, which drain to the City's water supply intake on the Little Tallapoosa River. The ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven (7) miles upstream of the respective water supply intake define the boundary of this district. This district shall be further delineated and defined on the water resource district map of the City, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this article by reference. The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and boundaries shall be identified on the water resource district map:
1.
Existing large water supply watersheds. There are none at the present time.
2.
Existing small water supply watersheds. The Little Tallapoosa River Watershed from the City's intake, encompassing a 97 square mile area. An intake for the City is located on this river. This water supply watershed contains three (3) reservoirs (see the table below) either owned in whole or in part by the City, all of which are covered in City's DNR approved reservoir management plan dated June 1992. Because the three (3) reservoirs were placed in use at different times over the past forty (40) years, use restrictions and buffer requirements vary for each reservoir.

Sharpe's Creek Storage impoundment to supplement raw water supply requirements during low flow, drought periods. The City controls the lake and a 100-foot easement around the lake.

Carroll County enforces a 150-foot buffer.

Has been in use since 1992. Recreation for residence only.

No motors with open exhaust; however, gasoline motors are allowed with a permit from the City's parks, recreation, and cultural arts department.

Other restrictions listed in the reservoir management plan dated June 1992.
Lake Carroll Storage impoundment to supplement raw water supply requirements during low flow, drought periods as a last resort only. The City controls the lake and a small percentage of land for use as parkland and public docking. Has been in use since the mid-1960's.

The City currently and will continue to enforce a 25-foot buffer as mandated in the erosion and sedimentation control ordinance. Recreation for residence and the general public.

No motors with open exhaust; however, gasoline motors are allowed with a permit from the City's parks, recreation, and cultural arts department.
Other restrictions listed in the reservoir management plan dated June 1992.
Lake Buckhorn Storage impoundment to supplement raw water supply requirements during low flow, drought periods. The City controls the top 10 feet of water volume.

This was arranged through the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service in the mid-1960's.

Carroll County currently enforces a 25-foot buffer. The City does not own the reservoir land and does not exercise any regulations on the other uses of the reservoir.

Therefore, the City has no restrictions on the recreational uses of the reservoir and does not control a buffer strip around the reservoir.
  3.
Future water supply watersheds. There are no planned large or small future water supply watersheds at the present time within the City limits of the City.
D.
Permitted uses.
The following regulations shall apply to the Little Tallapoosa Water Supply Watershed, which is identified on the water resource district map. All uses, which are lawful at the time of adoption of this article, shall be allowed to continue as lawful land uses until such time as the use is abandoned, as defined in this UDO for nonconforming uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by this article and county ordinances, except those listed below in prohibited uses, are permitted in the water supply watershed district, subject to the following conditions and standards:
1.
Stream corridor criteria.
a.
The perennial stream corridors of the City's small water supply watershed, within a seven-mile radius upstream of the public drinking water supply intake and the water supply reservoirs, are protected by the following criteria:
1.
A natural buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 100 feet on both sides of all perennial streams as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback on both sides of all perennial streams as measured from the stream bank.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the setback area of subsection (1)(a)(2) above.
b.
The perennial stream corridors of the City's small water supply watershed, outside a seven-mile radius upstream of the public drinking water supply intake and the water supply reservoirs, are protected by the following criteria:
1.
A natural buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet on both sides of all perennial streams as measured from the stream banks.
2.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 75-foot setback on both sides of all perennial streams as measured from the stream bank.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the setback area of subsection (1)(b)(2) above.
2.
Reservoir management plan criteria.
a.
Prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the following recreational uses (swimming, fishing, boating, docks, and public access) are addressed in the City's DNR-approved reservoir management plan dated June 1992. These restrictions were developed to protect the water quality of the three reservoirs for drinking purposes while optimizing their recreational benefits.
b.
Because the three reservoirs were placed in use at different times over the past forty years, use restrictions and buffer requirements vary for each reservoir.
c.
All new reservoirs shall have a buffer for a distance of 150 feet from the reservoir boundary and shall have prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the recreational uses listed above, to protect the water quality for drinking purposes.
d.
At such time in the future, if the land use changes at Lake Carroll result in a more concentrated use of the lake, then the City will address imposing more restrictive recreational measures in order to continue to preserve the water quality of the reservoir.
3.
Small water supply watershed criteria.
The following criteria apply to all locations within the City's small water supply watershed.
a.
New sanitary landfills are allowed only if they have synthetic liners and leachate collection systems.
b.
New hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities are prohibited.
c.
The impervious surface area, including all public and private structures, utilities, or facilities, of the entire water supply watershed shall be limited to twenty-five (25%) percent, or existing use, whichever is greater.
d.
New facilities, which handle hazardous materials of certain types and in certain amounts as determined by the Department of Natural Resources, shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by the Department of Natural Resources.
E.
Exemptions.
The following uses are exempt from the stream corridor buffer and setback requirements if they meet the stipulated conditions:
1.
Utilities.

Utilities shall be located as far as reasonably possible from the stream bank and shall not impair the quality of the drinking water system.
b.
Utilities shall be installed and maintained without changing the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible.
2.
Forestry, agricultural and mining activities.
a.
Agricultural activities involving the planting and harvesting of crops are exempted if they conform to the best management practices established by the state Department of Agriculture and USDA.
b.
Forestry activities must conform to the best management practices established by the state forestry commission.
c.
Mining activities permitted by the Department of Natural Resources under the Surface Mining Act.
d.
The activity shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
3.03.00 - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION

3.03.01 - Generally
A.
Findings of fact.
1.
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in the state. These corridors are of vital importance to the state by helping to preserve the qualities, which make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation and a source of clean drinking water.
2.
River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
B.
Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Little Tallapoosa River as defined herein.
3.03.02 - Definitions
Definitions for the following title are located in Article 1 of this UDO.
3.03.03 - Establishment of the Little Tallapoosa River Corridor Protection District
A.
The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbanks, on each side of the river, usually marked by a break in slope.
B.
Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district.
C.
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the City's comprehensive plan.
D.
Any shift in the location of the protected river corridor after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next Comprehensive Plan review by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs.
1.
General protection criteria.
The standards and requirements in this article do not supercede those contained in the Metropolitan River Protection Act, the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act, and the Erosion Sedimentation Control Act. Within the Little Tallapoosa River corridor protection district the following shall be the general criteria used to protect this vital water resource:
a.
Construction within the buffer area is prohibited except as provided herein.
b.
A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained at all times in the river corridor, except as otherwise provided herein.
c.
The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity.
d.
Septic tank and septic tank drain fields are prohibited in the river corridor, except as expressly provided in general protection criteria, Section 3.02.05 of this article.
e.
Single-family dwellings including the usual appurtenances are permitted in the buffer area subject to the following conditions:
1.
The dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations.
2.
The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land, zoned estate residential ER, containing at least three acres. For purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river, (for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the river banks can not be counted towards the three acre minimum size).
3.
There shall be only one such dwelling on each three-acre or larger tract of land.
4.
A septic tank or tanks serving such dwelling may be located within the buffer area. However, septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area.

3.04.04 - Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Using Best Management Practices
A.
General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (B) and (C) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit.
B.
Minimum Requirements/BMPs.
1.
Best management practices as set forth in sections (B) and (C) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the City Engineer or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
2.
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres.
3.
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
4.
The City Engineer may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
5.
The Local Issuing Authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15. and 16., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
C.
Additional Requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land- disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
1.
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
2.
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
3.
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
4.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
5.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
6.
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
7.
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
8.
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
9.
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
10.
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
11.
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
12.
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
13.
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
14.
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section;
15.
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the City Engineer determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the City Engineer pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 5, pt. 6, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the City Engineer as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (1) Stream crossings for water lines; or (2) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
16.
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The City Engineer may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (1) Stream crossings for water lines; or (2) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
D.
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any City from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (B) and (C) of this section.
E.
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

3.05.26 - Designation of Historic Districts
A.
Criteria for Selection. A historic district is a geographically definable area, which contains buildings, structures, sites, objects, landscape features and works of art or a combination thereof, which conforms to the criteria for evaluation of the National Register of Historic Places as follows:
1.
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a.
That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or
b.
That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c.
That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
d.
That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
2.
Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the national register. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the following categories:
a.
A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance;
b.
A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event;
c.
A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other appropriate site or building directly associated with his productive life;
d.
A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events;
e.
A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived;
f.
A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own historical significance; or
g.
A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.
B.
Boundaries. Boundaries of a historic district shall be shown on the official Zoning Map of the City.
C.
Classification of properties. Individual properties within historic districts shall be classified as:
1.
Historic (contributes to the district);
2.
Nonhistoric (does not contribute but does not detract from the district);
3.
Intrusive (detracts from the district).
3.05.27 - Designation of Historic Properties
A.
Criteria for Selection. A historic property is a building, structure, site, object, work of art; including the adjacent area necessary for the proper appreciation or use thereof, deemed worthy of preservation and conforms to the criteria for evaluation of the National Register of Historic Places as set forth in section 3.05.26 (A) above.
B.
Location of record. The site of such historic project shall be shown on the official zoning map of the City.
3.05.28 - Form of Submission for Recommendation of Designation
A.
Any submission for recommendation to the City for designation of a historic district or property shall be in such form and documented to the extent as now or hereafter required for submission of such district or property to the state historic preservation office for consideration and recommendation for the same to be placed on the National Registry of Historic Places.
B.
This report must be submitted to the historic preservation section of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, 30 days prior to the public hearing on the designation, for their comments.
