--- (3) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 8261 , § 1, adopted Apr. 11, 2022, amended Art. 8-12-16 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. 8-12-16, §§ 8-12-16-010—8-12-16-070, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the Code of 1978, §§ 8-3141—8-3147; Ord. No. 5390, § 3, adopted Dec. 20, 1994; and Ord. No. 5575, adopted June 12, 1996.

8-12-16-010 - Purpose.
A.
This article is adopted based upon the following findings:
1.
The city council finds that persons and organizations visit private residential properties, as well as privately owned businesses, for the purposes of soliciting goods, wares, merchandise, or services.
2.
Some residents and business owners find these activities to be intrusive upon their privacy and a safety concern.
3.
The goal of protecting residents from fraud and crime and thereby promoting the safety and privacy of residences within the city is a legitimate, urgent, and substantial governmental interest.
4.
The city has a substantial and compelling interest in preventing fraudulent, exploitative and/or criminal activities which may result from unregulated solicitation.
5.
The city has a substantial and compelling interest in protecting individuals' safety and privacy by reasonably limiting the hours of solicitation and requiring permits in a content neutral manner.
6.
The city has a substantial and compelling interest in allowing individuals to determine their level of comfort with privacy and whether or not they want to be solicited.
7.
Noncommercial speech is entitled to broader protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution than commercial speech, affording the city greater flexibility in the reasonable regulation of commercial speech.
8.
All of these goals and interests may properly be served by this narrowly tailored regulation which requires solicitors to obtain a city-issued permit prior to soliciting within the city, reasonably limits the hours of activities and prohibits solicitation on residential properties bearing a posted sign prohibiting such activities.
B.
The purpose of this article is to balance free speech and expression with the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city.
C.
The requirement of registration hereinafter set out in no way grants the right, or an occupation tax certificate to conduct such a business within the city. The act of registering is to indicate to the city that such registrants intend to solicit or canvass from door-to-door subject to, and under the provisions of, and in strict accordance with this article.
(Ord. No. 8261 , 4/11/2022, § 1)

It is not meant to regulate solicitation for charitable, political, or other nonprofit purposes provided that all sales proceeds are the property of and used by the nonprofit organization.
