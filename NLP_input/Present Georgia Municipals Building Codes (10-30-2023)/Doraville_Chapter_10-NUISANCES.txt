Sec. 10-1. - Abatement generally.
(a)
Nuisance an offense. It shall be an offense, punishable by a fine, for a person to allow within the City any condition which creates a nuisance.
(b)
Proceedings to abate. All nuisances in and about the streets and public alleys shall be removed by the chief of police. Any nuisance may be removed upon the written complaint of any inhabitant of the City, which complaint shall set forth particularly the nature and location on the same and the person complained against. On such complaint being filed with the City Clerk, the City Clerk shall issue a summons to the person charged with maintaining such nuisance, requiring him to show cause before the City Council at the time therein specified, not more than ten (10) days hence, why the nuisance complained of should not be abated. Such notice shall be served by any City police officer on the person complained against at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing, by handing him or her a copy or leaving the same at his or her residence or place of business. At such hearing, the City Council shall hear evidence as to the facts, and pass such order as may be just. If the thing complained of is declared a nuisance, the order shall specify within what time it is to be abated by the defendant. If it is not abated by the time specified in the order, the City Clerk shall issue a writ directed to the chief of police ordering abatement of the nuisance.
(c)
Expense of abatement by City. Whenever the City shall abate a nuisance as provided in subsection (b), it shall be authorized to employ a force sufficient to abate such nuisance, and the total cost thereof shall be assessed against the person adjudged guilty of creating or maintaining the same and failing or refusing to abate the same. Such cost shall constitute a lien on the property of such person and shall be collected in the same manner as City taxes are collected on default of payment.
(d)
Provisions supplemental. The provisions of this section shall not preclude any abatement of nuisances in accordance with state law. The provisions of this section are supplemental to and not in place of state law provisions on the subject of abatement of nuisances.
