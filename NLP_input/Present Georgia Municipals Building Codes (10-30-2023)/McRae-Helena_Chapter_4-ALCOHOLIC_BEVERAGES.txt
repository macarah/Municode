Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell alcoholic beverages, the city license shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the city clerk or any municipal officer or body.

(e)
The city clerk shall revoke the licenses of any licensee whose license has been suspended three or more times in any consecutive 12-month period.

The city clerk shall revoke the license for any premises where alcoholic beverages have been sold or distributed during a period of suspension.

The city clerk may suspend or revoke the license of any establishment which does not meet the licensing qualifications set forth in this chapter at any time such knowledge becomes known to such clerk.
(h)
An act or omission of a licensee, owner of more than five percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or of any provision of this chapter, will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of the license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter when the city clerk determines to such clerk's own satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues; provided, however, in the case of an employee, the city clerk must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or where the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring.

Any establishment allowing brown bagging on its premises shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and may be punished by a fine up to $100.00 per incident.

Each day's continuance of a violation shall be considered a separate offense.
(b)
Any untrue or misleading information contained in, or material omission left out of, an original, renewal, or transfer application for a license shall be cause for the denial thereof and, if any license has been granted under these circumstances, these shall be cause for revocation.
(c)
The city council may revoke or suspend a license or impose a fine against the licensee for any violation of this chapter. Such fine may be imposed by the city council in the maximum amount of $1,000.00 for the first violation, $1,000.00 for the second violation, and $1,000.00 for the third violation.
