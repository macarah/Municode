A subdivision eligible, and approved as provided herein, as a gated or limited access subdivision may make use of a gate or gates or other means to limit access over the public streets or roadways located wholly within said subdivision subject to the following conditions:
1.
Access must be provided over said streets at all times to all public safety vehicles including police, fire and ambulances, for the provision of public safety services; and
2.
Access must be provided over said streets during all normal working hours and during such additional times as required to provide the appropriate service for all other governmental and public service personnel such as building inspectors, utility service personnel, law enforcement and court personnel, and social service personnel for the provision of their normal services to the residents of said subdivision and/or facilities located within said subdivision or accessed by said subdivision streets; and
3.
Access must be provided over said streets during those periods from 8:00 a.m. local time to 5:00 p.m. local time Monday through Friday, not to include national holidays, for access by the general public for any and all legitimate purposes that the general public may make use of said roadway(s), subject to the additional restrictions herein. The subdivision, through its restrictive covenants, and with proper signage may further limit or deny access to any member of the general public, who is not an invitee of an owner of property within the subdivision, by:
i.
Denial of access onto any common area of the subdivision and/or any private property within the subdivision; and
ii.
Denial of access over said street(s) if said access is for the purpose of soliciting, advertising, campaigning or any other like purpose; and
iii.
Denial of access by pedestrian or other means other than by motor vehicles which are approved for transport on public roadways; and
iv.
Restricting the noise level from any vehicle upon its streets so long as those restrictions apply to all vehicles; and
v.
Deny any parking, stopping, or standing upon said roadways.
c.
Methods of limitations on access. Limitations on access must be provided by at least one of the following methods or a combination thereof, which must be approved by county prior to final approval of the subdivision plat and not less than 10 days prior to the activation of any limitation on access:
1.
A guard located at the entrance(s) that is available 24-hours per day;
2.
Providing an override code to the main gate for all emergency vehicles;
3.
Providing a system that allows access in response to a "yelp" signal from an emergency vehicle;
4.
Providing a system that allows access during normal workweek hours for non-emergency personnel; and/or
5.
Providing a system that allows access for the general public during the times set out above for such legitimate purposes, and subject to such additional limitations, as set out above.
6.
If a guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method shall be located not less than 60 feet from the edge of the pavement of the public roadway with which the subdivision entrance intersects, and not less than 50 feet from the right of way of said existing public roadway. Said entrance shall include a turn-around in the nature of a cul de sac that will allow traffic that is properly denied access, to be able to return to the existing public roadway without undue inconvenience and without undue disruption of traffic on the existing public roadway.
7.
If a gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said system shall automatically open and remain open during any time in which there is an interruption of power to, or other malfunction of, the device.
8.
If alterations are made to the gate or other method of limiting access without proper and prior notification that hinder the access of public safety vehicles and obstruct the provision of public safety services, or hinder or obstruct the access by other authorized personnel, then said public safety personnel and/or other authorized personnel may use such reasonable means as available to them to gain access and the developer and/or homeowners' association shall be responsible for damages incurred because of such hindrance or obstruction and/or the removal thereof. In the event a member of the general public is denied access in violation of the provisions for general public access provided above, then county shall be authorized through its designee to use such reasonable means as available to them to gain access as provided herein for said members of the general public and the developer and/or homeowners' association shall be responsible for damages incurred because of such hindrance or obstruction and/or the removal thereof. In the event that such denials of access or obstructions to access are without reasonable cause or the reason therefor is not remedied on a timely basis, then the county may withdraw the right of limiting access and said roadways shall become accessible to all in the same manner and to the same extent as all other county roadways on which there are no limitations on access.
d.
Conversion to a gated subdivision with private streets. In the event that a subdivision has been approved as a gated subdivision with limited access over its streets and desires to convert said subdivision to a gated subdivision with private streets, then the developer and/or homeowners'/property owners' association may apply for such approval and upon full compliance with all of the provisions provided in this code for such subdivisions, shall be granted that approval with county to deed to said homeowners' association any and all interest it has in said streets, subject to the retention by it of the access rights provided in this code and retention of such easements regarding utilities as provided in said code. The conveyance by a developer to county of roadways in a subdivision which has been approved for limited access shall be with the condition, whether specifically stated or not, that said streets are subject to being converted to private streets as provided herein. Such an application shall include an acknowledgement of responsibility in the same basic format as that provided for in the regulations regarding private streets designated therein as purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. This acknowledgement shall be signed by not less than 75% of the owners of property in the subdivision in addition to the property owned by the developer.
(2)
Gated subdivisionsâ€”private streets. Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the board of commissioners within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the board of commissioners at the time of preliminary plat approval or as a conversion from a gated subdivision with limited access as provided herein. Application for private streets in a major subdivision shall first be submitted to the administrator. If the administrator denies the request, the developer may appeal that decision in the same manner as other appeals. In the event that the planning commission approves the request or in the event the administrator initially approves the request, then the administrator's or planning commission's recommendation to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, shall be submitted to the board of commissioners and the board shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure various public purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section.
a.
Engineering plans required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of engineering and construction plans from the administrator, who shall consult with the county engineer and/or road superintendent in accordance with the requirements of this code.
b.
Standards. All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by Article V of this code, and applicable construction specifications of the administrator.
c.
Street names and signs. Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the administrator. The developer of land involving a private street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private," as approved by the administrator. The sign signifying the private street may be required by the administrator to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field.
d.
Easements. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general-purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private streets. Said easements shall at a minimum be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the major thoroughfare plan for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by local land use regulations. In the cases of private streets, the general-purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall either:
1.
Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street; or
2.
Shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot).
e.
Maintenance. The county shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets.
A private maintenance covenant recorded with the county clerk of the superior court shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general-purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for non-compliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms.
1.
The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners' or property owners' association in cases of a subdivision often or more lots fronting on a private street.
2.
The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule.
3.
The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street and shall also be enforceable by Baldwin County. Said covenant shall state that Baldwin County may enforce said covenant, but shall have no duty to do so and that primary enforcement shall be by the property owner(s).
4.
The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street.
5.
The covenant shall run with the land.
6.
The board of commissioners shall, at its discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the developer and held by a homeowners' or property owners' association, with said board as additional beneficiary of said bond(s), or require that the developer and/or property owners pay an amount of money as determined by the administrator into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners' or property owners' association as maintenance and repair needs may arise. The formula for establishing the costs of the repair and replacement of the roadways shall be based upon county's costs for such repairs on its roadways over the preceding two years; and
7.
The covenants may not provide for any payment directly or indirectly by said association to the developer for the costs of the initial construction of said roadways.
f.
Specifications for final plats involving private streets. The director shall not approve for recording any final plat involving a private street unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat:
1.
Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this section;
2.
"WARNING, Baldwin County has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, and other appurtenances contained within the general public purpose access and utility easement or easements for private streets shown on this plat.";
3.
"Grant of Easement. The general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) is hereby granted and said grant of rights shall be liberally construed to provide all necessary authority to the county and to public or private utility companies serving the subdivision, for the installation and maintenance of utilities, including, but not limited to, electric lines, gas lines, telephone lines, water lines, sewer lines, cable television lines, and fiber optic cables, together with the right to trim interfering trees and brush, together with a perpetual right of ingress and egress for installation, maintenance, and replacement of such lines.
___________________________________
Signature of Property Owner"; and
4.
(The following certificate of dedication shall be required, unless the Board of Commissioners waives the dedication requirement.)
"Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) are hereby dedicated to Baldwin County.
___________________________________
Signature of Property Owner."
g.
Requirement for purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. Prior to the sale or as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in the county, the developer or seller of said lot shall require the execution of a notarized purchaser's acknowledgement of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities. The document is with the code enforcement office. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgement shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot.
h.
Extent of limitations on access to private streets. A subdivision served by private streets may make use of a gate or gates or other means to limit access over its private streets, subject to the following conditions:
1.
Access must be provided over said private streets at all times to all public safety vehicles including police, fire and ambulances, for the provision of public safety services; and
2.
Access must be provided over said private streets during all normal working hours and during such additional times as required to provide the appropriate service for all other governmental and public service personnel such as building inspectors, utility service personnel, law enforcement and court personnel, and social service personnel for the provision of their normal services to the residents of said subdivision and/or facilities located within said subdivision or accessed by said private streets.
i.
Methods of limiting access to private streets. Access must be provided by at least one of the following methods or combination of methods, which must be approved by county prior to final approval of the subdivision plat and not less than 10 days prior to the activation of any limitation on access:
1.
A guard located at the entrance(s) that is available 24-hours per day;
2.
Providing an override code to the main gate for all emergency vehicles;
3.
Providing a system that allows access in response to a "yelp" signal from an emergency vehicle; and/or
4.
Providing a system that allows access during normal workweek hours for non-emergency personnel.
5.
If a guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method shall be located not less than 60 feet from the edge of the pavement of the public roadway with which the subdivision entrance intersects, and not less than 50 feet from the right of way of said existing public roadway. Said entrance shall include a turn-around in the nature of a cul-de-sac that will allow traffic that is properly denied access, to be able to return to the existing public roadway without undue inconvenience and without undue disruption of traffic on the existing public roadway.
6.
If a gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said system shall automatically open and remain open during any time in which there is an interruption of power to, or other malfunction of, the device.
7.
If alterations are made to the gate or other method of limiting access without proper and prior notification that hinder the access of public safety vehicles and obstruct the provision of public safety services, or hinder or obstruct the access by other authorized personnel, then said public safety personnel and/or other authorized personnel may use such reasonable means as available to them to gain access and the developer and/or homeowners' association shall be responsible for damages incurred because of such hindrance or obstruction and/or the removal thereof.
j.
Water/sewer provision. When any proposed development is within 2,500 feet of existing public water and/or sewer service, the developer shall provide a proposal for the extension of said service to said development and the availability of same to each development unit. The development may be denied approval if the county determines that such development without such services would necessitate excessive expenditure of public funds for the provision and maintenance of such services.

Sec. 16-50. - General requirements for street and other rights-of-way.
(a)
Paving, curbing and guttering requirements. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide for paving for all streets within the subdivision in compliance with this code, including Articles IV and V. In addition the developer shall stripe said roadways in accordance with DOT requirements for secondary roads; and shall provide all normal traffic, safety for secondary roads; and shall provide all normal traffic, safety and street signs for the subdivision, each intersection thereof, and all intersections with existing public roadways.
(b)
Street names. Street names shall require the approval of the administrator. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing streets. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets.
(c)
Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 115 feet shall not be permitted.
(d)
Cul-de-sacs. Except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length impractical, cul-de-sacs, or deadend streets, shall not be greater in length than 800 feet. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a property line radius of at least 50 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least 40 feet.
(e)
Development along existing roadways.
(1)
Entry to subdivisions. There shall be not less than one entry into the subdivision for each 100 lots or parts thereof. There shall be a buffer strip beginning at the intersection of each subdivision street right-of-way line and each public road right-of-way line. These buffer strips shall run not less than 100 feet along the subdivision right-of-way line and not less than 50 feet deep. No improvements shall be placed upon these strips except an entry-way sign for the subdivision. In the event that an additional entry or entries for subdivisions over 100 lots would not be feasible due to the limited road access, sight lines, other safety factors, or size and/or shape of the development, then the administrator may require acceleration and deceleration lanes, turning lanes, and increased road right-of-way along the entire frontage of the property as an alternate; and
(2)
Development along existing major street, limited access highway, or railroad right-of-way.
a.
Developments of more than ten lots Development shall be in accord with paragraph (d) below; and
b.
Developments of ten lots or less Development shall be in accord with paragraph (3) below; and
(3)
Development along existing county vehicular service roads. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing county vehicular service road, the administrator may require acceleration or deceleration lanes and/or a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way either as a marginal access street or, at a distance suitable for an appropriate use to the intervening land, with a nonaccess reservation. In addition, the administrator shall require that no more than one access for every 300 feet shall be allowed onto existing county vehicular services roads, by requiring use of common access areas or use of said marginal access streets; and
(4)
Developments of more than 20 lots. As to developments of more than 20 lots:
a.
No lot shall front upon or have direct access onto an existing county, state or federal roadway; and
b.
A buffer strip at least 20 feet wide shall be located adjacent to each exterior property line of the development including existing public roadways. This buffer may be included within any individual home lot if the lot size is increased by an additional ten feet of depth and the entire 20 feet is restricted as a buffer strip as required herein. This strip shall be planted with evergreen trees and hedge-type shrubs designed to provide full noise and sight screening and shall have no improvements located thereon; and
c.
In addition to the buffer required in paragraph b. there shall be set aside for the use and enjoyment of the owners of the subdivision a community park or parks, greenways, or recreational areas of the greater of two acres or one-tenth of an acre for the first 50 lots in the subdivision and one-twentieth of an acre per lot for all lots over 50 in the subdivision, with said area(s) accessible to all of the lots in the subdivision. This set-aside shall include not less than one composite area containing not less than 2 acres for each 50 lots in the subdivision. For example, a 100-lot subdivision would have one composite area of not less than four acres or two composite areas of not less than two acres each. The remaining greenway may be in the nature of buffer strips between adjacent lots and/or along the rear of the lots. Buffers, common areas, and greenways are intended to enhance the liveability of the subdivision and to benefit the owners thereof. The requirements cannot be met by the set-aside of irregular strips and gores or incidental open spaces which have no realistic use by the proposed residents on a day-to-day basis. The developer must justify the set-asides as consistent with the intent and purpose of these provisions; and
d.
The administrator may waive or modify these requirements as to lots which front upon a nonconnecting county roadway (cul-de-sac or dead end) or which front upon a county roadway originally developed as part of an existing subdivision if the developer can provide evidence that such waiver or modification will not have an undue adverse impact upon the safety and/or aesthetic goals and purposes of this regulation.
(f)
Alleys. Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multifamily, commercial, or industrial developments.
(g)
Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets, alleys, and public grounds shall not be permitted unless their control is placed in the hands of Baldwin County, under conditions approved by the administrator.
(h)
Easements. Easements having a minimum width of ten feet and located along the side or rear lot lines of a subdivision lot shall be provided as required for utility lines and underground mains and cables. These easements must be shown on the final plat. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage right-of-way of adequate width. Parallel streets may be required by the administrator in connection therewith.
( Ord. of 12-3-2019(2) )
Sec. 16-51. - Design standards for blocks and lots.
(a)
Block lengths and widths. Block lengths and widths shall be as follows:
(1)
Blocks shall not be greater than 1,200 feet in length nor less than 400 feet in length, except where approved by the administrator.
(2)
Block shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where abutting upon major streets, limited-access highways, or railroads or where other situations make this requirement impracticable.
(b)
Lot sizes. Residential lots shall meet or exceed the lot width and the lot area requirements as prescribed herein, unless greater requirements are imposed by other code provisions:
(1)
Residential lots shall have a depth of not less than 120 feet unless a home previously was built on the lot, or the lots adjacent to it were platted for less depth on or before July 1, 1991;
(2)
Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to use intended; and
(3)
Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to meet building setback requirements from both abutting streets.
(c)
Lot lines. All lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines, unless not practicable because of topographic or other features.
(d)
Building lines. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, there is hereby established a building setback line of 35 feet for the front yard setback; and 15 feet for each side and rear line.
(e)
Lots abutting public streets.
(1)
Each lot shall abut upon a dedicated public street for not less than 100 feet except cul-de-sac lots which may have a minimum street frontage of not less than 50 feet, or unless a home previously was built on the lot, or the adjacent homes' lots were platted for less depth on or before July 1, 1991; and
(2)
No lot shall be approved which constitutes a flag lot except:
a.
With special approval from the planning commission due to extreme topographic circumstances. If such approval is granted, no more than ten percent of the lots in the development may be flag lots and frontage may not be less than 50 feet for any lot; or
b.
For tracts larger than 50 acres which have more than 80 percent of their land area more than 500 feet from the public roadway.
c.
Flag lots are herein defined as a tract or lot of land of uneven dimensions in which the portion fronting on a street is less than the required minimum width required for construction of a building or structure on that lot.
(3)
Restricted exemption for tracts with limited road frontage: The requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are here modified so as to alleviate hardship as to tracts which had limited public road access on or before July 1, 1991, subject to compliance with all of the following conditions unless a home previously was built on the lot, or the adjacent homes' lots were platted for homes on or before July 1, 1991. Tracts may be divided pursuant to this section only once and the resulting tracts may not be divided without full compliance with all provisions of the Baldwin County Land Use Code. The phased development provisions of this code shall not apply to such subdivisions. In cases of such divisions, the developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of any easement, roadway or access to the lots which is over nonpublic roads.
This modification of the requirements of this section shall apply only to tracts which existed as separate tracts on July 1, 1991, and had public road access of less than 240 feet. As to such tracts, a division under this paragraph may be made if such division complies with all of the following requirements:
a.
A qualifying tract may be divided into no more than three lots;
b.
The resulting lots shall comply with all other regulations of the land use code, such as minimum widths at building line, setback lines, health department regulations, and other applicable regulations;
c.
The resulting lots shall each be at least one acre or the minimum size provided in subsection 16-72(a), whichever is larger;
d.
The public road access to the tract shall be equally divided between the resulting lots;
e.
If the lots front less than 20 each on public roads, then joint easements for access shall be provided to the owners of all lots over the entire access area; and
f.
The proposed division shall require the submission to the administrator of the proposed plat prepared in compliance with the requirements of this regulation and in addition to all other certifications, shall contain an affidavit of the owner that the tract to be subdivided:
1.
Was a separate and distinct tract on July 1, 1991, which had less than a total of 240 feet of public road frontage;
2.
That the proposed subdivision complies with all requirements of this section;
3.
That the access will be privately owned and maintained and shall not be eligible for acceptance as public roadways except upon compliance by the owners with county regulations regarding right-of-way widths, construction and paving;
4.
That the property may not be further divided without compliance with the minimum public road frontage requirements set forth in subsection 16-51(e)(1); and
5.
That certified copies of deeds or other documents establishing the status of the title on July 1, 1991, shall be supplied to the administrator.
g.
The final plat of the tract shall be recorded prior to the transfer of any property in the resulting subdivision and shall bear a conspicuous certificate of the administrator in substantially the following language:
"Notice:
1.
The Baldwin County Commission does not undertake to provide public road access to these lots nor is it obligated to pave or maintain roads providing access to these lots.
2.
It may not be possible to divide the lots shown on this plat The lots may not be divided into smaller tracts without complying with all provisions of the Baldwin County Land Use Code, particularly those relating to public road access."
(f)
Double and reverse frontage lots. Double frontage, and reverse frontage lots, should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
