Sec. 22-116. - Legislative findings.
In enacting this article, the mayor and city council of the City of Kennesaw make the following legislative findings:
(a)
The orderly flow of motorized traffic is a major concern in congested urban areas, particularly because an obstruction or delay in traffic at one point along a traffic artery results in delays and backups far down the roadway.
(b)
There exists a substantial disruption in crowd and traffic control caused by the solicitation of contributions.
(c)
Solicitation and selling requires "stopping [individuals] momentarily or for longer periods of time as money is given or exchanged for literature." Heffron v. International Society of Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 653 (1981).
(d)
Restrictions on the solicitation of contributions or sale of items on public streets and highways is necessary to assure the free movement of vehicle traffic on those streets and highways.
(e)
Unlike oral advocacy of ideas or the distribution of literature, successful solicitation of contributions or sales requires the individual to respond by searching for currency and passing it to the solicitor.
(f)
After the solicitor has departed, the driver must then secure any change returned, replace a wallet, or close a purse, and then return proper attention to his or her full responsibilities as motor vehicle driver.
(g)
The direct personal solicitation from drivers and occupants of motor vehicles distracts the driver from his or her primary duty to watch the traffic and potential hazards in the road, observe all traffic control signals or warnings, and prepare to move through the intersection.
(h)
The distraction of motorists occasioned by solicitation not only threatens to impede the orderly flow of traffic, but also raises concerns of traffic and public safety.
(i)
Evident dangers of physical injury and traffic disruption are present when individuals stand in the center of busy streets trying to engage drivers and solicit contributions from them. United States Labor Party v. Oremus, 619 F.2d 683, 688 (7th Cir. 1980).

ARTICLE VII. - FLEA MARKETS

Sec. 22-161. - Findings.
The mayor and council finds and determines as follows:
(1)
The city believes that flea markets are a special type of business which requires specific approval of operations from the mayor and council.
(2)
The general appearance of the city and specifically areas surrounding flea market locations is marred when operations are unsightly, inappropriate and poorly maintained, and when, in some instances, unsafe structures, sheds and sales areas exist and debris and refuse accumulate. Failure to properly construct and maintain improvements upon the premises further detracts from the general appearance of the area and presents safety hazards.
(3)
The aesthetic quality and economic value of both commercial and residential areas surrounding the flea markets as well as the economy of the city are adversely affected by the unregulated operation of flea markets.
(4)
Lives and property are endangered by traffic created by the flea markets which have been unregulated and uncontrolled and by vehicles for which no provisions for parking and safe ingress and egress have been made by flea market operators.
(5)
Flea markets create difficulty in police supervision because of lack of any controls over the number, identification and types of vendors and merchandise sold, and may become targets for sale or dealing in stolen merchandise.
(6)
Most flea markets fail to provide even minimum facilities for the protection of the health or comfort of persons on the premises in the nature of plumbing, electrical and bathroom facilities.
(7)
The public health, safety and welfare of the city can be detrimentally and adversely affected by the unregulated operation of flea markets.

Hillsborough County, Florida, 2007 WL 2936211 (M.D. Fla.), the mayor and city council find:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
(2)
Based upon the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences the mayor and city council finds are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within this country, the mayor and city council finds that public nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult cabarets begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. The mayor and city council find that nudity and the depiction thereof, coupled with alcohol in public places, encourages undesirable behavior and is not in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. The mayor and city council have chosen to avoid the disturbances associated with mixing alcohol and nude dancing by means of a reasonable restriction upon sexually oriented businesses in relation to the consumption of alcohol on premise.
(3)
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
(4)
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

ARTICLE XVI. - REGULATION OF PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINICS

Sec. 22-446. - Legislative findings of the city council and mayor.
The mayor and city council of the City of Kennesaw find as follows:
(a)
Information received from law enforcement officials in several states indicate that criminal activity increases in areas where pain management clinics operating as no more than "pill mills" are located.
(b)
The Grand Jury in Broward County, Florida, heard testimony and considered evidence concerning the proliferation of such pain clinics in Broward County and South Florida.
(c)
The Broward County, Florida, Grand Jury issued its Interim Report on November 19, 2009, concerning The Proliferation of Pain Clinics in South Florida ("Broward County Grand Jury Report").
(d)
The Broward County Grand Jury Report found that, "In 2007 there were 4 pain clinics operating in Broward County. From those 4 pain clinics in Broward County the number swelled to 66 pain clinics operating in South Florida in 2008. From August 2008 to November 2009 the number of pain clinics opening and operating in South Florida exploded in number from 66 to 176, and the number of pain clinics opening and operating in Broward County increased from 47 to 115. Pain clinics, which dispense prescription drugs on site, dispensed almost 9 million doses units of Oxycodone in South Florida during the last months of 2008. 6.5 million dose units of the 9 million dose units were dispensed in Broward County alone." Broward County Grand Jury Report at page 6.
(e)
The Broward County Grand Jury Report reported that the Florida Medical Examiners Commission reported as follows:
EXPAND
Calendar Year Number of Deaths Detected that were Caused by Lethal Doses of Prescription Drugs Average Number of Deaths Detected that were Caused by Lethal Doses of Prescription Drugs
2006 2,780 7 deaths/day
2007 3,317 9 deaths/day
2008 3,750 10 deaths/day
  Broward County Grand Jury Report at pages 9-10.
(f)
The Broward County Grand Jury Report reported as follows: "The National Survey on Drug Use and Health conducted annually by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration estimates that in the last 30 days over 5 million Americans used non-medical prescription opoids or narcotic analgesics or pain relievers. In 2005, 11,300,000 Americans age 12 and above had used prescription pain medication in a non-medical use. In 2007, the number increased almost 50% to 16,280,000 Americans. One of the age groups that have shown the highest levels of prescription non-medical use has been young adults age 18 to 25. In 2007, 2,147,000 Americans were first time non-medical users of prescription pain medication." Broward County Grand Jury Report, at pages 11-12.
(g)
The City of Kennesaw has great respect for reputable medical practitioners who are attempting to diagnose and treat pain being experienced by their patients.
(h)
The typical pain clinic which is operating as no more than a "pill mill" has little or no interest in treating pain or the symptom of the pain but is interested in only dispensing prescription pain medication with little or no diagnosis of the "patient". See Broward County Grand Jury Report at pages 19-20.
(i)
The Broward County Grand Jury Report found that "[a] couple of cities in Broward County have attempted to restrict the growing number of clinics in their cities by enacting ordinances to prohibit the location of pain management clinics that dispense narcotic drugs on site." Broward County Grand Jury Report at page 33.
(j)
The typical "pill mill" prescribes and dispenses the pain medications on-site.
(k)
The City of Kennesaw has been made aware of numerous news reports describing a "pipeline" of trafficking drugs from pain management clinics in South Florida to users in states such as Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio.
(l)
Prescription drug abuse is becoming a major problem in Georgia and according to the Georgia Drug and Narcotics Agency deaths due to prescription drug overdoses have surpassed those of all other illicit drugs.
(m)
Some pain clinics have no interest in the diagnosis and treatment of medical issues or problems that are resulting in pain being experienced by the patients, but are operated solely to write prescriptions for highly addictive pain medications which are then sold by the clinic to the "patient" making such a clinic as no more than a "pill mill".

Sec. 22-481. - Purpose.
This chapter shall apply to the establishment, operation and maintenance of all eating and drinking establishments within the downtown development authority metes and bounds area.

The city manager, finance director and his or her designee shall have broad discretion to grant, modify, or revoke permits pursuant to this chapter in the interests of improving the public health, safety, and welfare.
