Sec. 18-49. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all land development and land disturbance activity on any parcel containing a stream protection area. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
(1)
Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities:
a.
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives.
b.
Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, and other land disturbance activities not requiring permits under this article or any other provision of the Code; provided, however, any new land development or land disturbance activities on such properties shall be subject to this article.
c.
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of this article.
d.
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives.
(2)
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
a.
Activities for the purpose of building one of the following:
1.
A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line;
2.
Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;
3.

After the effective date of this article, the buffer requirements and the setback requirements stipulated herein shall apply to new subdivisions and site plans or any other construction, land development or land disturbances in the proximity of a stream, whether or not the stream is located within the parcel where the activity is proposed.
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to subsection 18-50(b) below.
(Ord. No. 2017-04-89, § 3, 5-16-2017)
Sec. 18-50. - Land development requirements.
(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development and land disturbance activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall also be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, around lakes and ponds as measured from the normal pool elevation.
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the Peachtree Corners Community Development Department finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Peachtree Corners may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided above, the Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Peachtree Corners shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the zoning board of appeals. The City of Peachtree Corners shall give public notice of each such public hearing in the city's legal organ. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and,
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

Sec. 18-51. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements.
This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other article, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence, which includes but is not limited to the following:
Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan
Requires a 50-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer and 150-foot impervious surface setback on the Chattahoochee River and its impoundments and a 35-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer (all measured from the edge of the water) on perennial tributary streams in a corridor extending 2,000 feet from either bank of the river and its impoundments. The corridor extends from Buford Dam to the downstream limits of the Atlanta region (Douglas and Fulton Counties).
DNR Part 5 Criteria for Small (under 100 square miles) Water Supply Watersheds
Authorized under Part V of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, these criteria require 100-foot undisturbed buffers and 150-foot setbacks on all perennial streams within seven miles upstream of a public water supply reservoir or public water supply intake. Beyond seven miles, the required buffer is 50 feet and the required setback is 75 feet.
DNR Part 5 Criteria for River Protection
Authorized under the 1991 Mountains and River Corridors Protection Act of 1991, these criteria require a 100-foot buffer along rivers with average annual flows of greater than 400 cfs (excepting the portion of the Chattahoochee referenced above). The buffer is measured from the top of the stream bank.
