ARTICLE V. - DISTRICT STANDARDS AND PERMITTED USES

Sec. 86-91. - Conditions of previous zoning approvals retained.
All conditions imposed as conditions of rezoning of property prior to adoption of the official zoning map are hereby retained and reaffirmed, and shall continue in full force and effect until such time as the property is rezoned or the prior zoning action of the mayor and city council is amended through the rezoning process established by article XII of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.01), 8-15-05)
Sec. 86-92. - District standards.
Each zoning district contains uses that are permitted "by right," without the need for further zoning approval. Site plan approval or building permit issuance may be required prior to establishment of a use on the property. Accessory uses, that is, uses customarily incidental to the principal use may also be permitted, usually subject to certain restrictions. Conditional uses may be approved in particular zoning districts, subject to certain conditions enforced through the rezoning process. Finally, specific uses are prohibited in all zoning districts.
(Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.02), 8-15-05)
Sec. 86-93. - Permitted uses and accessory uses.
Principal uses that are permitted by right in each zoning district are indicated in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. Accessory uses customarily incidental to principal uses are permitted.
(Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.03), 8-15-05)
Sec. 86-94. - Conditional uses.
Conditional uses that may be permitted in each zoning district are also indicated in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. Conditions automatically assigned to certain uses are found in article VI, Conditional uses.
(Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.04), 8-15-05)
Sec. 86-95. - Prohibited uses.
Certain uses are specifically prohibited in all zoning districts. These are indicated in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district.
(Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.05), 8-15-05)
Sec. 86-96. - Identification of uses.
Uses regulated under this chapter are primarily identified in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), United States, 2002, published by the Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget. Uses not listed in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district, may be approved following an interpretation by the city manager as provided in article II. The NAICS establishes a numbering system for a diverse range of activities. These numbers and the activities referenced are indicated in the tables for each zoning district. The NAICS numbering system is used for reference and interpretation, only; the NAICS is not adopted as part of this chapter.

(f)
Certain changes not prohibited. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of a structure in the historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Such a determination by the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall be made and documented after an examination of all alternative actions intended to result in the preservation of any feature are exhausted.
(g)
Delay in demolition of historic buildings. Following designation of an historic district, no building or structure therein shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner thereof shall have given the historic preservation commission via the director of downtown development's office 120 days' written notice of his proposed action. Upon receiving written notice, the city shall erect a sign on the property to indicate that the building or structure is proposed for demolition. During such 120-day period the historic preservation commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. Should the historic preservation commission find that the building involved has no particular historic significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it may waive all or part of such 120-day period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In making a determination of a building's particular historic significance, the historic preservation commission shall refer to the most recent inventory of historic buildings kept on file at the office of downtown development.

In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior architectural features shall be construed to mean the style, material, and location of all such signs. The commission shall not consider interior arrangement and shall take no action under this section except for the purpose of preventing the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving of buildings, structures, appurtenant features, or outdoor advertising signs in the historic district that would be incongruous with the historic aspects of the district.
(f)
Certain changes not prohibited. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of a structure in the historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Such a determination by the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall be made and documented after an examination of all alternative actions intended to result in the preservation of any feature are exhausted.
(g)
Delay in demolition of historic buildings. From and after the designation of a historic district, no building or structure therein shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner thereof shall have given the historic preservation commission via the director of downtown development's office 120 days' written notice of his proposed action. Upon receiving written notice, the city shall erect a sign on the property to indicate that the building or structure is proposed for demolition. During such 120-day period the historic preservation commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. Should the historic preservation commission find that the building involved has no particular historic significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it may waive all or part of such 90-day period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In making a determination of a building's particular historic significance, the historic preservation commission shall refer to the most recent inventory of historic buildings kept on file at the office of downtown development.

Sec. 86-104. - MX mixed use district.
(a)
Purpose. MX districts may hereafter be established in accordance with the general procedures and requirements set forth in article XII, Amendments. Such areas are defined as mixed use districts for establishment of complementary groupings of residential, commercial and/or office uses. Such developments as may exist, or may have been previously approved and substantially comply with the intent of these regulations, may be rezoned to MX status and shall thereafter be subject to the regulations of the MX district.
The intent of the MX district is to provide for establishment of such districts at appropriate locations as may be identified on the Future Land Use Map of the City of Jonesboro Comprehensive Plan and are adequately served by the transportation network, including the C-Tran Bus System, and in accordance with standards set forth herein. Uses within mixed use developments shall be integrated to create walkable settings rather than isolated on individual parcels characterizing such development as could occur by traditional zoning. The MX district affords densities that would not other wise be permitted, and in exchange for such density bonuses, architectural style and site design must yield superior public venues. Accordingly, the district mandates appropriately scaled and balanced residential, commercial and office uses located in a manner that minimizes vehicular traffic congestion by providing housing proximate to principal destinations. Convenient pedestrian networks, supported by such amenities as greenspace, trails and paths, furnishings, pedestrian scale lighting and water features are hallmarks of such developments. Site design shall also serve to minimize the role of automobiles by creating deck parking that features streetfront retail or service uses, courtyard parking located in the interior of parcels and other appropriate site designs.
(b)
Development standards. Mixed use districts shall be controlled by the following development standards:
(1)
Site designs and structures shall achieve horizontal and vertical mix of uses.
(2)
Residential uses shall comprise a minimum of 25 percent of the total floor area of an MX district; similarly commercial uses shall also comprise a minimum of 25 percent of the total floor area of an MX district.
(3)
Dwelling units shall not be located on "storefront," that is, the ground floor of any fronting a street.
(4)
Ninety percent of all residential units within a MX district shall be owner-occupied units and such language shall be recorded with the declarations and covenants controlling the development.
(5)
Minimum floor area for attached dwelling units shall be as follows:
a.
One-bedroom units: 900 square feet
b.
Two-bedroom units: 1,200 square feet
c.
Three-bedroom units: 1,400 square feet
(6)
Residential uses shall be located away from major streets and other noise generators such as waste disposal facilities and loading areas to preserve privacy and tranquility.
(7)
Commercial and service uses shall be concentrated for maximum pedestrian convenience and easily accessible to residents of the development as well as employees and visitors.
(8)
Minimum tract size shall be two acres.
(9)
Building setbacks and separation and minimum lot area shall be as proposed and approved on the preliminary site plan.
(10)
A transition from more intense uses as may be located in an MX district to surrounding districts shall be achieved through designs that avoid siting mid and high rise structures or surface parking at the periphery of such developments. Greenspace and low or medium density residential uses shall be situated along common boundaries with any adjacent low density residential uses.
(11)
Landscape buffering may be used when non-residential uses abut residential uses at a common boundary in lieu of siting residential uses at the periphery of the development. Such buffer shall conform to planting standards of article XV and be a minimum of 15 feet in horizontal width; however, shall be increased in width a dimension of ten feet for each story proposed that is greater than the height of residential structures bordering the MX district.
(12)
All outside storage areas shall be located in the rear yard and shall be screened by a solid fence, wall or evergreen landscaping each having a minimum height of eight feet.
(13)
A maximum of 25 percent of the required parking area may front on a public right-of-ways. Site design shall serve to reduce the visibility of these areas and apparent size from public right-of-ways.
(14)
Signs shall be located a minimum of 100 feet from any adjacent residential district and oriented away from such districts.
(c)
Permitted principal uses and structures. Uses permitted in the MX district are presented in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district.
(d)
Permitted accessory uses. Uses customarily accessory and clearly incidental to permitted principal uses and structures shall be permitted in this district and are presented in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. Devices used for electrical power generation, such as solar panels, wind generators and similar devices, are also allowed.
(e)
Prohibited uses. Uses prohibited in the MX District are presented in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. No building or structure height or mass greater than that of the Clayton County Courthouse shall be permitted.
(f)
Residential density permitted. Residential density in mixed use structures shall not exceed 24 dwelling units per acre. Density for single family attached structures shall not exceed 12 dwelling units per acre and density for single family detached structures shall not exceed six dwelling units per acre.
(g)
Off-street parking and loading requirements. Off-street parking shall be provided as specified in Article XIII of this chapter. Off-street parking shall be provided as follows:
(1)
Residential uses: Two spaces per dwelling unit for single family detached and single family attached structures; 1½ spaces per dwelling unit for dwellings in mixed use structures.
(2)
Recreational establishments: One per 400 square feet of floor area.
(3)
Restaurants: One per 100 square feet of floor area available to the public.
(4)
Retail uses: One per 300 square feet of floor area available to the public.
(5)
Office uses: One per 250 square feet of floor area.
(6)
Accessory outdoor dining: One per 200 square feet of dining area.
(h)
Site planning. In addition to the standards of review of the ordinance contained in article XII, the following criteria shall be used to evaluate the merits of proposals for MX district zoning.
(1)
Compatibility of the MX district with surrounding context. MX districts may be appropriate at the margin of single family detached neighborhoods; however, the district is not contemplated for locations within such neighborhoods. Development standards in rendering the proposed development compatible with the context.
(2)
Consistency with the comprehensive plan. The future land use map identifies appropriate locations for mixed use development. This document will guide the approval of any MX district application.
(3)
Architectural style and quality. The MX district conveys site design and development intensity not available in traditional zoning districts. Architectural style and the quality of building materials are expected to be superior to projects that may not enjoy such development rights. Construction consistent with high-quality environments seen in the region's premier mixed use locales will be sought in the MX district.
(4)
Integration of uses. Atlanta Regional Commission has defined mixed use as "a mix of uses is the practice of providing a number of uses in proximity to create lifestyle or transportation benefits through increasing the opportunities for walking, biking or using transit." The MX district is established to promote walkable developments where residential uses are incorporated with commercial uses in a manner that invites use of nearby and facilities and services. Designs and development scale that reinforce such integration are preferable to those that isolate residential uses from convenience services and employment opportunities. At the same time, retail and service establishments should be grouped for maximum pedestrian convenience in locations uninterrupted by residential or office occupancies. Such objectives may also be achieved by vertical separation of residential and office uses from retail and service areas to preserve the street level tradition of the latter uses.
(5)
Appropriate relationships of uses. MX site plans shall provide for the safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious grouping of structures, uses, facilities and greenspace. Such provisions shall facilitate pedestrian travel among major destinations within and adjacent to the district with a minimum of conflicts with vehicles.
(6)
Pedestrian and greenspace network. Pedestrian ways through buildings shall relate to a network of greenspaces reserved for pedestrian use. Interior and exterior pedestrian ways shall be scaled appropriately to the anticipated foot traffic volumes and form a convenient network linking major concentrations of uses within the district, and shall connect to C-Tran transit stops, both within and at the edge of the district.
(7)
Streets, parking facilities and service areas. Streets, parking facilities and service areas shall be located and designed to segregate vehicles from pedestrian focal points and gathering areas. Such segregation may be horizontal, with vehicular areas grouped in logical locations or locations at edge of the MX district and adjacent to major streets, or achieved vertically in decks above the street level.
(i)
Procedure for establishment of an MX district. Preliminary site plan, architecturals and project description. The owner or owners of the entire tract of land proposed to be included in the MX district shall file an application for rezoning.

Sec. 86-106. - C-1 neighborhood commercial district.
(a)
Purpose. The C-1 neighborhood commercial district is established to promote development of limited commercial and service establishments in close proximity to the neighborhoods they are intended to serve. Beyond limiting the range of permitted uses and the scale of individual buildings, the extent of the neighborhood commercial district itself is to be limited to ensure that consumer demand is not generated from outside the immediate neighborhood and that commercial encroachment into the neighborhood does not occur. Parking standards are relaxed to encourage walking, and pedestrian amenities are required to create and enhance a neighborhood atmosphere. The C-1 district is envisioned as a destination environment in which shoppers may access a variety of goods and services, particularly entertainment services such as restaurants. Uses that foster "one-stop" shopping such as auto parts stores are prohibited as are site plans that feature extensive parking along the right-of-way.

Sec. 86-110. - Assembly overlay.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the assembly overlay is to accommodate the beneficial development of "places of assembly" as defined in section 86-62, Definitions, and appropriately regulate such uses in a non-discriminatory manner. The express intention of mayor and council in the event of any ambiguity in the language of this section mandates that the administration and city staff interpret this section in a manner that best complies with all applicable federal laws, including, but not limited to, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000cc et seq.
(b)
Applicability. The assembly overlay establishes the parameters within which places of assembly may be established and operated. The assembly overlay supplements zoning regulations set forth by the underlying or base zoning assigned to properties on the official zoning map that control the use and development of those properties. Unless otherwise provided, the legal use of property as defined by the underlying zoning district may continue. Standards set forth in this section shall control over any underlying district regulations. Development regulations not addressed in this section as provided by the underlying zoning classification shall control unless modified by mayor and council as a condition of assignment of the assembly overlay to a particular property.
(c)
Geography. Assignment of the assembly overlay is as depicted graphically on the official zoning map. Properties included in the assembly overlay shall be shown on this map and shall include any property subsequently so designated by mayor and council.
(d)
Administrative approval of compliant places of assembly. Applications for establishment of places of assembly that comply with the regulations set forth in this section may be approved administratively by the code enforcement officer. In considering the appropriateness of an approval of a place of assembly, the code enforcement officer shall apply the standards contained in article XII, section 86-374. Standards of review for map amendments of the Jonesboro Zoning Ordinance and the potential impacts on surrounding development, operating schedule, parking demand relative to supply and peak traffic impacts. Applications that do not comply with these regulations may be approved by mayor and council as a conditional use.
(e)
Mayor and council approval of non-compliant places of assembly. Places of assembly can exert extraordinary demands upon public services and facilities, particularly when established within certain timeframes or in certain locations. Accordingly, applications for places of assembly that do not comply with the assembly overlay regulations may only be established upon approval of a conditional use by mayor and council. The approval process pertaining to places of assembly shall be that assigned conditional uses as described in article VI, Conditional uses. In determining whether an application for such conditional use shall be approved at a particular location, mayor and council shall apply the standards contained in article XII, section 86-374 of the Jonesboro Zoning Ordinance. Mayor and council shall also consider the potential impacts on surrounding development, noise impacts, peak traffic impacts and demand on public services and facilities. Upon a finding that a particular assembly use would conform to the intent and requirements of this section, the application may be approved by mayor and council as a conditional use. Based upon particular circumstances associated with a proposed assembly use at a specific location, mayor and council may attach conditions to the approval that are designed to minimize potential negative impacts and burdens on public facilities and services as well as surrounding properties and travelers on public streets and sidewalks.
(f)
Characterization of places of assembly as concerns scale. Places of assembly are hereby characterized as either "large places of assembly" or "small places of assembly." This characterization is designed to ensure that proposals for establishment of places of assembly are compatible with the scale, use and intensity of surrounding development and may be accommodated by available public infrastructure and services. For purposes of this section "large places of assembly" are defined as those premises or facilities designed to accommodate 50 or more persons at any given time; "small places of assembly" are defined as those premises or facilities designed to accommodate fewer than 50 at any given time. Capacity shall be as measured by the premises or facility occupancy, including indoor and outdoor spaces available to participants, as determined by the fire marshall.
(g)
Standards for establishment of all places of assembly. The following development standards shall apply to any place of assembly.
(1)
Parking and loading regulations. Parking and loading shall be as specified in article XIII, Parking, loading and interior circulation. No parking shall be established within 25 feet of a lot that is zoned residential or containing a residential use.
(2)
Fire and life safety compliance. No permit for establishment of a place of assembly shall be granted prior to an inspection and approval for compliance with all fire and life safety codes by the fire marshall.
(3)
Places of assembly may not be established on lots with zero lot line development or parking in common. Because of the potential noise impacts and peak parking demand, places of assembly shall not be established on properties that share a common wall with adjoining tenant spaces or properties. Similarly, because of the peak parking demand associated with such uses, places of assembly shall not be established on properties that share a common parking area.
(4)
Street network. The potential for creating traffic congestion during peak periods and for excessive on-street parking during peak periods is substantial. Therefore, no assembly use shall be permitted on a lot accessed by a local street as defined by the City of Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan. Assembly uses shall only be permitted on roadways classified as "major collector street" or roadways having greater capacity as defined by the City of Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan.
(5)
Buffers. The potential for adverse visual impacts such as glare and noise impacts on adjoining and nearby residential uses by assembly uses is substantial. Therefore, buffers are required for the protection of adjoining residential properties. A natural or manmade, landscaped buffer in compliance with section 86-457. Landscape strip planting requirements of this chapter and the following schedule shall be maintained along the boundary of any property designated as an assembly overlay that abuts property on which a residential use is established or property zoned for residential use:
a.
Residential uses or districts. A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of 30 feet shall be established, provided such buffer may be reduced to 25 feet where a berm having a minimum height of three feet is created.
b.
Buffers shall be permanently maintained as indicated on the approved site plan, subject to inspection by the code enforcement officer, and consistent with any other property improvement. The dimension of the buffer shall not be in addition to any other landscaping requirements of this chapter. As the purpose of the buffer is to visually screen and distance uses of the assembly overlay from adjoining uses, one-half of all plant materials shall consist of one or more species that retain foliage throughout the year. Provision of opaque fencing, though desirable, shall not decrease the horizontal dimension of the required buffer.
(h)

e.
Minimum side yard on street side of a corner lot. None.
f.
Minimum side yard. Five feet; 30 feet when abutting a residential district or use.
g.
Maximum ground coverage by buildings and impervious surfaces. Seventy percent.
(2)
Height regulations. The maximum height for buildings abutting a residential district or use shall be three stories or 35 feet as measured at any point 30 feet from any common property line. Building height may be increased one foot for every additional foot beyond a distance of 30 feet from any common property line. No building shall exceed a height of 45 feet.
(j)
Existing place of assembly uses. No assembly use existing as of the date of adoption of this chapter and designated on the official zoning map shall become a nonconforming use as a result of adoption of this article.

Sec. 86-111. - Historic residential overlay.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the historic residential overlay is to protect and enhance the character of the city's historic neighborhoods by establishing architectural standards for regulation of exterior rehabilitation and new construction. The City of Jonesboro is committed to preserving its historic structures and the special character of the historic neighborhoods. These neighborhoods reflect a variety of architectural styles that have contributed to the city's historic built environment.
(b)
Applicability. The City of Jonesboro has been organized into several historic property groups, (1) the National Register District shall be subject to the provisions of the H-1 or H-2 zoning districts, as appropriate; (2) historic residential properties located within the historic residential overlay shall be subject to the provisions of the historic residential overlay and the provisions of article VII (3) historic commercial properties located within the historic residential overlay shall be subject to the architectural standards of the H-2 district found in subsection 86-103(l), Design standards; and (4) residential properties found outside the National Register District and the historic residential overlay shall be subject to the provisions of article VII.
The historic residential overlay supplements zoning regulations that control the use and development of properties in the overlay. These supplemental regulations focus on architectural standards designed to protect and enhance the historic residential structures and character of properties encompassed in the overlay. Land and buildings within the overlay shall continue to be used in accordance with standards of the underlying zoning district. Where any part of this article conflicts with other standards of this zoning ordinance, the more restrictive standard shall control.

(Ord. No. 2006-08, § 1, 9-19-2006)
Sec. 86-113. - Reserved.
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2019-011 , § 1, adopted June 3, 2019, repealed § 86-113, which pertained to the C-I civic-institutional district, and derived from (Ord. No. 2014-003, § 1, adopted June 9, 2014.
Sec. 86-114. - A-E arts and entertainment district overlay.
(a)
Factual. In adopting the city arts and entertainment district overlay zone (the "arts and entertainment district overlay"), the city seeks to reinvent itself as a cultural destination, particularly its walkable downtown. The downtown has declined over the past 40 or more years. This effectively eliminated Jonesboro as a recipient of a very significant consumer market generated by east coast travelers and local commuters. Jonesboro has also suffered from the general lack of investment characterizing Atlanta's south side, reinforced by a failure of south side incomes and housing values to keep pace with Atlanta's north side.
As the regional and national economy rebounds, the city seeks to create an in-town, arts identity that will attract air travelers, local visitors and as importantly, bolster consumer offerings for Jonesboro residents. The arts and entertainment district overlay will become a significant element of an economic development strategy that will capitalize on Jonesboro's location, sense of place, walkability and small-town charm.
An important aspect of that development strategy is the assignment of property rights not available to owners outside the arts and entertainment district overlay. This reflects an emphasis on compact development supported by such public investment as streetscapes, public parking, public art, wayfinding signs, kiosks, film festivals and community events. The flexibility of building and site design and planned public investment are intended to foster an arts and entertainment district that will establish downtown Jonesboro as a regional destination for the arts and for community celebrations, dining and shopping.
(b)
Definitions.
Arts means the interpretation of imagination and creativity in a physical form or performance.
Art center means a facility whose mission is to promote the arts and make them available to the public. An arts center may host art exhibits and shows, provide studio space for the use of artists and engage in public education and exposure to the arts.
Art gallery means an establishment that engages in the sale, loan or display of paintings, sculptures, photographs, video art or other works of art. "Art gallery" does not include a cultural facility such as a library, museum or non-commercial gallery that may also display works of art or an arts studio.
Art use means creation or assembly of visual art, including two- and three-dimensional works of fine art or craft, or other fine art objects created or assembled for purposes of sale, display, commission, or trade by artists or artisans. Art use may also include classes held for art instruction.
Artist means a person who practices one of the fine arts, design, graphic, musical, literary, computer, or performing arts; or a person whose profession relies on application of these skills to produce a creative product. The term includes, but is not limited to, individuals who practice visual arts, such as painters, print makers, illustrators, sculptors, potters, jewelry makers, glass makers, craft artists and photographers; performing arts, such as musicians, composers, playwrights, choreographers and dancers; literary arts, such as creative writers and literary translators; architecture and design, such as architects, landscape architects, engineers, urban designers and planners, interior designers and decorators, industrial designers, graphic designers and fashion designers; and media arts, such as filmmakers, video and audio artists and web-based designers.

Thereafter, each new member shall be appointed for a term of two years.
Makerspace means an indoor or outdoor facility or both intended to be used by artists as studio and retail space. Makerspaces often combine production, equipment, community, and education for the purposes of enabling participating individuals to design, prototype, and create works that said individuals would have difficulty producing if working alone due to a lack of resources, tools, artistic input, and/or space. Such space may be in a residential, commercial, mixed use or a live/work building and often provides tools for community use. Makerspaces are characterized by consistent design elements, such as high ceilings, large windows, durable surfaces and wide entrances. These spaces are designed to accommodate and foster a variety of creative activities. Makerspaces may also include common space such as galleries, meeting rooms and open space that encourages resident engagement and community involvement.

Thrift stores do not include those selling vehicles, auto parts, scrap, or waste.
(c)
Purpose. The purpose of the arts and entertainment district overlay is to facilitate creation of an arts destination, sustain established arts and cultural uses and promote new arts and cultural uses. The arts and entertainment district overlay seeks integration of the arts into the fabric of the community and is conceived as the location of art galleries and art studios forming the core of an arts district. A complementary mix of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues will support these uses. These elements are expected to generate interest in downtown Jonesboro and attract arts and cultural events.
The arts and entertainment district overlay features an expanded range of permitted uses focused on the arts while retaining all property rights established by the underlying zoning. The arts and entertainment district overlay encourages adaptive reuse of historic buildings and new construction technologies, affording owners expanded development options. These measures will enhance the market attractiveness of the arts district.
Arts venues, community festivals, expanded arts uses and pedestrian character are expected to promote an arts district. Planned investment in public art, lighting, sidewalks and off-street parking will leverage private investment and enhance public safety. This combination of public and private investment is expected to advance Jonesboro's position in regional leadership in the arts and stimulate broad economic revitalization. Importantly, the arts district overlay features walkable distances from nearby neighborhoods to small-scale establishments and live entertainment venues accommodated by the arts district overlay and compatible with the neighborhood character.
(d)
Applicability. Unless expressly modified by regulations in this article establishing the arts and entertainment district overlay, the regulations governing the use of land and structures shall be as set forth in the underlying zoning districts and as regulated by other provisions of this Code. The architectural design standards shall control development in the arts and entertainment district overlay, unless an alternate provision is adopted in the arts and entertainment district overlay. Where a conflict with other city Code and ordinance provisions exists, the more permissive standard shall apply.
(e)
Geography. Generally, the arts and entertainment district overlay radiates from downtown Jonesboro running along Main Street (i.e. from Spring Street south to Church Street), South McDonough Street (from King Street south to Key Street) and Broad Street (to include the Firehouse Museum and adjoining property) and west of Main Street and north of West Mill Street to include Lee Street Park. The district is more specifically identified in the following figure entitled "Exhibit A: Jonesboro Arts and Entertainment District Overlay."
(f)
Scale. Downtown Jonesboro is the focus of the arts and entertainment district overlay. Jonesboro was established at a time when walking was the primary means of travel, and the downtown is characterized by a pedestrian scale. This scale is preserved by height limits inherent in the development intensity assigned to the downtown on Jonesboro's future development map and development standards of the arts and entertainment district overlay. A sense of place will be maintained by adherence to these height limits. Preservation of pedestrian scale is important as arts districts are typically designed to encourage walking to a variety of venues.
(g)

Secs. 86-115, 86-116. - Reserved.
new
Sec. 86-117. - Active senior district overlay.
new
(a)
Factual. In adopting the city's active senior district overlay zone (the "active senior district overlay"), the city seeks to establish vibrant hubs in and around its downtown core, which strive to improve both livability and walkability in this vital area. Because Jonesboro has suffered from the general lack of investment characterizing Atlanta's south side, reinforced by a failure of south side incomes and housing values to keep pace with Atlanta's north side, establishment of these hubs serves as an impetus to further reinvigorating development in the downtown area and as a source of a more diverse range of quality housing to supplement the city's aging housing stock.
(b)
Definitions. For definitions of specific terms, refer to Code section 86-62.
(c)
Purpose. The purpose of the active senior district overlay is to facilitate creation of a residential zone, or hub, which allows a mix of housing styles and types on the same property, which are intended to meet the needs of the 55-year-old plus, active-living demographic. The zone will also provide a range of recreational amenities for its residents. A complementary mix of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues nearby will support this use. Through quality development, these zones, or hubs, will serve as vibrant "junctions" within the interconnected downtown area. They are also expected to generate more interest in downtown Jonesboro through the "live here, work here, play here" philosophy, featuring walkable distances to all aspects of downtown life, from arts and entertainment to restaurants and other businesses and offices. The active senior district overlay features an expanded range of permitted uses focused on the residential needs of the 55-year-old plus, active-living demographic, while retaining all property rights established by the underlying zoning(s).
(d)
Applicability. Unless expressly modified by regulations in this article establishing the active senior district overlay, the regulations governing the use of land and structures shall be as set forth in the underlying zoning districts and as regulated by other provisions of this Code. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the current architectural design standards shall control development in the active senior district overlay, unless alternate provisions are adopted in the active senior district overlay. Exterior architectural design features shall be subject to review and approval by the design review commission. Where a conflict with other city code and ordinance provisions exists, the more permissive standard shall apply. The active senior district overlay shall supersede the requirements of the historic residential overlay and the assembly overlay, wherever they may overlap with its geographical boundaries.
(e)
Geography. Currently, the active senior district overlay occurs southwest of the intersection of North Avenue and North Main Street, running south behind parcels fronting the western side of North Main Street, and terminating north of parcels fronting the northern side of Pine Circle. The district is more specifically identified in the following figure entitled "Exhibit A: Jonesboro Active Senior District Overlay."
(f)
Scale. The junction of North Avenue and North Main Street, which is a "gateway point" into the City of Jonesboro, is the current focus of the active senior district overlay. Jonesboro is recognized for its historic downtown, which is characterized by a pedestrian scale. This scale is preserved by height limits inherent in the development intensity assigned to the downtown area on Jonesboro's future development map and development standards of the active senior district overlay. A sense of place will be maintained by adherence to these height limits. Preservation of pedestrian scale is important to the livability and walkability of the downtown area. Height of attached residential buildings shall not exceed four stories, or the highest point of the historic Clayton County courthouse.
(g)
Regulation of uses. Uses permitted by the underlying zoning(s) are unaffected by adoption of the active senior district overlay; the following uses shall be specifically permitted in the active senior district overlay:
(1)
Residential uses: Single-family detached dwelling, site-built;

(Ord. No. 2020-012 , §§ 1, 2(Exh. A), 4-13-2020; Ord. No. 2021-001 , § 1, 1-11-2021)
Sec. 86-118. - Gateway south district overlay.
new
(a)
Factual. In adopting the city's gateway south district overlay zone (the "gateway south district overlay"), the city seeks to redefine its southern limits, which, with a few recent exceptions, is an area that has become a largely one-dimensional "production corridor," with a significant amount of aging buildings of declining value. With the exception of the Tara Boulevard overlay district, the southern portion of the city lacks unifying, quality design guidelines to give it a new vitality and identity. Because Jonesboro has suffered from the general lack of investment characterizing Atlanta's south side, reinforced by a failure of south side incomes and housing values to keep pace with Atlanta's north side, establishment of this new district will serve as an impetus for reinvigorating development in the southern portions of the city and also serve as another source of more diverse, quality housing to supplement the city's aging housing stock.
(b)
Definitions. For definitions of specific terms, refer to Code section 86-62.
(c)
Purpose. The purpose of the gateway south district overlay is to facilitate creation of a vibrant zone, or hub, with an intelligent mix of new commercial, office, residential, and even industrial, uses that, through thoughtful planning and quality design guidelines, will improve the viability of this strategic area of the city. The residential component of this district will help development [of] a more diverse range of quality housing to supplement the city's aging housing stock, including housing options for the 55-year-old plus, active-living demographic. The close proximity of new businesses, offices, and residences will continue to bolster the city's "live here, work here, play here" philosophy. The gateway south district overlay features a specific range of permitted, prohibited, and conditional uses superior to, and independent of, the Tara Boulevard overlay district and other underlying zoning(s) and focused on the thoughtful reinvigoration of this area, in conjunction with the future goals and intent of the city's comprehensive plan.
(d)
Applicability. Unless expressly modified by regulations in this article establishing the gateway south district overlay, the regulations governing the use of land and structures shall be as set forth in the underlying zoning districts and as regulated by other provisions of this Code. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the current architectural design standards shall control development in the gateway south district overlay, unless alternate provisions are adopted in the gateway south district overlay. Exterior architectural design features shall be subject to review and approval by the design review commission. Where a conflict with other city code and ordinance provisions exists, the more restrictive standard shall apply. The gateway south district overlay shall supersede the requirements of the Tara Boulevard overlay and the assembly overlay, wherever they may overlap with its geographical boundaries.
(e)
Geography. The gateway south district overlay occurs along the entire southern city limits and its intersection with Tara Boulevard, South Main Street, and Turner Road, then running north along a line connecting the intersections of Highway 54 and Tara Boulevard, South Avenue and Tara Boulevard, Batiste Park Road and South Main Street, and Elaine Terrace and Turner Road. The district is more specifically identified in the figure entitled "Exhibit A: Jonesboro Gateway South District Overlay," as originally included with the ordinance from which this section is derived.
(f)
Scale. The corridors of Tara Boulevard and, to a lesser extent, South Main Street, serve as the main "gateway points" for citizens approaching the City of Jonesboro from the south, and are the current focus of the gateway south district overlay. Although Jonesboro is recognized for its distinctive and historic downtown, and recent residential and commercial developments to the north of downtown, the southern portion of the city currently suffers from a lack of identity and diversity of uses. A renewed sense of place in the southern portion of the city will be maintained by the strict building quality and use standards in the gateway south district overlay and will serve as a catalyst for other quality future development throughout Jonesboro.
(g)
Regulation of uses. Uses permitted by the underlying zoning(s) are unaffected by adoption of the gateway south district overlay, except as specified below; the following uses shall be specifically regulated in the gateway south district overlay:

(Ord. No. 2021-005 , § 1, 3-8-2021)
Sec. 86-119. - City Center mixed-use district.
new
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the City Center mixed-use district is to facilitate creation of a vibrant zone, or hub, with an intelligent mix of quality commercial, institutional, and residential uses that, through thoughtful planning and quality design guidelines, will improve the viability of this strategic area of the city and complement the Jonesboro City Center. The residential component of this district will help development a more diverse range of quality housing to supplement the city's aging housing stock. The close proximity of new businesses, offices, and residences will continue to bolster the city's "live here, work here, play here" philosophy. The district will promote walkability in the downtown area, where residential uses are incorporated with commercial and institutional uses in a manner that invites use of nearby facilities and services. Designs and development scale that reinforce such integration are preferable to those that isolate residential uses from convenience services and employment opportunities. At the same time, retail and service establishments should be grouped for maximum pedestrian convenience in locations uninterrupted by residential or office/institutional occupancies. Such objectives may also be achieved by vertical separation of residential and office uses from retail and service areas to preserve the street level tradition of the latter uses. The City Center mixed-use district features a specific range of permitted and conditional uses superior to, and independent of, the MX mixed-use district zoning found elsewhere in the city. The district is focused on the thoughtful reinvigoration of this area, in conjunction with the future goals and intent of the city's comprehensive plan.
(b)
Definitions. For definitions of specific terms, refer to Code section 86-62.
(c)
Applicability. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the current architectural design standards shall control development in the City Center mixed-use district, unless alternate provisions are adopted in the City Center mixed-use district. Exterior architectural design features shall be subject to review and approval by the design review commission. Where a conflict with other city code and ordinance provisions exists, the more restrictive standard shall apply.
(d)
Geography. The City Center mixed-use district (CCM) is currently bounded by Lee Street to the east, Smith Street to the south, Fayetteville Road to the west, and the rear of existing parcels fronting Spring Street to the north. The district is more specifically delineated and color-coded on the current version of the City of Jonesboro Official Zoning Map.
(e)
Regulation of uses. The City Center mixed-use district seeks to identify specific types of quality commercial residential, and institutional uses which will support the Jonesboro City Center as a focal point of the city and serve as an impetus for quality development on parcels adjacent to the district. Uses not listed below in the permitted uses section and conditional uses section are not permitted in the City Center mixed-use district.
