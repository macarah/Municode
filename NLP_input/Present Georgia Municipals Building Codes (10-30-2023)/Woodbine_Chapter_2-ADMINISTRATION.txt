Originating department responsibility. The originating department must determine those employees who will be authorized to make purchases under the blanket purchase order. They should use the blanket purchase order number to obtain the item from the vendor. They should also obtain a copy of the vendor counter ticket and forward it to the purchasing office.
(4)
Closing blanket purchase orders. The purchasing office shall close the blanket purchase orders as they expire by writing "complete" on the copies maintained in that office, issuing a new purchase order for the coming period and informing the originating department of the new purchase order number.
(5)
Payment. Payment of the closed blanket purchase order will be made upon receipt of the signed receiving copy from the originating department, and reconciliation of the counter tickets with vendor invoice.
(b)
Requisition not needed. Some vendors may be paid directly by voucher, and no requisition is needed when they are paid for contractual services, fees, or reimbursement of expenditures.
(c)
Emergency purchases.
(1)
Description. Some departments must be able to have access to supplies under emergency conditions (i.e., conditions which adversely and unduly affect the life, health, or convenience of citizens).
(2)
Purchase order number. Obtained emergency purchases, however, must be confirmed with a purchase order. Such purchases during working hours should be approved verbally by the purchasing office in order that a purchase order number can be assigned. That number must be given to the vendor to be used on the invoice he submits to the city.
(3)
Requisition submitted following workday. A requisition for the emergency purchase must be submitted to the purchasing office no later than the following workday. It should indicate the emergency purchase order number and all relevant facts about the purchase.
(4)
Emergency purchases. The city administrator, after consultation with and approval by the mayor, or in administrator's absence, the mayor alone, shall be authorized to approve purchases and services in an emergency situation without regard to the requirements set forth in ordinances and policies, where the immediate procurement of the purchases or services is essential to prevent delays in work undertaken by or on behalf of the city which may vitally affect the life, health, safety or convenience of the city or its citizens.

Sec. 2-251. - Securing of price quotations and bids.
The securing of price, quotations, or bids will be the responsibility of the purchasing office, subject to existing ordinances and other regulations pertaining to purchasing. Prices will be obtained by one of the following methods. Quotes are required on any purchase in excess of $50.00.
(1)
Telephone. The greatest number of prices will be obtained by use of the telephone.
(2)
Request for quotation. A request for quotation form will be used when the purchasing office determines that the cost of an item is relatively high or that an item is difficult to secure. This form is used to permit two or more vendors to furnish prices, in writing. An opening date of the informal bid may be designated on the front of the form.
(3)
Sealed bid. This method will be used on all purchases exceeding $2,000.00, or when legally required or at the discretion of the purchasing officer if it will be advantageous because of price or material. If this method is used, a legal notice stating the pertinent facts of the contemplated purchase will be published in the legal organ. Sealed bids will be opened at the specific time and place as published in the newspaper. Specifications will be drafted by the originating department supervisor seeking the necessary material, and finalized by the purchasing officer in consultation with the department supervisor.
(4)
State department of administrative services. This service utilizes the services of the state purchasing and supplies division. Under this procedure, the city may purchase on any state contract and possibly obtain a lower price due to the volume that the state purchases. The purchasing office maintains a current copy of the Field Purchasing Contracts Manual issued by the state department of administrative services.
(5)
Local vendor preference. Definition: "Local vendor" means a bidder or offeror which operates and maintains a brick and mortar business, i.e. a physical business address, within the limits of Camden County, GA and has a current business license, has paid in full all real and personal taxes owed the city, is considered a vendor in good standing with the city and can obtain an active vendor status.
A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criterion shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a vendor to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified vendors. For purchases, bids, proposals or contracts less than $100,000.00 the local vendor may be given an opportunity to match the lowest price proposal, if the quotation or bid of the local vendor is within five percent of the lowest price proposal by a non-local vendor. In the event a local vendor matches the lowest price proposal, including all other terms, quality, service and conditions, then the local vendor shall be awarded the contract.
