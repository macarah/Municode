Editor's note— Ord. No. 93-28, adopted and effective Oct. 18, 1993, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion of §§ A—P as ch. 11, art. V, §§ 11-101—11-116, was at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 11-101. - General.
This article shall be known as the Stormwater Quality Management Ordinance of Powder Springs, Georgia.
(Ord. No. 93-28, § A, 10-18-93)
Sec. 11-102. - Authority.
The authority for this article is based on home rule provisions of the Georgia Constitution, article IX, section II, paragraph III(a)(6).
(Ord. No. 93-28, § B, 10-18-93)
Sec. 11-103. - Findings.
(a)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety, the welfare of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters.
(b)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(c)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff.
(d)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described above could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include but are not limited to increased water treatment cost, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations.
(e)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
(f)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the city's separate storm sewer system.
(g)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the city's separate storm sewer system.
(Ord. No. 93-28, § C, 10-18-93)
Sec. 11-104. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article include the following:
(1)
To protect, maintain and enhance the short-term and long-term public health, safety and general welfare. This objective will be achieved by providing for regulation and management of the city's separate storm sewer system, including public and private facilities in the city's service area.
(2)
To comply with state (DNR) and federal (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These regulations include:

Controlling the contribution of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system by stormwater discharges associated with commercial and industrial activity and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites of commercial and industrial activity.
b.
Prohibiting illicit connections to the city's separate storm sewers.
