ARTICLE IV. - SITE DESIGN STANDARDS

26-4.01.00 - GENERALLY.
26-4.01.01 - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of article IV is to provide design standards applicable to all development activity within the county. Article IV also provides design standards applicable in specific situations, such as development within overlay districts or development of specific uses that require additional standards to address potential impacts.
(b)
This Code section is intended to:
(1)
Protect property owners and citizens of the county from adverse environmental and economic impact, from adverse health conditions, and from noxious, toxic or other substances or uses that could affect adjoining property owners or those in close proximity.
(2)
Permit uses of land that will not have an adverse economic or environmental impact on adjoining property or property within close proximity thereto.
(3)
Protect and preserve public health, safety, convenience, order and the general welfare of the people of the county. These standards and uses are adopted to allow uses of property consistent with these propositions and to allow users to perform particular functions compatible with adjoining property and property in close proximity thereto without adversely affecting same.
(c)
Application of this Code section.
(1)
Unless modified by grant of hardship variance, these standards shall apply, in addition to the standards of this LDC, and are hereby declared to be the minimum requirements for designated uses of land and structures within the county.
(2)
No variance from these standards will be permitted unless authorized by the planning commission as provided for in article VIII of this LDC.

(b)
No more than one single-family residence may be served by a septic tank.
(c)
Except as specifically provided in the LDC, no lot existing at the time of adoption of the LDC shall be reduced, divided, or changed so as to produce a lot or tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimensional or area requirements of this section.
(d)
Where the owner of a lot of record at the time of the adoption of the LDC, or their successor in title thereto, does not own sufficient land to enable him or her to conform to the lot dimensional or area requirements of the LDC, shall be allowed to build upon said lot in accordance with all other regulations of the applicable zoning district and with the approval of the board of health when such lots utilize a septic tank waste water system.
(e)
Land which is required, dedicated, and accepted for public use is exempt from the requirement of section 26-4.01.01(c).
(f)
Lot width shall be measured at the building line, parallel to the street right-of-way line.
(g)
Impervious surface standards are expressed as the maximum percent of land coverage for each zoning district. The impervious surface ratio is calculated by dividing the total of all impervious surfaces on the lot by the lot area. Impervious surfaces include all buildings, structures, paving and water bodies.
(h)
All lots shall front upon a dedicated public road or a private road meeting the requirements of this LDC, with the exception that an access corridor may be used in accordance with section 26-6.02.06(a) of this LDC.

Where individual septic tanks or other such on-site disposal facilities are to be used as a means of sewage disposal, the county health officer may require increases in the minimum lot size as necessary to conform to rules and recommendations of the state department of public health. In no case, however, shall the lot size be reduced to less than the required minimum as established in this section. Where extreme health hazards are indicated by site characteristics, the county health officer may disapprove the intended use of the lot or require special types of sewage disposal to be constructed as a prerequisite to a lot's being used.
(l)
Cul-de-sac lots or eyebrows shall have a minimum width of lot frontage of 25 feet along the street right-of-way line and a minimum lot width of 75 feet.
(m)
Access on all double frontage lots in residential subdivisions shall be restricted to the lesser used street or the street with the lowest hierarchy in the street classification system.
(n)
Commercial uses on corner lots which have frontage on interior residential subdivision streets shall have access only from the higher level street.
(o)
The owner of lots zoned commercial, office, and institutional shall grant an access easement to each adjoining property that is zoned such for the purpose of improving connectivity between compatible uses.

The approach surface extends 5,000 feet from the end of the runway at an approach slope of 20 feet horizontally for each one foot vertically (20:1). The inner edge of the approach surface (beginning at each end of the runway) is 250 wide, and expands uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet at a distance of 5,000 feet from the end of the runway.
b.
Transitional surface. The transitional surface extends outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and extends at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each one foot vertically (7:1) from the sides of the runway and approach surfaces. The transitional surfaces extend to the point at which they intercept the horizontal surface at a height of 150 feet above the established airport elevation.
c.
Horizontal surface. The horizontal surface is a horizontal plane located 150 feet above the established airport elevation and encompasses an area from the transitional surface to the conical surface. The perimeter is constructed by generating arcs of 5,000 feet in length from the center of each end of the runway surface and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs.
