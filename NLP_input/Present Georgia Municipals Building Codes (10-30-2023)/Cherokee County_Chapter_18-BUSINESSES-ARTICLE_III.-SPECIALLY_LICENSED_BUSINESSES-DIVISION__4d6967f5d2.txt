Sec. 18-301. - Findings of the board of commissioners.
The board of commissioners finds, based on a 1984 study entitled Adult Entertainment Business in Indianapolis, that areas with sexually oriented businesses have higher crime rates than similar areas with no sexually oriented business. Specifically, the board finds that the study reveals that sex-related crimes, defined in the study as rape, indecent exposure, obscene conduct, child molestation, adult molestation, and commercial sex, are much more prevalent in areas where adult entertainment is offered than in areas where no adult entertainment is offered. The same finding is true as to the occurrences of major crimes.
The board of commissioners further finds, based on a May 19, 1986, study from Austin, Texas, entitled Report on Adult Oriented Businesses in Austin, that a severe decline in residential property values may be precipitated by the presence of an adult entertainment establishment, particularly where that adult entertainment establishment is located within one block of residential property uses. Furthermore, the board finds that there is an indication that the introduction of adult entertainment establishments into areas of family-oriented, owner-occupied residential neighborhoods may precipitate a transition to a more transient, renter-occupied neighborhood, which leads to depressed property values and urban blight.
The board of commissioners further finds, based on an October 1980 study of the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, entitled An Analysis of the Relationship Between Adult Entertainment Establishments, Crime and Housing Values, that adult businesses do have a significant and consistent positive correlation with the crime rate index and a negative correlation with the mean single-family housing value. The board of commissioners also finds, based on this study, that adult entertainment businesses should be permitted only in locations that are at least 750 feet, from residential areas and that adult entertainment businesses should not be placed adjacent to one another. The board of commissioners further finds, based on a June 1978 study from St. Paul, Minnesota, entitled Effects on Surrounding Area of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Saint Paul, that the presence of adult entertainment establishments correlates statistically with poor neighborhood conditions. The board finds, based on this study that the location of adult entertainment establishments correlates significantly with neighborhood blight and deterioration.
The board of commissioners further finds, based on a May 25, 1979, study from Phoenix, Arizona, that examined crime statistics and compared areas that have sexually oriented businesses with those that do not, reveals a marked increase in sex offenses in neighborhoods with sexually oriented business, and increases in property and violent crimes, as well.
The board of commissioners further finds, based on a June 1987 study prepared by the Manatee County Planning and Development Department, Manatee County, Florida, which considered research from over 15 cities and counties throughout the United States, conducted between 1977 and 1987, that adult entertainment businesses have a deleterious effect upon property value, particularly residential property, and that sex-related crimes were substantially higher in study areas with adult entertainment establishments compared to control areas without such businesses.
As such, based upon the aforementioned studies, as well as other reports concerning secondary impacts and effects of adult entertainment establishments and sex oriented businesses, including reports entitled, Summaries of Key Reports Concerning the Negative Secondary Effects of Sexually Oriented Businesses, Report To: The American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses and Preventing the Secondary Effects of Adult Entertainment Establishments: Is Zoning the Solution?, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages, leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described hereinabove. The board of commissioners finds that it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the county, as well.
It is also the finding of the board of commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theatres and adult motion picture arcades have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. The board finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the community are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing, shows adult motion pictures, or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities.
Furthermore, based upon oral testimony presented by law enforcement personnel and experts in the field of real property valuation, all of whom are familiar with the secondary conditions resulting in other localities, at the board of commissioner's public hearing on May 18, 2010, the board takes note of the detrimental secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality on the surrounding community, which the board finds do not vary greatly among the various communities within our state and country.
The board of commissioners therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the board finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression.

Sec. 18-302. - Purpose and intent of article.
It is the intent and purpose of this article to regulate the location and operation of adult entertainment establishments as defined herein. This article is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize adverse impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments. The board of commissioners of Cherokee County, Georgia, finds that restricting adult entertainment establishments to commercial and industrial zoned areas and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate such establishments by delineating zones where adult entertainment establishments are most compatible with other uses and the surrounding neighborhood. The board also finds that requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult entertainment establishment uses and other uses will afford the most protection to residential uses. It is not the intent or purpose of the board of commissioners, in enacting this article, to deny any person's right to speech, conduct or expression protected by the Untied States or Georgia Constitutions. In the enactment of this article, the board intends to adopt a content neutral measure to address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
