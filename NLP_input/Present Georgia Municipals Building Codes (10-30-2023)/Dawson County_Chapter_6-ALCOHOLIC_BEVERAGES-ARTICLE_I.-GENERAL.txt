Sec. 6-5. - Fees.
(a)
There is an annual license fee for each type of license. In addition, there are administrative fees to offset administrative and investigative costs which are charged with the initial, renewal, transfer and reinstatement applications for licenses and permits. The fees applicable to all such licenses, permits, and applications shall be set forth in the Dawson County Alcohol Schedule of Fees. Said fee schedule may be modified by the commission periodically as it deems needed and any changes shall be put in written form. An ordinance or ordinance amendment shall not be necessary to change the fee schedule. The fee schedule shall set forth the amount to be paid as a license (annual) fee and the amount of any administrative fee, investigatory fee or other fee as to each type of license. The administrative, investigatory and other fees may be combined in the schedule. There shall be no waiver of fees or parts of fees except in accordance with written policy approved by the county commission. The director shall be responsible to determine fees and shall have authority to decide upon any dispute, question or objection as to the amount payable as fees with an application in order for the application to be considered complete, subject to review by the board of commissioners.
(b)
Each type of license to be issued requires a separate application. Each application for a license shall be accompanied by a certified check in the full amount of the license fee and additional fees. In the event a license application is denied, withdrawn or abandoned, the license fee will be refunded, but the administrative fees are nonrefundable. License fee and administrative fee check shall be delivered to the director or other designee of the board of commissioners with the application and no application shall be deemed complete until all required fees are paid.
(c)
Licenses are valid for not more than one year from date of issue. The normal termination of every license shall be midnight on December 31. If a license is issued prior to July 1 of the year, the full annual license fee shall be payable. If the license is issued July 1 or thereafter, only 50 percent of the license fee shall be payable; the license shall still expire on December 31. All administrative fees are payable regardless of the time of year the application is filed.
(d)
All licenses granted under this chapter shall expire on December 31 of each year unless revoked, surrendered, abandoned or otherwise terminated prior to that normal termination date. Licensees who desire to renew the license shall file applications, with the requisite fee enumerated in the fee schedule, with the designee of the county commission on the form provided for renewal of the license for the ensuing year. Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year. Any renewal applications received after November 30 shall pay in addition to the annual license and administrative fees, a late charge of 20 percent of the total license and administrative fees otherwise payable. If the license renewal application is received after December 31, the late charge/penalty payable shall be increased from 20 percent to 50 percent.
(e)
In the event a license is issued and thereafter abandoned, forfeited, surrendered, revoked, suspended or transferred, no portion of the license fee or administrative fees shall be refunded.
(f)
In the event an application is withdrawn before the license is issued, any sums deposited for license fees will be refunded. Administrative fees will not be refunded.
Sec. 6-6. - Applications and procedures.
(a)
All persons desiring to sell alcoholic beverages shall make application on the form prescribed by the director, which shall include a diagram illustrating distances to the closest example of each type/class of property for which a minimum distance is prescribed in this chapter, and a diagram/site plan illustrating which portions of the parcel (on which the proposed licensed premise is to be located) shall be usable for sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages, such as interior areas, decks, patios, exterior fenced areas, etc. The diagram for on premise consumption licensees shall show the location of each bar, identifying whether it is fixed or mobile, and whether it may include counter service. If the applicant is or will be doing business under a trade name, the application shall include the trade name though the license will be issued to the individual, partnership, limited liability company or corporation in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(b)
If the applicant is an individual, then the application for license shall be in the name of the individual and the license, if issued, shall be issued in that name.
(c)
If the applicant is a partnership or limited partnership, then the application shall be made in the name of the entity; and if a license is issued, then the license shall be issued in the name of the entity or in accord with section 6-9 hereof if section 6-9 applies.
(d)
If the applicant is a limited liability company or a corporation, then the application shall be made in the name of the said limited liability company or corporation; and if a license is issued, then the license shall be issued in the name of the said limited liability company or corporation or in accord with section 6-10 hereof if section 6-10 applies.
(e)
All applicants shall furnish data, fingerprints, financial responsibility and other records as required by the county commission or its designee to insure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The refusal or failure to furnish data, fingerprints, records or information pursuant to such request shall automatically serve to dismiss the application with prejudice.
(f)
The fingerprints provided shall be forwarded to the sheriff's office and/or the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to search for any instance of criminal activity during the two years immediately preceding the date of the application.
(g)
All applications shall be sworn to by the applicant before a notary public or other officer empowered by law to administer oaths.
(h)
A notice of each initial application to sell distilled spirits (whether for package sales or for consumption on the premises) shall be advertised in the official legal organ of the county once during each of two weeks during the 30 days preceding consideration of the application. In the event it is determined at or before the time of consideration that there has been a failure as to publication of the required notice, then the appropriate action will be to delay consideration of the application until proper publication is done. The notice shall contain the name of the applicant, the type of license sought, and the location of the proposed licensed premises, as well as the expected date for consideration (including a statement that such date is subject to change).
(i)
An applicant for any type of license under this chapter, including an employee permit, must resolve any pending alcohol related criminal charges before his or her application will be considered.
(j)
If an applicant is notified of a date, time and place to appear before the county commission or its designee in connection with consideration of an initial application, or a renewal application, or a reinstatement request, or a possible disciplinary action such as suspension, probation or revocation, and the applicant fails to so appear, and if the failure to appear is not excused by the county commission or its designee, then the commission or its designee may deny the application, or may consider the proposed disciplinary action unopposed, or may delay further proceedings as the commission or its designee determines to be appropriate.
(k)
(1)
Consideration of all initial applications and transfer of location applications under section 6-10 of this Code, shall be done by the county commission at an open meeting of the commission unless the commission by written policy, resolution or amendment to this ordinance designates the director or another person or entity to consider and decide such categories of possible actions.
(2)
The county commission shall consider and decide all proposed suspensions, revocations, or other potential disciplinary matters as to any license in an open meeting of the commission, with the exception of emergency suspensions done on a temporary basis, which may be done by the county manager, fire chief, building official or sheriff for public safety reasons under section 6-102 of this Code, until the commission is able to schedule a hearing on the matter for its consideration of the suspension.
(3)
All applicants/licensees shall appear before the commission at the time of its consideration of any of the foregoing matters, either in person, or by the presence of a registered agent who is suitable to answer all questions which may arise concerning the action under consideration. Such appearance by someone other than the agent must be approved in advance by county staff. Failure to appear may result in such action as the county commission or its designee deems appropriate, including delay to allow re-scheduling, or denial of an application or change, or imposition of the proposed disciplinary action.
(4)
Applications for license renewals; special event alcohol permits; transfer of ownership; issuance or disciplinary action as to employee permits; whether a license has been abandoned due to non-use under section 6-11 below; and all other administrative decisions not specifically committed to the discretion of the commission, shall be determined by the director or his or her designee, subject to right of the applicant or licensee or permit holder to appeal an adverse decision to the board of commissioners by filing a notice of appeal stating the grounds for appeal and relevant supporting facts. Notice of appeal must be filed with the director and must be received in the county's planning office within ten business days of the date of the director/designee decision from which complaint/appeal is made. In the event this chapter requires the director to issue a written notice of decision, then the appeal time shall commence on the date when the director's notice is received by the licensee/permittee.
(5)
Notices of all kinds from the director/designee or the commission may be forwarded to licensee/permittee's address of record by hand delivery; or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or by private express delivery with proof of delivery. Notices will be deemed to be received when actually received by licensee/permittee as evidenced by the return receipt signed by licensee/permittee or other person on behalf of licensee/permittee. If hand delivered, the delivery or refusal may be evidenced by the signed statement of the person who delivered or attempted to deliver the notice. If the notice is returned un-delivered because licensee/permittee refused to accept delivery, or failed to pick up a notice despite notice from the U.S. Postal Service or private express carrier as referred to above, or is returned marked "addressee unknown" of "forwarding order expired" then that will be deemed to constitute delivery to the addressee if the notice was addressed to the most current address of record. Refusal to accept shall be deemed delivery of the notice as of the date of refusal, and failure to pick up shall be deemed delivery as of the date of notice of attempted delivery (or the date of final notice if more than one notice of attempted delivery or notice to pick up is given by the U.S.P.S. or private carrier).
(l)
The commission or its designee may table or delay further consideration of an application, disciplinary action, or other matter in order to obtain further information or for other reason if it or its designee deems such tabling or a delay appropriate.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-7. - Granting applications; provisional licenses; special terms and conditions.
(a)
When licenses in accord with the terms hereof are initially issued, if more than one applicant seeks to obtain a license within an area where only one license can be issued, then the board of commissioners shall determine to whom the license shall be issued and may consider the following provisions in addition to the provisions set forth in section 6-9 hereof:
(1)
Whether the applicant owns the property where the licensed business will be located;
(2)
The experience of the applicant operating retail package stores; and
(3)
The distance from the proposed location to any church building, school building, day care facility or alcohol treatment facility with those locations being a greater distance from a church building, a school building, a day care facility or an alcohol treatment facility being given preference if the commission determines such preference to be appropriate.
(b)
In deciding whether or not an application will be granted or denied, the commission may consider the qualifications of the applicant, the location of the business and its proximity to other enterprises. The commission may also consider:
(1)
The effect that the establishment would have on the neighborhood surrounding the establishment in terms of traffic congestion and the general character of the neighborhood, as well as the effect the establishment would have on the value of properties surrounding the site; and
(2)
The number of alcoholic beverage licenses already granted in the neighborhood.
(c)
Approval of an application for a license, renewal of a license, reinstatement of a license, or allowance to continue operation under a license in conjunction with adverse action such as suspension or probation, or in lieu of immediate revocation of proposed or imposed, may be conditioned upon the licensee's agreement to and compliance with conditions provided for by the commission, which may be modified during the course of the term of the license as the commission deems appropriate. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to: substitution of a different licensee, manager or agent; non-participation of a named individual in the ownership, operation or management of the licensed business; restriction of days or hours of operation; modification of the licensed premises or of the portion of the property upon which alcoholic beverages may be sold, served or consumed; changes as to staffing; posting of a bond with adequate security to guarantee compliance with state law and the provisions of this chapter as well as any conditions placed upon any license; conditions as to reporting or record keeping; conditions requiring licensee to clean up trash in the vicinity of the licensed premises on a regular basis; or other reasonable conditions, requirements or restrictions as may be prescribed by the commission.
(d)
Approval of a license may be provisional, that is, temporary and based upon conditions requiring or related to carrying out construction, renovation, alteration or improvement of the proposed licensed premises. Terms and conditions which are hereby imposed automatically on a provisional license are as follows: submittal of plans as required by the director, the building official, the fire department, the health department and any other such official or authority; obtaining all appropriate inspections; payment of all required fees; and securing of all necessary certifications and approvals. Any of the foregoing authorities may impose further reasonable conditions. The licensee may not keep or store alcoholic beverages on site, and may not commence operations, until all such conditions are met.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-8. - Denial of an application.
(a)
The county commission shall provide written notice to any applicant whose application is denied under the provisions of this chapter. Such written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for such denial and shall advise the applicant of the right to appeal under the provisions of this chapter.
(b)
In all instances in which an initial application is denied under the provisions of this chapter, the applicant may not reapply for a license for at least one year from the date of such denial.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-9. - Qualifications of applicants, licensees and resident agents.
(a)
Wholesale. Wholesale licenses shall be issued only to those persons who are licensed by the State of Georgia to sell and distribute malt beverages, wines, or distilled spirits at wholesale.
(b)
Retail package sales and consumption by the drink on the premises. In order to qualify for the issuance of a retail license, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who is not a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The applicant must submit all electronic and other verification forms and identification determined by the director to be applicable. The applicant must not be less than 21 years of age. Applicants may choose to employ or designate a qualified registered agent for the administration of the license, but the agent is not permitted to make the application in place of the proposed licensee.
(2)
If the applicant is a partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, then the provisions of this section shall apply to all its partners, members, officers and majority stockholders. In the case of a corporation, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and the majority stockholder, if an individual. If the majority stockholder is not an individual, then the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and its agent registered under the provisions of this chapter. In the case of a partnership, the license will be issued to all the partners owning at least 20 percent of the partnership; or if no partner owns 20 percent of the partnership, then the general partner, managing partner or the partner with the greatest ownership shall be licensed. In the case of a limited partnership the license shall be issued in the name of the general partner(s). In the case of a limited liability company the license shall be issued jointly in the name of the LLC and its managing member(s), or if there are no managing members, then jointly in the name of the LLC and the individual designated as manager by the LLC in current filings with the Secretary of State.
(3)
If the applicant is an unincorporated nonprofit club, then the managing agent may be an officer of the organization rather than a full-time employee if such managing agent is qualified in accord with this section.
(4)
No person shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license if, during the two years immediately preceding the application, the person has either been convicted of, pled guilty to, pled nolo contendere to, or been released from parole or probation for any of the following offences: any crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances; illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcohol to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation or sodomy; or any sexually related crime. At the time an application is submitted for any alcoholic beverage license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that neither the applicant nor any of the owners of the establishment has been so convicted or released in the two years preceding the application. An applicant's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor, or a violation of a county ordinance shall not, alone, make an applicant ineligible for a license. If, after a license has been issued, any applicant, partner or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, is convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to any of the offenses enumerated herein, then the license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled.
(5)
No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person convicted under any federal, state or local law of any felony, within two years prior to the filing of application for such license.
(6)
It shall be unlawful for any county employee directly involved in the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses under this chapter to have any whole, partial or beneficial interest in any license to sell alcoholic beverages in the county.
(7)
No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who has had any license issued under the police powers of the county previously revoked within two years prior to the filing of the application.
(8)
The county commission may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as set forth in this section for the licensee.
(9)
Any registered agent under this chapter must be an individual who resides in Dawson County and qualifies under the same terms as would an individual applicant for license (that is, all qualifications as to character, criminal and other personal history matters); must consent in writing to serve as resident agent; and must be approved as such by the director. In the event a registered agent ceases to qualify under the terms of this chapter, or the agency is revoked by the licensee, or the agent resigns or declines to continue to serve as agent, the licensee shall notify the director promptly in writing that the individual who has been serving will no longer be agent and shall name another qualified individual residing in Dawson County to serve, subject to the director's approval. As to any proposed initial or replacement agent the applicant/licensee shall be responsible for providing all information, records or data requested by the director for consideration in the approval process.
(10)
All applicants for any alcoholic beverage license must be of good character, and all operators, managers, clerks, or other employees shall be of like character. Corporate or firm applicants shall be of good business reputation.
(11)
A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license if the applicant lacks adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or if the application is intended to serve as a surrogate for a person or persons who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever.
(12)
The county commission may, in its discretion, consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application, agent or the proposed location of the business. If circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the public health, safety, welfare, and morals, then such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.
(13)
For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail himself or herself of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.), as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored if the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-10. - Transferability of license/change in ownership.
(a)
Individuals. In the event of a change of ownership of a business for which an individual has been issued a license, the new owner, if desiring a license, must meet the qualifications specified in section 6-9 and must file an application as provided in section 6-6 and tender with the application the investigative and administrative fee as provided in section 6-5 and any license fee that may be due.
(b)
Partnerships or corporations. In the event of a change of any ownership interest in a business which is owned or operated by a partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, or corporation and for which a license has been issued, the licensee shall report such change to the county commission in writing within five days. "The term "change of ownership interest" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, any change in:
(1)
Division of profits and/or losses;
(2)
Division of net gross or sales;
(3)
Method of paying or amount of rent paid;
(4)
Ownership of leased premises, or buildings or land used in the business;
(5)
Members of a partnership;
(6)
Stockholders of corporate stock; and
(7)
Management.
(c)
If, as a result of any change of ownership interest, the licensee would not qualify under other provisions of this chapter for the issuance of a license, then the license issued to the licensee shall be subject to revocation and shall not be subject to renewal.
(d)
All applications for transfer of a license to a new licensee or new location shall be accompanied by the transfer fee, together with an investigative and administrative fee. If the transfer is not approved, then the transfer fee will be refunded, but the investigative and administrative fee will not be refunded. Ownership changes will be decided by the director, subject to right of appeal to the commission by a dissatisfied applicant, and changes of location shall be decided by the commission.
(e)
Upon the death of a licensee, the executor or administrator of the licensee's estate may continue to operate under the license for the balance of the calendar year without payment of any additional fee or may delegate the operation of the business to another person if the person operating under the license, whether the executor, administrator, or delegate, would otherwise be qualified as a licensee under the provisions of this chapter.
(f)
Any proposed change of location must be approved by the county commission after submission of all required transfer fees, administrative fees and investigative fees, and all information and data required by the director, which shall include, but not be limited to, all location data that would be required on an initial application under this chapter, such as the certified survey showing distances to specified properties, and the floor plan showing the areas designated for storage, preparation, service, display, sales and consumption of alcohol and the location of any bars. The director may also require full current information on the applicant and other persons as for an initial application. The transfer application shall be treated and considered in the same manner as an initial application except there shall be a renewal fee and not a new license fee if the change is to take effect after December 31 of the year the change application is submitted. There will be a transfer fee and no additional license fee if the change is to be effective during the current year. The normal renewal application and fees associated with renewal shall be due notwithstanding pendency of any transfer application under this article. The commission is authorized to consider any factors that might be considered in approving or disapproving an initial application. If the application is for sale of distilled spirits, any notice publication requirements as for new applications shall apply.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-11. - License forfeiture for nonuse.
(a)
A license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid only so long as the licensee is actually engaged in the permitted sale of alcoholic beverages. Any holder of any license under this chapter who shall for a period of 30 days after the license has been issued cease to operate the business and sale of the product or products authorized shall, after the 30-day period, automatically forfeit the license without the necessity of any further action by the county. The director shall cause a notice of forfeiture to be mailed or delivered to the address of record of the licensee, which shall notify the licensee of its right to appeal the decision of the director to the board of commissioners by submitting a notice of appeal. The notice of appeal shall be delivered so as to be received by the director within ten business days of the date of the licensee's receipt of the notice of forfeiture. The notice of appeal shall set forth the grounds of appeal including any relevant facts in support of the appeal.
(b)
A license may be conditionally or provisionally issued for a location upon which the licensee intends to build an appropriate building or renovate an existing structure, and due to the construction or renovation, does not anticipate commencing operations within 90 days of issuance of the license. In the event a license is issued subject to such a condition, the licensee will be determined to have ceased doing business and thus forfeited the license if necessary permits are not obtained and substantial work completed within six months after the date the license is approved. If the licensee has not completed building/renovation, and obtained all required inspections and permits for occupancy, and obtained a business license, and commenced operation of the licensed business within one year following the date of issuance of the license, then the licensee will be deemed to have abandoned the license, which is then forfeited automatically by operation of this section. Provided, however, the holder of any license currently issued and existing as of the adoption of this amendment to the alcohol ordinance, but for which no operations under the license have been commenced, shall have a period of two years from the adoption of the amendment prior to such forfeiture in which to commence operations.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-12. - Licensee requirements.
(a)
Each alcoholic beverage dealer licensed under this chapter shall keep a copy of this chapter upon the licensed premises and shall instruct any person working there with respect to the terms of this chapter; and each licensee, the licensee's agents, and the licensee's employees selling alcoholic beverages shall at all times be familiar with the terms of this chapter. The licensee is responsible for assuring such familiarity and is responsible for any violations committed by any employee or manager due to ignorance of the terms of this chapter or of state law.
(b)
The regulations in this section as to employees and managers shall apply to all establishments seeking and holding a license under this chapter unless specifically provided otherwise:
(1)
No person shall be employed in an establishment holding a license issued under this chapter unless said person meets the following minimum age requirements for issuance of an employee permit:
a.
For employment in an establishment serving alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on-premises, a person must be at least 18 years of age.
b.
For employment in an establishment licensed for sale of distilled spirits by the package for off-premises consumption, a person must be at least 21 years of age. This requirement shall not apply to persons employed solely as a busboy, cook, dishwasher or janitor.
c.
For employment in an establishment licensed for sale of beer, wine or beer and wine by the package for off-premises consumption, a person must be at least 18 years of age. This requirement shall not apply to employees of a grocery store or drug store.
(2)
No person shall be employed in any capacity at an establishment holding a license issued under this chapter until such person has been issued a permit by the director indicating that the person is eligible for such employment.
(3)
No permit shall be issued by the director to any person until such time as a signed application has been filed by such person with the director, and the appropriate fees have been paid, and a search of the criminal record of the applicant is completed. The application shall include, but not be limited to, the name, date of birth, address, citizenship status and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. Applications must be accompanied by a valid government issued I.D. card (for example, a driver's license or state-issued I.D. card).
(4)
The director shall have the search made relative to any criminal record of the person. If there is no record of a disqualifying conviction or of a violation of this chapter, the director shall issue a permit to the person stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the director shall notify the person in writing that the person is not eligible for employment, the cause for such denial, and that such individual has the right to appeal such decision to the board of commissioners.
(5)
No person shall be granted a permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the director that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy or any sexually related crime within a period of two years of the date of application and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not by itself make a person ineligible for a permit required by this chapter. No person shall be granted a permit required by this chapter who has been convicted, pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state or local law for any felony within two years preceding, or any time subsequent to, the date of application and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense where the conviction or plea was entered pursuant to the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.), as amended, so long as the first offender status has not been revoked.

The permit must be either on the premises or in the possession of the individual to whom it is issued while that individual is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be available for inspection by members of the sheriff's office, the director's office or the county code enforcement staff.
(7)
No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the marshal's office for the permit required by this chapter.

(8)
All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the marshal, his designee or by the county commission or its designee.

Licensees are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee required to hold an employee permit by this chapter has a valid current permit at all times while on the premises of the licensed establishment.
(12)

This restriction shall not apply to any location for which a new license is sought if the current licensee has not completed construction of a building or renovation of the licensed premises and is not open for business.
(c)
The minimum distance restrictions set forth in this chapter shall not apply if the retail sale of the same kind of beverage (that is, beer, wine and/or distilled spirits) in the same manner (by the package for off-premises consumption, or by the drink for on-premises consumption) was lawful at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding such application.
(d)
As to any location licensed under this chapter, if the distance requirements in this chapter are or were met at the time of issuance of any license, the subsequent opening and operation of a church building, school building, day care facility, alcohol treatment facility or housing authority property within the minimum distance prescribed in this chapter shall not prevent the continuance of an existing license or the renewal thereof or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such property.
(e)
Nothing in this chapter shall authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages within 250 feet of a polling place during any election at such time as the polls are open.
