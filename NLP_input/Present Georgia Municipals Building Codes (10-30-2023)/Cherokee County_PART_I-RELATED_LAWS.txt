ARTICLE II. - CODE OF ETHICS[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Printed herein is 1991 Ga. Laws, page 411, which created a board of ethics for the county. Amendments to the original act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Section catchlines have been supplied by the editor. Any other additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Section 1. - Findings of fact; purpose of ethical standards.
(a)
It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the Cherokee County government that public officials be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the Cherokee County public officials. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of the Cherokee County public officials, the public interest requires that the General Assembly protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing by law appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of such public officials in situations where a conflict may exist.
(b)
The General Assembly recognizes that an appropriate and effective code of ethics for employees of Cherokee County is also essential for the proper administration and operation of the Cherokee County government. The General Assembly, therefore, urges and expects the commission to provide by ordinance for a code of ethics substantially the same as the one provided by this Act for such employees.
