Sec. 4. - Creation.
Pursuant to Article IX, Section VII of the Constitution of the State of Georgia [Ga. Const. art. IX, Â§ VII], there is created one or more community improvement districts to be located in the City of Oakwood, Georgia, wholly within the incorporated area thereof, which shall be activated upon compliance with the conditions set forth in this section. Each district, if more than one is implemented, shall be governed as directed by this Act. The conditions for such activation shall be:
(1)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the creation of the community improvement district or districts by the governing authority for the City of Oakwood and imposing such conditions on the projects and activities which may be undertaken as will ensure their compatibility with adopted city policies and planning for the area; and
(2)
The written consent to the creation of the community improvement district by:
(A)
A majority of the owners of real property within the given district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the given district; and
(B)
The owners of real property within the given district which constitutes at least 75 percent by value of all real property within the district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. For this purpose, value shall be determined by the most recent approved county ad valorem tax digest.
The written consent provided for in this paragraph shall be submitted to the Hall County tax commissioner, who shall certify whether subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph have been satisfied with respect to such proposed district. The district or districts or respective board or boards created under this Act shall not transact any business or exercise any powers under this Act until the foregoing conditions are met. A copy of such resolutions shall be filed with the Secretary of State and with the city clerk of the City of Oakwood, who shall each maintain a record of the district activated under this Act. Nothing contained herein shall limit the ability of the governing authority of the City of Oakwood to implement more than one community improvement district so long as the requirements hereof and of the Georgia Constitution are satisfied. The provisions of this Act shall be construed so as to provide for the independent application and exercise of all powers for each district contained herein including the ability to levy taxes as outlined herein as separately and independently authorizing and empowering such separate community improvement districts created hereby. Nothing contained herein shall require the governing authority of the City of Oakwood to create more than one community improvement district or to require the creation of a new district if the district boundaries of an existing district are changed, added to, supplemented, or modified.
Sec. 5. - Administration, appointment, and election of board members.
Each district created pursuant hereto shall be administered either by the governing authority or by a board as prescribed under this Act. In the event that a district is to be governed by such a board, the board shall be composed of a minimum of seven board members to be appointed and elected as hereinafter provided:
(1)
Two board members shall be appointed by the mayor of the City of Oakwood and confirmed by a majority of the city council, one of whom shall be a member of the city council, to serve in posts 6 and 7. Three board members shall be elected by the vote of electors, and two members shall be elected by the vote of equity electors. The members representing the electors and equity electors shall be elected to serve in post positions 1 through 5, respectively. Each elected board member must receive a majority of the votes cast for the post for which he or she is a candidate. Votes for posts 1 and 2 shall be cast by electors, and votes for posts 3, 4, and 5 shall be cast by the equity electors. The initial term of office for the members representing posts 1 and 3 shall be one year. The initial term of office for the members representing posts 2 and 5 shall be two years, and the initial term of office of the members representing post 3 shall be three years. Thereafter, all terms of office shall be for four years except the appointed board members who shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing body which appointed him or her. Elected board members shall be subject to recall in the same manner as elected.
(2)
The initial board members to be elected as provided in paragraph (1) of this section shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within 120 days after the adoption of the resolution by the City of Oakwood consenting to the creation of the district and the obtaining of the written consents herein provided at such time and place within the district as the City of Oakwood shall designate after notice thereof shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Hall County as hereinafter provided. Thereafter, there shall be conducted annually, not later than 120 days following the last day for filing ad valorem real property tax returns in Hall County, a caucus of said electors at such time and place within the district as the board shall designate in such notice for the purpose of electing board members to those board member positions whose terms expire or are vacant. If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereof, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held hereunder, notice thereof shall be given to said electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Hall County at least once each week for four weeks prior to such election.
(3)
Board members shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of their duties. They shall elect one of their number as chairperson and another as vice chairperson. They shall also elect a secretary and a treasurer or a secretary/treasurer, either of whom may, but need not, be a member of the board or an elector.
(4)
If the boundaries of a district are subsequently changed after creation of the district to include land within a municipality which was not a party to the creation of the district or, if a municipality's boundaries are changed to include land within an existing district, the governing authority of the municipality shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in Section 9 of this Act. If, by municipal annexation or by deannexation of land from a district, the district no longer includes land within the incorporated area of the City of Oakwood or within a municipality, respectively, then the board member of the district appointed by such governing authority in which the district is no longer located shall cease to be a board member.
(5)
Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. tit. 21, ch. 2], the "Georgia Election Code," shall not apply to the election of district board members. Should a vacancy in office of a district board member occur and the regular caucus of electors is more than six months in the future, a special election shall be called to fill such vacancy, unless it is filled by appointment as hereinabove required. The district board may adopt such bylaws not inconsistent herewith to provide for any matter concerning such elections.
Sec. 6. - Taxes, fees, and assessments.
(a)
The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia; all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes; and all tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property, subject to such limitations as the governing authority for the City of Oakwood may implement with the adoption of a resolution consenting to the creation of said district. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities set forth in Section 2 of this Act which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by the City of Oakwood in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by the City of Oakwood. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as City of Oakwood ad valorem taxes and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of 0.25 percent thereof, but not more than $10,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted as soon as they are acquired by the City of Oakwood to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby.
(b)
The board shall levy the taxes provided for in subsection (a) of this section subsequent to the report of the assessed taxable values for the current calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills, if possible.
(c)
There shall be a segregation of all funds from the levy of taxes, fees, and assessments as described hereunder for the district, and neither the City of Oakwood nor the Hall County tax commissioner shall expend for any purpose not authorized by the board of this district any such taxes, fees, or charges assessed and collected hereunder except for such costs as may be attributed to the billing and collection of such fees, levies, and assessments.
(d)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear the tax millage levied by the district then extant upon such parcel for indebtedness of the district then outstanding until said indebtedness is paid or refunded.
Sec. 7. - Boundaries of the district.
(a)
The boundaries of the district or districts shall be as designated as such by the City of Oakwood as set forth in the resolution required in Section 4 of this Act or as may thereafter be added as hereinafter provided.
(b)
The boundaries of the district or districts may be increased after the initial creation of a district if:
(1)
Written consent of the owners of any real property sought to be annexed is first obtained;
(2)
The board of the district adopts a resolution consenting to the annexation; and
(3)
A resolution is adopted which grants consent to the annexation by the governing authority of such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation.
Sec. 8. - Debt.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Article IX, Section V of the Constitution of the State of Georgia [Ga. Const. art. IX, Â§ V], which debt shall be backed by the full faith and credit and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district; provided, however, that the board and the district may not issue bonds validated under or in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 82, art. 3], known as the "Revenue Bond Law," or in accordance with such other successor provisions governing bond validation generally or as may be provided by law.
Sec. 9. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant hereto may be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board, the governing body of the City of Oakwood, and any municipalities and other governmental authorities or agencies within which the district is partially located. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of the City of Oakwood or any such municipality or any such authority to provide services or facilities within the district, and the City of Oakwood or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or county. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein.
Sec. 10. - Powers.
