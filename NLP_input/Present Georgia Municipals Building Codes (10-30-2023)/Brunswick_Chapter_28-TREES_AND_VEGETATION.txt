new
It is the policy of the city to reduce and restrict the net loss of canopy within the boundaries of the city. The purpose of this article is to establish the standards necessary to assure that this policy will be realized and that the city will continue to enjoy the benefits provided by its urban forest. The provisions of this article are enacted to:
(a)
Establish and maintain the maximum amount of tree cover on public lands in the city by prohibiting the destruction and removal of trees except in accordance with the standards set forth in this article;
(b)
Maintain trees in the city in a healthy and nonhazardous condition through professionally accepted arboricultural practices;
(c)
Establish standards for tree protection during land clearing, construction and redevelopment;
(d)
Providing certain exceptions and exemptions;
(e)
Establish and revise as necessary standards for the planting and maintenance of trees so as to improve the economic base of the city by improving property values, to enhance the visual quality of the city and its neighborhoods and to improve public health by lessening air pollution and the incidence of flooding;
(f)
Minimize hazards and damage to streets and sidewalks and lessen public rights-of-way maintenance costs;
(g)
Provide for the designation of historic and specimen trees;
(h)

(Ord. No. 1067, § 1, 7-15-2020)
Sec. 28-3. - Definitions.
new
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Administrative authority means the city manager for the city, or his or her designee, and may include code enforcement officers, department of public works and engineering, and department of planning, development, and codes.
Building means any structure built for the support shelter or enclosure of person(s), animals, chattel or property of any kind.
Building permit means a permit issued by the department of planning development and codes of the city to proceed with the development or redevelopment of property meeting the requirements as established by the city building code.
Caliper means a standard nursery measurement of the diameter of a tree trunk. The caliper of the trunk shall be taken at breast height (4½ feet) above the ground.
Canopy coverage means the coverage of a tree, by its limbs and leaves, of the ground below. This area may include trees offsite on adjacent properties or public right-of ways where limbs and portions of a tree's canopy overhang onto the subject property. Hazardous and dead or dying trees shall not be used in canopy coverage calculations.
City shall mean City of Brunswick.
City property means all rights-of-way, public parks, public buildings and any easements related to the function of city infrastructure and owned or leased by the city.
City tree registry means a listing of registered trees of special note because of age, size, location, rarity, or historic association.
Critical root zone means the area surrounding a tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival. For a free-standing tree with no apparent root restrictions, the critical root zone shall consist of a circle having a radius extending from a tree's trunk to a point no less than the furthest crown drip line.
Crown drip line means a vertical line extending down to the ground from the end of a tree's longest branches.
Destroy means any intentional or negligent act or lack of protection that is more likely than not to cause a tree to die within a period of five years, as determined by the city forester or city arborist. Such acts include, but are not limited to: performing grade changes (including lowering or filling the grade) that affect more than 20 percent of the root save area; trenching of roots; cutting, girdling or inflicting other severe mechanical injury to the trunk, roots or other vital sections of the tree; removing in excess of 20 percent of the live crown of the tree; inflicting damage upon the root system of a tree by the application of toxic substances, including solvents, oils, gasoline and diesel fuel; causing damage by the operation of heavy machinery; causing damage by the storage of materials; and/or deliberately or negligently burning or setting fire to a tree. In addition, topping, tipping, or any similar improper pruning practices will automatically be deemed as destruction of a tree.
Diameter at breast height (DBH) means the diameter of the main stem of a tree or the combined diameters of a multi-stemmed tree as measured 4½ feet above the natural grade at the base. The top diameter of a stump less than 4½ feet tall shall be considered the "DBH" of an illegally destroyed tree for the purpose of calculating recompense.
Disease means any fungal, bacterial, or viral infection that will result in the death of the tree, as determined by the city forester or city arborist. Disease shall also mean any fungal, bacterial or viral infection that has progressed to the point where treatment will not prevent the death of the tree, as determined by the city forester or city arborist. In order for the city forester or city arborist to deem that a tree has a disease, the person requesting such determination must present a lab report identifying and presenting the etiology (the cause and origin) of the fungal, bacterial or viral infection.
Drip line means vertical line from the horizontal extremity of the canopy of a tree to the ground. For trees with canopies set off center, the drip line will be projected based on the average diameter of the existing drip line using the tree trunk as its point of origin.
Exempt tree means any tree less than six inches caliper or of an undesirable species, such as an invasive species.
Flush cutting means the removal of limbs by cutting immediately adjacent to the trunk, destroying the protective branch collar, and exposing the trunk to decay organisms.
Hardship means a unique or otherwise special existing condition that is not addressed by the chapter.
Hazard tree means a tree with uncorrectable defects severe enough to pose present danger to people or buildings under normal conditions, as determined by the administrative authority
Historic tree means any protected tree which has such unique and intrinsic value to the general public because of its size, age, form, location, historic association, or ecological value as to justify this classification. Any tree in the city selected and duly designated a Georgia State Champion, United States Champion, or a World Champion by the American Forestry Association, or listed in the city's tree registry shall likewise be deemed a historic tree. All historic trees shall be deemed a protected tree regardless of existing tree canopy coverage.
Injure means any intentional or negligent act, including various tree climbing practices, spiking, trimming, flush cutting, incursion into a critical root zone, and the use of climbing spurs or gaffs on trees not subject to removal that exposes the cambium of a tree to insects or decay organisms.
Invasive tree means any species, including its seeds, or other biological material capable of propagating that species, that is not native to that ecosystem; whose introduction does or is likely to cause environmental harm; and which have been identified by the US Department of Agriculture, state, county, or the city as an invasive species. For the purpose of this chapter, that list includes but is not limited to the following: Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima); Mimosa(Albizia julibrissin); Camphortree (Cinnamomum camphora); Chinaberry (Melia azedarach); Princesstree (Paulownia tomentosa); Chinese Tallowtree (Triadica sebifera); Tung Oil Tree (Vernicia fordii).
Live Oak means the state tree that has a diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or larger, also identified as Quercus virginiana.
Protected tree means any self-supporting woody or fibrous perennial plant of a species that normally grows to a mature height of 25 feet or greater and will have or has a tree trunk DBH of 18 inches or greater and is not an exempt tree. Replacement trees become protected trees at the time of installation. All specimen and historic trees shall be deemed a protected tree regardless of existing tree canopy coverage.
Pruning means that definition of the term as set forth in both the most recent International Society of Arboricultural pruning standards and guidelines and American National Safety Institute 300.33. At no time shall trimming, topping, tipping or flush cutting of trees be deemed a form of "pruning."
Public property tree means for purposes of this article, where reference is made to a tree being on "public property", the tree shall be deemed to be on public property where at least 50 percent of the flair of the tree, where the tree interfaces with the earth, is located on public property.
Public utility means any publicly, privately or cooperatively owned line, facility or system for producing, transmitting or distributing communications, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil products, water, steam, clay, waste, storm water not connected with highway drainage and other similar services and commodities, including publicly-owned fire and police and traffic signals and lighting systems, which directly or indirectly service the public or any part thereof.
Removal of a tree means any intentional or negligent act which will cause a tree to decline and die, including, but not limited to, such damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree by application of toxic substances, the operation or filling above the root system or around the trunk of a tree, damaging or removing major limbs, roots, or enough canopy volume so that the tree dies, declines beyond recovery, or becomes a hazard to public safety that must be removed.
Replacement tree means any newly planted shade tree required by this chapter, which shall have a minimum trunk caliper of two inches. All replacement trees shall adhere to the current guidelines established by nursery industry standards. Replacement trees become protected trees at the time of installation.
Shade tree means a tree that typically reaches a height of over 25 feet and has an average DBH of six inches or larger.
Specimen tree means a tree, other than exempt trees, with a trunk DBH of 14 inches or greater, unless deemed a historical tree. All specimen trees shall be deemed a protected tree regardless of existing tree canopy coverage.
Tree means any self-supporting woody, perennial plant that has a trunk diameter of two inches or more when measured at a point six inches above ground level and which normally attains an overall height of at least ten feet at maturity, usually with one main stem or trunk and many branches.
Tree board means the board established pursuant to this Code, chapter 2, article V, division 3.
Tree protection area means any portion of a site where existing trees which are proposed to be preserved in order to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the critical root zone of a tree.
Tree protection barrier means a suitable structure designed to restrict encroachment of vehicles and equipment and prevent storage of supplies within the tree protection area and is installed at the perimeter of the tree protection area prior to construction, land clearing, or demolition.
Trimming means cutting a stem to an indiscriminate length, as determined by the city forester or city arborist. While trimming is unacceptable, pruning, the act of cutting stems at nodes, is permissible.
