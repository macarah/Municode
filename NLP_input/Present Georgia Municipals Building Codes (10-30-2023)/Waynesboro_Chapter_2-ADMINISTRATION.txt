The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed.

(c)
The people of this state have the inherent right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people; and at all times they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it.
(d)
The people have a right to expect that every public official will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he represents.
(e)
Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly:
(1)
Treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness, and equality under the law; and
(2)
Avoid conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest.

In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials is adopted.
(b)
Purpose. This code has the following purposes:
(1)
To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
