State Law reference— Code of ethics for governmental service, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1; conflicts of interest, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-10 et seq.

Sec. 2-189. - Purpose.
Recognizing that stewardship of the public interest must be their primary concern, city officials will work for the common good of the people of Alpharetta and not for any private or personal interest, and they will assure fair and equal treatment of all persons, claims and transactions coming before the city council, boards and commissions.
The purpose of this code of ethics is to:
(1)
Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials;
(2)
Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the interest of the city;
(3)
Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the city; and
(4)
Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
(Ord. No. 755, § 1, 4-30-2018)
Sec. 2-190. - Scope.
The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the Charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This article shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the Charter. These laws include, but are not limited to: the United States and Georgia Constitutions; laws pertaining to conflicts of interest, election campaigns, financial disclosures, employer responsibilities, and open processes of government; and city ordinances and policies.
(Ord. No. 755, § 1, 4-30-2018)
Sec. 2-191. - Definitions.
Solely for the purpose of this code of ethics:
City official or official, unless otherwise expressly defined does not include city employees but does mean the mayor and members of the city council. The term "city official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city council as appropriate to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the mayor and/or city council.
Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the city council or other city board or commission, as well as the discussions or deliberations of the council, board, or commission which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body.
Employee means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the city.
Financial interest means any interest which shall yield, directly or indirectly, a monetary or other material benefit to the official, other than the duly authorized salary or compensation for the official's services to the city, or to any person employing or retaining the services of the official or to a person or entity in which the official has a substantial interest.
Immediate family means the spouse, mother, father, grandparent, brother, sister, son or daughter of any city official related by blood, adoption or marriage. The relationship by marriage shall include in-laws.
Incidental interest means an interest in a person, entity or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value.
Reasonably foreseeable means a result or event that can be reasonably anticipated or expected, and is more than hypothetical or theoretical.
Remote interest means an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public.
Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where:
(1)
The interest is ownership of five percent or more of the voting stock, shares or equity of the entity or ownership of $5,000.00 or more of the equity or market value of the entity; or
(2)
The funds received by the person from the other person or entity during the previous 12 months either equal or exceed (a) $5,000.00 in salary, bonuses, commissions or professional fees, or $5,000.00 in payment for goods, products or services, or (b) ten percent of the recipient's gross income during that period, whichever is less;
(1)
The person serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors or other governing board of a for-profit entity other than a corporate entity owned or created by the city council; or
