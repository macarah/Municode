The solicitation of orders combined with a separate transaction to make delivery to the purchaser as a part of a scheme or design to evade the provisions of this article shall be deemed peddling. Visits by sales representatives pursuant to previously arranged appointments with a specific business or person or as a part of an on-going business relationship shall not be deemed peddling.

(Ord. No. 445, § 102, 5-9-2005)
Sec. 34-20. - Purpose.
Peddling by unlicensed peddlers exposes the citizens of the city to fraud and harms legitimate businesses. The city council deems it to be in the best interests of the citizens of the city that a peddler ordinance be enacted in accordance with law. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety and general welfare by regulating peddling, itinerant traders, traveling salesmen and other door-to-door salesmen generally known as peddlers. Such persons typically market magazines, appliances, housewares and other goods and services by going door to door in neighborhoods and business districts. The citizens of the city are sometimes subject to unregulated peddling by questionable organizations or individuals with illegitimate products or no intent to deliver. It is the purpose of this article to regulate peddling in the city to protect the public health, safety and welfare. To achieve this end, this article requires peddlers seek licenses, have background checks and peddle under certain limitations. However, it is not the intent of this article to require legitimate sales representatives, visiting businesses or persons they have already made appointments with or already have a legitimate business relationship with, to get additional licensing. Neither is it the intent of this article to infringe free speech rights or require licensing for persons going door to door for political campaigns, religious proselytizing or other free speech reasons.
