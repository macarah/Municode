Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment;
(2)
An improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public;
(3)
The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; and
(4)
Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic well-being of the city will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business.

Sec. 6-285. - Removal procedure.
(a)
The enforcement officer shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as an abandoned, dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective sign or a sign for which no permit has been issued or which is otherwise in violation of this article. The enforcement officer shall prepare a written notice which shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved and which shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within thirty (30) days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(b)
All notices mailed by the enforcement officer shall be sent by certified mail, with a copy sent by regular mail. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail; provided, however, that if the certified mail receipt is not returned, such time periods shall be deemed to commence three (3) days after the date on which the notice was mailed.
(c)
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign and the occupant of the property. If any of such persons is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises.
(d)
Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the enforcement officer ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the municipal court within ten (10) days after receipt of the notice.
(e)
Notwithstanding the above, in cases of emergency, the enforcement officer may cause the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice.
(f)
Any sign removed by the enforcement officer pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal.
(g)
When it is determined by the enforcement officer that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served. In this emergency situation, the enforcement officer may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and property owner.
(h)
If it shall be necessary for the enforcement officer to remove a sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, he may sell the same at private or public sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are less than the cost of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are more than the cost of removal, such excess shall be paid to the sign owner or property owner.
