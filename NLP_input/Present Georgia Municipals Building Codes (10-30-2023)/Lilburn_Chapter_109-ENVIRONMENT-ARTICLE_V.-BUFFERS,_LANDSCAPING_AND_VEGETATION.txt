Sec. 109-149. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to preserve and enhance the county's natural environment. This is accomplished through the preservation, protection and planting of trees and other landscape material, particularly those trees recognized herein as canopy and understory trees, and the provision of natural and/or planted buffers between dissimilar uses as part of the land development process. The article is intended to further the city's policy that all development sites where trees are most commonly removed will achieve upon project completion a uniform standard related to tree coverage, landscaping and buffers. In addition, trees are recognized for their importance in shading and cooling, noise and wind reduction, prevention of soil erosion, production of oxygen, dust filtration, fostering air quality through carbon dioxide absorption, providing wildlife habitat, and contributing to the aesthetic and economic value of real property.
(b)
This article is also intended to further the city's policy of encouraging all individuals or firms who propose to develop land, and which are required to meet the requirements of this article, to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques (xeriscaping).

Tree protection areas. Prior to the issuance of a development permit, a tree preservation plan shall be prepared and approved for residential subdivisions indicating compliance with the tree density standard of 16 tree density units per acre. Preserved trees shall be grouped together in tree protection areas (including driplines) consisting of at least three trees. Preserved individual 12-inch or greater diameter trees may also receive credit provided they are protected by a tree protection area (including dripline).
(Ord. of 12-1-1999, § 5.2-4; Ord. No. 097-03, 10-13-2003)
Sec. 109-169. - Tree density standard.
On each property for which a tree preservation and/or replacement plan is required, existing trees shall be retained and/or new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed a tree density standard of 16 tree density units per acre, exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer and any trees required to be preserved or planted within a zoning buffer and except any other land area allowed to be excluded by this article. Trees, both existing and new, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site, with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees may be retained or planted for credit within a public street right-of-way if granted authorization by the Gwinnett County department of transportation.
(Ord. of 12-1-1999, § 5.3.1)
Sec. 109-170. - Tree density standard calculation.
(a)
The tree density standard shall be calculated by summing the following credits and dividing by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application (but excluding any acreage included within a zoning buffer and other land area allowed to be excluded by this article).
(b)
Credit for existing trees proposed to be preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in table B, at the end of this section, credit for existing trees. Credit shall be given all trees preserved on a property having a diameter of three inches or more, except trees located in a zoning buffer.
(c)
Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in table C, at the end of this section, credit for replacement trees. Credit shall be given for all new trees replaced on a property except for trees less than one inch in diameter and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. Multitrunked trees shall only be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk and not the cumulative total of the various trunks. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit for satisfying the required tree density standard.
(d)
Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances:
(1)
A total tree density credit not to exceed four times the units shown on table B, at the end of this section, shall be granted by the department for existing 12-inch diameter or greater trees to be preserved.
(2)
Existing trees to be preserved within a minimum yard area (as required by the applicable zoning district) or within a 100-year floodplain shall be granted a bonus credit of 50 percent of the units assigned in table B, at the end of this section, unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer.

Sec. 109-171. - Tree preservation and replacement requirements.
The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be preserved for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard on a property:
(1)
Tree protection areas. The root system within the dripline is generally considered to be the critical root zone. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained.
a.
The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline of the tree or group of trees collectively.
b.
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of the tree protection area.
c.
Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection areas.
(2)
Protective barriers.
a.
Protective tree fencing shall be installed between buffers and tree protection areas and areas proposed to be cleared, graded, or otherwise disturbed on the site, prior to any land disturbance.
b.
All tree protection areas are recommended to be designated as such with "tree save area signs" posted in addition to the required protective fencing. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances.
c.
All tree protection areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree protection area.
d.
All protective tree fencing and all erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbing and construction process, and should not be removed until final landscaping is installed.
(3)
Encroachment. If encroachment into a tree protection area occurs which causes irreparable damage to the trees, the tree preservation and/or replacement plan shall be revised to compensate for the loss. Under no circumstances shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this article, nor shall plan revision activities stop the department from instituting action for violation of this article.
(Ord. of 12-1-1999, § 5.4.1)
Sec. 109-172. - Replacement trees.
Replacement trees proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard on a property shall comply with the following:
(1)
The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration towards species size when mature.
(2)
Trees selected for planting shall be a species listed on Appendix A, at the end of section 109-188, canopy or understory species list of this article. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the international society of arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition, or similar publications. Refer to the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60, 1973) for plant material quality specifications. Refer to the "Manual of Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) or similar publications for information on tree species site requirements.
(3)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor, so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability.
(Ord. of 12-1-1999, § 5.4.2)
Sec. 109-173. - Tree species lists.
Tree species lists are found in appendix A, at the end of section 109-188, of this article. The director is authorized to administratively add and delete species to both lists. Except as specifically approved by the director as a modification, only the trees listed shall be given credit towards meeting the requirements of this article.
(Ord. of 12-1-1999, § 5.5)
Sec. 109-174. - Water-efficient design consideration.
It is the policy of the City of Lilburn to encourage individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this article to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design.
(Ord. of 12-1-1999, § 6.1)
Sec. 109-175. - Principles and techniques of water-efficient landscaping (xeriscaping).
The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows:
(1)
Proper location and design. - locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high water using plants.
(2)
Turf selection - limiting turf areas, and selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region.
(3)
Efficient watering - once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to 10 days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants.
(4)
Soil improvements - loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots.
(5)
Mulching - using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds.
(6)
Plant selection - selecting plants native or suitable to the region according to their watering requirements and optimum locations.
(7)
Maintenance - maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservation such as increasing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells.
(Ord. of 12-1-1999, § 6.1.1)
