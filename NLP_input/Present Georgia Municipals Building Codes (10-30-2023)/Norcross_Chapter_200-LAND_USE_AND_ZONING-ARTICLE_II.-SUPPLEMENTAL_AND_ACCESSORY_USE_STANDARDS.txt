General guidelines and requirements.
a.
Purpose; goals. The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this section are to:
1.
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
2.
Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
3.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
4.
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
5.
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
b.
Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots.
c.
Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an administrative approval or a special use permit shall provide to the Community Development Department an inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The Community Development Department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this section or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the Mayor and Council.
d.
Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection, towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this section; provided, however, that the Mayor and Council may waive these requirements if, in its sole discretion, it determines that the goals of this section are better served thereby.

Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish, or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted sky blue or gray, to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
3.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
4.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
e.
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas are governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations.
f.
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time.

In granting a special use permit, the Mayor and Council may impose zoning conditions to the extent the Mayor and Council concludes such conditions are necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties.
3.
Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer.
b.
Site plan. Each applicant requesting a special use permit under this section shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate professional engineers, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information the city determines is necessary to assess compliance with this section.
c.
Factors considered in granting special use permits. The Mayor and Council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the Mayor and Council may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if, in the sole discretion of the Mayor and Council, the goals of this section are better served thereby:

7.
Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection d., availability of suitable existing towers or other structures of this section.
d.
Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Mayor and Council that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
1.
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
2.
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
3.
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
4.
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
5.
The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable.
6.
Property owners or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate reasonably the applicant's needs.
7.
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
e.
Setbacks and separation.

2.
In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
3.
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
(6)
Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the Mayor and Council notifying the owner of such abandonment. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
