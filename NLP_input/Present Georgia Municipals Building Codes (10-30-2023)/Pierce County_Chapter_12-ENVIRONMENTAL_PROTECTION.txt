State Law reference— Powers, duties and responsibility of department of natural resources to develop minimum standards for protection of wetlands, O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8.

Sec. 12-1. - Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Pierce County Wetlands Protection Ordinance."
(Ord. of 7-5-2005, § 1)
Sec. 12-2. - Intent and purpose.
The wetlands of the county are important to the environment and shall be protected. The purpose of this chapter is to recognize and require adherence to federal regulations and procedures that govern the development of land that contain wetlands within the county. The regulations contained in this chapter are created under the requirement of the Clean Water Act (33 USC § 1344) (CWA). Any of the county government action under this chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. In the event of a conflict between or among any provisions of this chapter, the Clean Water Act or any other ordinance, resolution or regulation of the county, the most restrictive requirement shall apply. It is not the intent of this chapter to regulate individual properties where activities will not impact wetlands and do not require a land disturbing permit.
(Ord. of 7-5-2005, § 2)
Sec. 12-3. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Anaerobic means not having molecular oxygen (O 2 ) present.
Applicant means any person who seeks permission to engage in any regulated activity on any land that contains wetland areas, as those terms are defined herein.
COE means United States Army Corps of Engineers.
Community development director means the director, or his designee, of the county community development department.
Generalized wetlands map means the latest edition of the county maps generated from national wetlands inventory mapping.
Hydrophytic vegetation means any plant growing in water or in soil that is at least periodically anaerobic as a result of saturation; or plants typically found in wet habitats.
Jurisdictional wetlands means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the United States Army.
Jurisdictional wetlands determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetlands boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC § 1344, as amended).
National wetlands inventory (NWI) maps means a series of maps produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service showing the location and classification of wetlands in standard topographical areas. A wetlands inventory area does not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands and shall not serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or wetland delineation.
Regulated activity means any activity that will, or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fills material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Wetlands, as defined by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve temporary or permanent sources of water to cause soil saturation.
Wetlands delineation means the establishment of wetlands boundaries by a representative of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and authority designated by the COE, or the director, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC § 1344), as amended. Wetlands shall be delineated on the basis of hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetlands hydrology, in accordance with the techniques outlined in the COE, Wetlands Delineation Manual (Technical Report Y-87-1, January 1987).
(Ord. of 7-5-2005, § 3)
Sec. 12-4. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
(a)
Wetlands protection district; boundaries; map.
(1)
The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are identified, designated and mapped as wetland areas by the county board of commissioners. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
(2)
The generalized wetlands map and the established wetlands protection district do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and shall not serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries approved by the COE, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this chapter shall not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(3)
The generalized wetlands map is available in the community development department and incorporated by reference.
(b)
Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within an area shown as a wetland on the generalized wetlands map, to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that an individual 404 permit is required.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(c)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited within wetlands shown on the generalized wetlands map:
(1)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
(2)
Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.
(Ord. of 7-5-2005, § 4)
Sec. 12-5. - Benefits.
Important benefits to county citizens that are derived from wetlands protection include:
(1)
Flood control;
(2)
Erosion control;
(3)
Improved water quality due to the retention of sediment, nutrients, and toxic materials;
(4)
Aesthetics;
(5)
Recreational and natural resource education opportunities;
(6)
Open space.
(Ord. of 7-5-2005, § 5)
Sec. 12-6. - Authority and applicability.
(a)
Permits. Terms and provisions of this chapter shall apply to all activities that require the issuance of a land disturbance permit on any real property within the county. No land disturbing permit shall be issued by the community development director without it being determined that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations.
(b)
Site plans. Application for a land disturbing permit within the wetlands protection division shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information:
(1)
A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, and cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings.
(2)
A map of any wetlands boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant.
(3)
Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet.
(4)
The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body.
(5)
Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent.
(6)
Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection system designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials.
(7)
All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology.
(c)
Activities to comply with site plan. All activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan that would alter the amount and velocity of storm water runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the development, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill or remove or change the overall appearance of the development, as proposed, can be amended only with the approval of the community development director. Minor changes such as the realignment of streets or minor alterations to drainage structures and other infrastructure to meet unexpected conditions are exempted from this requirement.
(d)
Exemptions to site plan requirements. The following activities and developments are exempt from the requirements for detailed site plans:
(1)
Single-family detached and duplex dwellings constructed within a subdivision of fewer than five parcels.
(2)
Repairs to a facility that is part of a previously approved and permitted development.
(3)
Construction of minor structures, such as sheds or additions to single-family residences.
(Ord. of 7-5-2005, § 6)
Sec. 12-7. - Administration and enforcement procedures.
(a)
Jurisdictional wetlands shall be protected according to the regulation of the state, COE, Environmental Protection Agency and all other applicable state and federal regulations. Under current federal law and state policy, alterations or degradation of wetlands should be avoided unless it can be demonstrated that there will be no long-term impacts or net loss of wetlands. Any unavoidable degradation or loss must be mitigated through the restoration, creation, enhancement or preservation of other waters of the United States.
(b)
If the applicant can provide to the community development director a valid COE wetlands delineation that verifies that the proposed activity is not located within jurisdictional wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid COE permit or letter that authorized the proposed activity within jurisdictional wetlands, then the community development director shall follow current procedures for issuing a land disturbance permit. If such evidence of compliance with COE permitting requirements is not provided, then the procedures are as follows: the community development director shall consult the generalized wetlands map to assess whether the proposed activity is located in the wetlands protection district or within 100 feet of the wetlands protection district.
(1)
If the community development director determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located in the wetlands protection district or within 100 feet of the wetlands protection district, the community development director shall follow current procedures for issuing a land disturbing permit.
(2)
If the community development director determines that the proposed activity is located in the wetlands protection district or within 100 feet of the wetlands protection district and that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands, a COE jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a land disturbing permit.
(3)
If the COE determines that a permit or letter of permission is required, a land disturbing permit shall be issued only following issuance of a COE permit or letter of permission. If the COE determines that the proposed activity would not require a COE permit or letter of permission, the community development director shall proceed with current procedures for issuing a land disturbance permit based on documentation of the COE determination. If the COE determines that wetlands mitigation is required, the applicant shall perform mitigation in the county, unless such action conflicts with the direction of COE.
(4)
If under any of the provisions of this section a conflict occurs between the community development director and the applicant with regards to the proposed activity being a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands, the applicant shall provide the community development director with the appropriate COE documentation to resolve the conflict.
(c)
Review procedures. The application shall be made to the county inspections and permits division and will be reviewed within 15 days. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval, approval with conditions, disapproval) by the community development director. If the review process is not completed within 30 days, the application is deemed to be approved. Decisions of the community development director may be appealed to the board of appeals.
(Ord. of 7-5-2005, § 7)
Sec. 12-8. - Penalties.
(a)
When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this chapter, the violator may be required to remove the structure and will be subject, upon conviction, to the punishment provided in section 1-9.
(b)
When removal of vegetative cover, excavation, or fill has taken place in violation of this chapter, the violator may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation as far as practicable.
(c)
If the community development director determines that a violation of this chapter also constitutes a violation of any provision of the Clean Water Act, as amended, the community development director shall issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the applicant and/or property owner.
