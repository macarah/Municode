Corner lots. Corner lots shall provide extra width of not less than fifteen (15) feet to meet the minimum street front and street side yard requirements on the lot edges adjacent to all streets. The street side yard of a corner lot shall be along the street frontage having the greatest dimension; therefore, the other frontage shall be considered the street front yard.
J.
Through lots. Through lots are discouraged in subdivisions except along limited access highways, such as interstate highways. Where it is necessary to provide separation of residential development from arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation, lots fronting such features may be platted in greater depth so that dwellings may be set back an additional distance from the arterial or other feature. Such lots may obtain vehicular access from a rear alley or internal subdivision streets and do not constitute prohibited through lots.
K.
Spite strips. The creation of spite strips is prohibited.
L.
Flag lots. The creation of flag lots is prohibited.
Sec. 21-6.1.5. - Underground electric and communication utilities.

This requirement does not apply to high voltage power lines.
B.
Fee in lieu. Except when extreme conditions of underlying rock, the expense to bury overhead utilities is deemed to be unreasonably costly due to the complexity of the work, or other conditions prevent this requirement from being met, the developer may request approval from the city manager for a fee in lieu arrangement meeting the following:
1.
A city fund, known as the "The City of Avondale Estates Utility Conversion Fund" is hereby created. The purpose of said fund is to accept deposits as described herein, along with other funds or grants apportioned by the board of mayor and commissioners, and the use of such funds shall be restricted for the sole purpose of offsetting the cost of projects undertaken by the city that bury or relocate power lines from streets and sidewalks.
2.
Developer shall contribute toward the city's utility conversion fund in lieu of requiring burial of the utilities. Such fee in lieu arrangement shall be based on a cost per linear foot of such underground relocation of utilities established by the board of mayor and commissioners, and it may be adjusted from time to time by city ordinance.
C.
Sequencing. Fee in lieu or burial of utilities shall be done prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy being issued for structures in any phase abutting the right-of-way within which the overhead utilities are situated.

3.
Receiving site.
a.
Receiving site means the entire parcel or lot qualified to receive parking rights from an eligible sending site,
b.
Qualification of a receiving site shall demonstrate the amount of parking proposed on the site is necessary for the proposed use. The receiving site may exceed the stated parking maximums of this division, provided all requirements of the transfer of parking rights are met.

ii.
The area on the receiving site shall be under construction within six (6) months of the sending site (subject lot) receiving a certificate of occupancy.
iii.
If the previous standard is not met, the sending site (subject lot) shall submit a bond equal to one hundred fifty (150) percent of the value of the open space. The bond shall not be released until such a time that the open space is completed on the receiving site.
iv.
The receiving site shall be located within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet of the sending site.
v.
All other open space standards shall be met for the combined open space.
2.

Maintenance guarantees shall be provided for all improvements to be publicly dedicated and/or maintained (e.g.: streets, sidewalks, landscaping) to guarantee the quality and ongoing performance of the installations.
