ARTICLE VI. - DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 68-601. - Applicability.
(a)
This chapter shall apply to all land and water areas within the unincorporated areas of Habersham County, Georgia.
(b)
No building, structure, land, open space or water shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, structurally altered or maintained and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure, land, open space or water unless in conformity with all the regulations of this chapter.
(c)
Within each district, the regulations set forth shall be minimum requirements and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of building, structure or land.
(d)
Within the districts established by this chapter, there exist certain incompatible lots, buildings, structures, signs and uses of land which were lawful before this chapter was adopted but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is the intention of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue in accordance with this chapter. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for variances or for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
( Ord. of 12-21-2020 )
Sec. 68-602. - Nonconforming lots of record.
A single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings or any other permitted building, structure or use may be erected or established and shall be permitted on a nonconforming lot of record, as defined herein, subject to the following requirements:
(a)
The nonconforming lot of record shall comply with Habersham County Health Department requirements for service by a private well or on-site septic tank, or both, for the use existing or to be established on such lot.
(b)
The nonconforming lot of record shall have public access via a public street or it shall abut and have public access to an approved and improved private road as specified in section 68-1727 that connects to a public street. If no access exists and cannot be obtained in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph, a building permit may be issued if the property owner can demonstrate that private access exists via a minimum 30 foot-wide access easement which affords access to and connects with a public street or an approved and improved private road that connects to a public street. An existing recorded easement shall not be extended.
(c)
The placement of buildings or structures or the establishment of uses shall observe the yard dimensions and building setback lines specified for the building or use by the regulations of the district in which the lot is located unless a variance has been granted pursuant to article XII of this chapter.
(d)
section 68-602 shall not apply if there are two or more nonconforming lots of record which abut one another and are under single ownership except that nonconforming lots shall be combined to create a single lot regardless of resulting size to allow for closer compliance with the requirements of this chapter without losing their nonconforming status. The resulting lot regardless of size may then utilize the allowances of section 68-602 for which it qualifies. No building permit shall be issued unless the nonconforming lots of record are replatted or a variance has been granted pursuant to section 68-1202 of this chapter.
(e)
It shall be the burden of the applicant for a building permit to show proof that the property for which a building permit is requested is a "nonconforming lot of record." Proof shall be by a copy of a plat containing book and page reference to recorded deed or a deed recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Habersham County and certified by same as recorded document and showing the date recorded, which shall be submitted with the application for a building permit.
( Ord. of 12-21-2020 )
Sec. 68-603. - Continuance of nonconforming use.
The lawful use of any building, structure, sign or land existing at the time of enactment of this chapter may be continued, subject to the limitations of section 68-604, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter, except that the use of a principal building, structure or land containing a nonconforming use shall not be:
(a)
Changed to another nonconforming use;
(b)
Expanded, enlarged or extended unless such use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such use is located;
(c)
Moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot occupied by such use, except in conformity with this chapter.
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any building, structure or portion thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health upon order of such official. Changes in ownership or tenancy of a nonconforming building or structure are permitted. Any nonconforming use or structure existing at the time of adoption of this chapter which is abandoned, discontinued, vacated, demolished or otherwise not used for a period of 12 consecutive calendar months shall not be reestablished unless it is brought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
( Ord. of 12-21-2020 )
Sec. 68-604. - Reconstruction of damaged nonconforming structures permitted.
With the exception of a nonconforming single-family dwelling or duplex, a nonconforming building, structure, or improvement which is hereafter damaged or destroyed to an extent exceeding 50 percent of the reasonable estimated replacement cost of the structure, building or improvement may not be reconstructed or restored to the same nonconforming use except by approval as a conditional use, in accordance with the procedures of article XIII, section 68-1307.
If any mobile home/manufactured home is damaged or destroyed by fire or other natural disaster, and if said damage or destruction to said mobile home/manufactured home results in destruction of 50 percent or greater of the square footage of the mobile home/manufactured home as it existed prior to the destruction, then any reconstruction of the damaged mobile/manufactured home must comply with the minimum construction standards required by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department.
( Ord. of 12-21-2020 )
Sec. 68-605. - Expansion of nonconforming buildings.
A nonconforming building which contains a conforming use may be expanded, enlarged or extended, provided that any such additions meet the applicable yard and building setbacks, buffer and landscape strip requirements, and all other regulations for the district in which it is located. A single exception is any building which does not conform to the building setback adjacent to an AG, agricultural district. In such cases, said building may be expanded in a manner that encroaches on the setback from any AG district, provided that the existing setback distance of the building from the AG district boundary is maintained and the building addition is constructed no closer to the AG district boundary than the existing building. This section shall not, however, be construed as to authorize the expansion of a nonconforming building for a use which is not permitted by the regulations for the district within which such building is located.
( Ord. of 12-21-2020 )
Sec. 68-606. - Buildings under construction.
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of this chapter.

No existing parcel/tract of land shall hereafter be subdivided and no building shall be erected or use established on any lot which does not meet the minimum lot areas, minimum lot widths, minimum lot depths, minimum lot frontage, natural ground surface, and side yard requirements specified in this chapter.
(c)
No lot shall be reduced, divided or changed in size so that lot width, size of yards, lot area per dwelling unit, or any other requirement of this chapter is not maintained unless said reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is acquired for a public purpose. Prior to approval of building permits, the administrative officer may require the applicant for such permit to submit a slope map and/or topographic survey of the property on which such building is to be located to ensure compliance with this section.
(d)
The maximum lot depth shall not be less than 120 feet. Minimum lot area and width shall be determined by the water and sanitary sewer system available as required in the table below.

2 Installation of septic systems are subject to approval of the Board of Health.
3 Minimum lot width for townhouse development is 100 feet.
4 An additional setback and buffer may be required in accordance with section 68-1002.
5 Side setback for end units only.
6 Additional requirements may be required in accordance with Articles V and X.
Exception: The single exception to the minimum setback requirements, maximum lot coverage, and minimum lot area provision based upon slope is public and semi-public buildings and uses to house communication equipment, pumps, security, or similar such uses, as determined by the administrative officer, located on small parcels that could not normally meet the performance standards in sections 68-607, 68-608, and 68-609.
Note: In cases where no right-of-way has been documented or established, the right-of-way shall be considered to be and the front building setback line shall be measured from a point ten feet from the existing construction limits of the road.
(e)
Any lot having a slope, as defined in section 68-201, of 15 percent or greater shall have a natural buffer of undisturbed soil and vegetation maintained or created along all property lines down slope starting from the rear and/or side property line and moving toward the house and/or installed septic system. The buffer shall be no less than 25 feet wide at any point. The purpose of the buffer is to minimize erosion onto adjacent properties or into streams, rivers, and other waterways.
(f)
Lots utilizing a private septic system and having areas of undisturbed soil and vegetation at the time of final plat approval are subject to the percent of the lot down slope on the building site that is required to be buffered for erosion control (see table in subsection 68-607(h)). However, no lot shall be less than one acre.
(g)
For lots that require a private septic system and have been cleared of vegetation prior to the preliminary plat application or during development, a 25-foot wide buffer for erosion control must be re-established along all property lines down slope from the building site. The minimum lot area shall be as specified in subsection 68-607(h).
(h)
For lots requiring a septic system, the minimum lot area will be based upon the following table which shall determine the minimum lot size permitted, regardless of land use intensity district.
