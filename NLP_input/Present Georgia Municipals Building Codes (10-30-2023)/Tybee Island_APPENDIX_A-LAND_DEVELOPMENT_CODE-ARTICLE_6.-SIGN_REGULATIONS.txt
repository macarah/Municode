Sec. 6-009. - Editor's note to article 6.
No sign structure shall be placed or maintained within the city except in conformity with this sign ordinance. Violations of this article may be punished in the same manner as other violations of the Land Development Code. The city reserves the right to take legal action to remove signs erected in violation of this article, or to otherwise enforce the provisions of this article.
If any provisions or requirements of this ordinance are found to be in conflict with any other provision, requirement of this ordinance or any other applicable governmental law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or other governmental regulation of any kind, the more restrictive rule or standard shall take precedence.
In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the mayor and city council of the City of Tybee Island not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to:
(A)
Balance the right of the individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and
(B)
Further the objectives of the City's Master Plan; and
(C)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; and
(D)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; and
(E)
Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and the image of the city; and
(F)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; and
(G)
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; and
(H)
Promote economic development and tourism; and
(I)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

Area and height size computations. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height for sign restrictions in all zoning districts.
(1)
Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face, of which normal length times width (l × h) will be used for calculating the total area of the sign will be calculated to determine total sign area. This does not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets these or other ordinances or regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(2)
Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
(3)
Computation of height. The height of the sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at average adjacent grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction, or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive on any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
(D)
Residential signs. For all residential uses, only the following signs are hereby allowed.
(1)

Special conditions. Where a principal building is devoted to two or more permitted uses, the operator of each such use may install a wall sign upon his/her proportionate share of the building wall to which the sign is to be affixed. The maximum gross surface area of each such wall sign shall be determined by calculating the proportionate share of the area of the building wall, including doors and windows, to which the sign is to be affixed and applying such proportion to the total permitted wall sign aggregate gross surface area for the building.
(2)
Freestanding signs.
a.
Number. There shall not be more than one freestanding sign for each principal building.
(i)
Exception. Notwithstanding the limitation on one freestanding sign for each principal building, where the principal building is occupied by a "destination marketing organization" as defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 48 or a non-profit promotion and marketing organization funded by or through a destination marketing organization, there may be permitted an additional freestanding sign, provided that the additional sign, viewed as a single freestanding sign, is in accordance with the prescribed conditions and all other applicable codes and regulations, and after special review and approval by mayor and council.
b.
More than one principal use. In the event that there is more than one principal use, the sum total for each sign shall not exceed the maximum size allowed per building. Where the exception in subsection (2)(a) is applicable, regarding the limitation on one freestanding sign for each principal building, the sum total of the two freestanding signs shall be evaluated independently, and the maximum size allowed per building shall be applicable to each sign independently, so that the total sum will be double what it would otherwise be if only one sign were permitted.

(Ord. No. 06-2010, 5-13-2010)
Sec. 6-130. - Severability and conflict.
If any section, subsection, clause or provision of this article shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, subsection, clause, provision or portion of this article which is not invalid or unconstitutional. Where the provisions of this article are in conflict with other ordinances, the most restrictive provision shall be enforced. The enactment of this severability and conflict clause in this article shall not be construed as expressing an intent that the severability and conflict clause contained in the overall land use plan, section 1-050, should not be applicable to this and all other articles. The purpose of the inclusion of this particular severability clause is to emphasize the intention of the mayor and council that in the event any particular provision of this article is held to be invalid, then all other provisions of this article to the fullest extent possible, remain valid and enforceable.
