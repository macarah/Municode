Unless specified, all timeframes listed in this section are intended to represent working days (not calendar days).

Sec. 54-89. - Performance evaluations.
Stephens County government utilizes a performance appraisal system to evaluate performance of individual employees. The type of system utilized is at the discretion of the County, and is subject to change without prior notice.
(1)
Objective. The purpose of the employee performance evaluation is primarily to inform employees of how well they are performing their work and how they can improve work performance. The evaluation may also be used in determining merit raises or bonuses; as a basis for training, promotion, demotion, transfer, or dismissal; or other purposes described in these policies. In no case should employees view performance evaluations as a right of the employee, or as an obligation of the county; rather, they are a management tool to be used at the county's discretion.
Wage increases are not automatic. Employees are hired at a rate that is competitive with what other employers would pay for similar skills. An employee may receive a wage increase based upon the tasks performed and the manner in which they perform these tasks. Budgetary considerations or marginal performance by an employee may result in little or no salary increase.
(2)
Period of evaluation. It is the county's policy to evaluate employee performance (except temporary workers) on a continuing basis, and more formally at periodic intervals. The first such evaluation may normally occur at the end of the employee's probation period. Thereafter, at regular intervals (normally on an annual basis), the supervisor or department head will meet with each employee in a formal performance evaluation session. An evaluation may be conducted for an employee recommended for promotion or special salary increase if no evaluation has been conducted within the past three months.
(3)
The evaluation process. Written performance evaluation forms are usually completed with input by the immediate supervisor, department head, and county administrator. After managerial approval, the written form is presented to the employee as part of a formal evaluation session. This session provides an opportunity for the supervisor and employee to discuss job tasks, comment on performance (both positively and negatively), identify and correct weaknesses, and recognize and encourage strengths. The session is also used to establish standards for the next review process, and discuss approaches for meeting goals. Employees are not eligible for a merit pay raise until the performance evaluation form has been completely processed. Completed forms are maintained in the employee personnel files. Employees are entitled to receive a copy of the performance evaluation upon request.
The employee is requested to sign the evaluation form. This signature verifies only that the evaluation has been discussed with the employee, and does not indicate the employee's agreement or disagreement with the performance rating. If an employee refuses to acknowledge by signature their receipt of the evaluation form, a note by the department head or county administrator describing the refusal will be placed in the employee's personnel file.
If an employee disagrees with any statement in an evaluation, they may submit a written statement to the department head and/or county administrator with ten days following the evaluation. The written statement will become part of the employee's permanent file. This action does not constitute a grievance or appeal; it is merely an administrative procedure requiring no action or response by county management or any of its designees.
(4)
Confidentiality of performance evaluations. Evaluations are confidential, and will be made available only to the employee evaluated, the employee's supervisor, department head, the county administrator, or other designee or the board of commissioners.

Sec. 54-90. - Disciplinary actions.
Stephens County government seeks to resolve performance and conduct problems in the most positive and constructive manner possible. In order for the county to function effectively toward accomplishment of its objectives, it is essential that all employees conduct themselves in a manner that promotes attainment of these objectives. Accordingly, the county has established this policy to identify unacceptable behaviors, and appropriate measures to correct those behaviors, in order to provide employees with the opportunity to continue productive employment with the county. When situations arise which warrant disciplinary action, the guidelines described below will assist in ensuring fair and consistent treatment to all employees.
Progressive discipline is a process in which disciplinary action is taken in degrees of increasing severity. The county advocates progressive discipline when appropriate and applicable. Actions taken will depend on degree and circumstances of violations. Employees who fail to satisfactorily perform assigned duties or who violate established procedures will be disciplined.
The county recognizes five degrees of progressive disciplinary actions, falling into two general categories:
(1)
Reprimand. A reprimand is a formal means of communicating a warning to the employee that a problem exists and must be corrected. It provides evidence that the county has observed a progressive sequence if a more severe form of discipline is applied after a subsequent violation. There are two degrees of formality: an oral and a written reprimand.
a.
Oral. In an oral reprimand, the supervisor verbally explains to the employee that they are being reprimanded, and describes the problem and what must be done to correct the problem.
b.
Written. In a written reprimand, the employee receives a written statement describing the problem, what must be done to correct the problem, and probably consequences of not correcting the problem.
(2)
Adverse action. More serious than a reprimand, an adverse action is taken for any reason by the county or their designee that results in a suspension without pay, demotion, or dismissal.
a.
Suspension without pay. An employee may be suspended without pay by the county. Suspension without pay will not typically exceed 15 days, unless the outcome is partially dependent on a court decision or law enforcement investigation (in which case the suspension is indefinite pending resolution). A regular employee suspended in accordance with the provisions of this policy will be provided with a written notice of suspension. A probation period employee may be suspended without pay or without reason.
b.
Demotion. An employee may be demoted from one pay grade to a lower pay grade for disciplinary reasons if a lower position is open and if the employee is qualified to perform the work at the lower position. A demotion includes a decrease in salary.
c.
Dismissal. An employee may be dismissed for disciplinary reasons when all other alternatives have failed to solve the problem or, in the county's judgment, dismissal is the only appropriate action.
Exceptions to discipline procedures. Occasions may occur when an employee must be immediately removed from the job. This may include a situation where it is likely the employee has committed a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude, or when the employee's continued presence on the job might be dangerous for him or others or be unduly disruptive to operations. In such an instance, the employee should be immediately removed from the job by the department head or county administrator, and the county commissioners contacted for appropriate action.
Causes for disciplinary actions. As an "at-will" employer, Stephens County is not required to give causes of disciplinary action either in these policies nor at the time of an adverse personnel action, nor is the county required to dismiss only for any so-called "just cause". However, county officials feel that effective communications can enhance the efficiency and morale of the organization.
The following list of possible causes for disciplinary actions is intended to represent general reasons that are universally accepted as causes in public sector employers. These reasons are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. The county may discipline for any combination of reasons, for reasons not listed below, or for reasons not specified, at any time, as long as the employee's constitutional protected liberty interests are not violated. These possible causes for disciplinary action include:
(1)
Chronic tardiness or absenteeism;
(2)
Negligence or inefficiency in performing assigned duties;
(3)
Inability or unfitness to perform assigned duties;
(4)
Insubordination;
(5)
Misconduct, or violation of county standards of conduct;
(6)
Commission of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude;
(7)
Conduct reflecting discredit on the county of [or] the department to which assigned;
(8)
Failure to report to work without justifiable cause;
(9)
Political activity which is prohibited by these policies;
(10)
Violation of or refusal to comply with federal, state, or local laws or regulations;
(11)
Violation of any other provision of these policies or any other justifiable reason for discipline.
Although progressive discipline procedures will generally be followed, progressive discipline will not be applied for situations that justify immediate termination of employment. The county reserves the right to omit one or more progressive steps depending on the situation and the facts involved, and to exercise appropriate actions on a case-by-case basis.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § F-2)
Sec. 54-91. - Employee response to disciplinary actions.
Although not required by law to provide employees with reasons or causes for an adverse action, the county may, at its discretion, give the employee a notification of the proposed adverse action five days prior to the effective date of the action. Such notification may contain the following:
(1)
The effective date of the proposed action.
(2)
The specific charges or reasons for the action.
(3)
A statement informing the employee that they may respond to a named official both orally and in writing with three days of receiving the notice of proposed adverse action.
(4)
A warning that failure to respond to the named official will result in waiver of all further appeal rights.
The employee's response must be in person or in writing to the named official with three working days of receiving the notice of proposed adverse action. Failure to respond to the notice within three working days will result in a waiver of all appeals.
After considering the employee's response, the named official may give a written notice of their decision on action to be taken with two days of the effective date of the proposed action. The notice will include a statement outlining any appeal options open to the employee. (The official may postpone the deadline for their response by a specific number of days to conduct further investigation. If the deadline for response is postponed, the effective date of the proposed action as contained in the notice of proposed action should be postponed by as many days.)
The employee response procedure is created to protect the employee from erroneous or arbitrary disciplinary action, as well as to afford the department an opportunity to re-evaluate its position on proposed disciplinary actions and to affirm or correct if necessary. The procedure does not require a full hearing prior to the disciplinary action; if requires only that the employee be given an opportunity to respond to the charges in writing.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § F-3)
Sec. 54-92. - Grievances and appeals.[3]
The purpose of the employee grievance procedure is to provide an orderly process for hearing the grievable claims of employees. The object of the process is to reach a fair and equitable decision in a timely manner. The employee and supervisor should make an effort to resolve any grievance informally before initiating a formal grievance.
(1)
Definition. A grievance is defined as a claim initiated by an employee alleging that the county has:
a.
Unfairly or unlawfully disciplined them in an adverse action which includes suspension without pay, demotion, or dismissal; or
b.
Unlawfully discriminated against them in any other manner; or
c.
Unlawfully deprived them of their liberty interest under the Constitution in a manner other than through an adverse action; or
d.
Applied unlawful or unjust coercion or reprisal to the employee; or
e.
Applied county or departmental policies to the employee in an arbitrary or capricious manner; or
f.
Provided unsafe or unhealthy working conditions; or
g.
Applied other unlawful or unjust practices that adversely affect the employee.
(2)
Nongrievable areas. The following issues are not grievable:
a.
Issues which are pending or have been concluded by other administrative or judicial procedures;
b.
Work assignments which do not result in a demotion or a salary reduction;
c.
Budget allocations and expenditures, and organizational structure, including the persons or number of persons assigned to particular jobs or units, including a layoff which results from a reduction in force;
d.
The content or rating of a performance appraisal, except when the employee can show that he or she has been adversely affected by the appraisal;
e.
The selection of an individual by the county administrator of [or] board of commissioners to fill a position through appointment, promotion, or transfer, except when the employee can show that he or she has been adversely affected because of unlawful discrimination;
f.
Any matter which is not within the jurisdiction or control of the board of commissioners;
g.
Internal security practices established by the board of commissioners;
h.
Decisions, policies, practices, resolution, or ordinances made or passed by the board of commissioners which are not job-related and do not contradict these policies.
(3)
Grievance procedures. Employees must notify the county in a timely fashion of any grievance considered appropriate for handling under this policy. The grievance procedure is the exclusive remedy for employees to challenge adverse employment action. As used in this policy, the terms "timely fashion", "reasonable time", and "promptly" will mean within five working days of the date of the action or event complained of, i.e., within five business days of the adverse actions, discrimination, or other action complained of. For example, with regard to a notice of termination of employment, the grievance must be filed within five business days of the date on which the employee receives notice of the impending termination.
Employees shall not be penalized for proper use of the grievance procedure. However, it is not proper to abuse the procedure by submitting grievances in bad faith or solely for the purposes of delay or harassment, or by repeatedly submitting grievances that a reasonable person would judge to have no merit. Initiation of the grievance procedure by an employee does not limit the right of the county to proceed with any disciplinary action that is not in retaliation for the use of the grievance procedures.
Grievances are to be fully processed until the employee is satisfied, does not file a timely appeal, or exhausts the right of appeal. A decision becomes binding on all parties whenever any employee does not file a timely appeal or when a decision is made in the final step and the right of appeal no longer exists.
Employees who feel they have an appropriate grievance should proceed as follows:
a.
Step one. Within five business days of the action or event which causes the employee to file the grievance, the employee should bring the grievance to the attention of the division head if applicable or directly to the department head. The grievance must be presented in writing on a form which shall be available to all employees at the commission office. If the grievance involves the division head, the grievance is submitted to the department head; if the grievance involves the department head, the aggrieved employee may present their grievance directly to the county administrator.
b.
Step two. Within five business days of the employee's receipt of notice of the decision of the division or department head (or county administrator), the employee may appeal to the county administrator; or initiate the grievance procedure if step one was bypassed. The county administrator may confer with the employee and any other members of management considered appropriate, investigate the issues, and communicate a written decision to all parties involved. The county administrator may extend the time required to investigate and make a decision regarding the matter to a date certain not to exceed 30 days from the date of appeal when deemed necessary to ensure a thorough investigation by notifying all parties in writing. If the employee making the grievance has as their direct supervisor the county administrator, or in the event that the county administrator's conduct or action is the subject of the grievance, the chairman of the board of commissioners shall hear the grievance.
c.
Step three. Within five business days of the employee's receipt of the county administrator's decision, the employee may appeal an adverse decision from step two to the appeal board, consisting of the board of commissioners and two additional responsible individuals appointed. The board of commissioners shall appoint two additional members for each appeal filed. If one or more commissioners abstain from service, the remaining commissioner(s) shall appoint one or more additional persons to complete the five-person panel. Such an appeal must be made in timely fashion using a written format provided for this purpose. The summary of the grievance and decisions made in steps one and two will also be submitted. The appeal board will take the necessary steps to review and investigate the grievance and will issue a written final and binding decision within 15 working days. The appeal board may extend the time required to investigate and make a decision regarding the matter when deemed necessary to ensure a thorough investigation by notifying all parties in writing with 15 working days from when the appeal was submitted. The appeal board shall be authorized (but not required) to hold an evidentiary hearing on the grievance prior to issuing their decision.
Final decisions on grievances will not be precedent-setting or binding on future grievances unless they are officially stated as county policy. When appropriate, decisions will be retroactive to the date of the employee's original grievance.
(4)
Confidentiality. Information concerning any employee grievance is to be held in strict confidence. Employees, supervisors, and any members of management involved in grievance investigations are to discuss details only with those individuals who have a need to know or who are needed to supply necessary background information. The appeals board hearings shall be open to the public, unless the county and the employee mutually agree otherwise.
(5)
Compensation. Time spent by employees in grievance discussions with management during their normal working hours will be considered as time worked for pay purposes.
(6)
Employment pending procedure. Nothing contained herein shall in any way require the county to delay any disciplinary action, demotion, or termination pending final resolution of a grievance. The filing of a grievance or appeal shall not delay the effective date of an employee's demotion, termination, or other adverse action and the county shall have no obligation to place an employee who faces a grievance or appeal on leave (with or without pay). The county administrator may, at his/her sole discretion, delay adverse action pending the grievance or may make such other interim provision as they deem appropriate.

Editor's note— A memorandum dated May 14, 2007, stated the following:
"At the Stephens County Board of Commissioners meeting on January 9, 2007, the Stephens County Employment Handbook was amended as follows:
"Section F-4 (codified here as § 54-92) will now state that Department Heads, as well as probationary and temporary employees, have no property right to their positions and therefore are not subject to this section. ... Please be advised that the grievance and appeal procedures et forth in Section F-4 (§ 54-92) no longer apply to Department Heads and probationary and temporary employees."
