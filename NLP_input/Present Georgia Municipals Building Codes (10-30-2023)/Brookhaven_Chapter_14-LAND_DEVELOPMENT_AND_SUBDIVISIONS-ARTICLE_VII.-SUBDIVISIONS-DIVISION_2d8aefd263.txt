(m)
No wall, fence, sign or other structure shall obstruct passage along a sidewalk or bicycle lane.
(n)
The community development director or designee may approve a variable location, width, and construction material for sidewalks and planted strips subject to the following considerations:

Existing site conditions that would require significant encroachment onto existing single family lots.
(2)
Future road expansions proposed in the city capital improvement program.
(3)
Impact to existing trees including:
a.
Critical root zone encroachments by existing improvements or proposed sidewalk installation that exceed the percentage permitted by the tree ordinance.

(4)
Ability for alternative compliance measures to meet ADA requirements, such as width and slope of required sidewalks.
(5)
Conflict with other development standards of this Code or other existing site conditions that support alternative installation allowances. These other standards or conditions include, but are not limited to, existing utilities, steep topography, stream buffers, cemeteries, right-of-way dedication, etc.
(6)
Should it be determined by the community development director or designee that alternative compliance measures are insufficient to provide adequate tree protection, payment into the sidewalk fund may be accepted pursuant to the rate adopted by the city council.
