The applicant must be a citizen of the United States or a resident alien, and a resident of the county for a period of one year preceding the date of filing the application, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section. No license shall be granted to an applicant who has been convicted under federal, state or local law for a criminal offense involving alcoholic beverages, gambling, crimes involving moral turpitude or tax law violations, or any other conviction, if such conviction tends to indicate that the applicant would not maintain the operation for which a license is being sought in conformity with federal, state or local laws of the city.
(3)
The applicant shall not have had revoked, for cause, such as violation of regulations, or improper operations, within five years next preceding his application, any license issued to him by any city or county in the state, this state, or any other state, to sell alcoholic beverages of any kind.

The applicant shall be either the owner of the premises for which the license is held or the owner of a lease thereon.
(5)
The applicant shall be active in, and solely responsible for the management and operation of, the business for which the license is granted.
(6)
If the applicant is a partnership or corporation, then either a partner, outlet manager or corporate agent must conduct the business on the licensed premises, but such person does not have to reside within the county.
(7)
Any misstatement or concealment of fact in the application shall be grounds for denial of consideration of the application or revocation of any license if this is discovered after the license is granted.

(8)
The city commission, in its discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business; including, but not limited to, any report which may be obtained from the chief of police, or his designee, and the other standards for review of license applications as set forth in section 6-64. If, in the judgment of the city commission, circumstances are such that the granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.
