ARTICLE 18. - PRRRD PLANNED RESIDENTIAL AND RECREATIONAL RESORT DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 1801. - Purpose.
PRRRD districts are intended to establish and provide for a comprehensive planned unit development (PUD) which encourages the best possible site plans and building arrangement for residential and recreational use under a unified plan of development. Such developments are sensitive to, and take into consideration, interrelationships between the natural environment, different architectural styles, relative scales of various structures, and the larger community setting in which the PRRRD is situated.
Sec. 1802. - Boundaries of PRRRD districts.
The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all PRRRD districts within Spalding County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.

A.
Pre-application conference: Prior to filing a formal application for a PRRRD, the applicant shall confer with the administrative officer and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project.

C.
Review and approval of PRRRD application:
1.
An application for approval of a PRRRD is treated as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (rezoning). This is because PRRRD districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well designed PRRRD. Upon approval of the PRRRD, existing zoning must be changed to a PRRRD zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in sections 414 and 2302 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the PRRRD. Approval of PRRRD zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the board of commissioners.
2.
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the PRRRD district (Section 2302). If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the administrative officer the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
Properly revised site development plans.
3.
The official map will then be changed (section 2302). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer.
4.
No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners.
D.
Issuance of building permits: The building official will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See section 408.)
E.
Revision of development plan after approval of plan:
1.
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
2.
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of sections 414 and 2302. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
