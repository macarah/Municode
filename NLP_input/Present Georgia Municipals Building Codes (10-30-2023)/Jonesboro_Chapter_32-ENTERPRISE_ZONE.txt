Chapter 32 - ENTERPRISE ZONE

Sec. 32-1. - Definitions.
In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this section, those terms defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-88-3 are incorporated by reference into this section and made a part hereof.
(Ord. No. 2017-001 , § 1, 1-9-2017)
Sec. 32-2. - Statement of findings.
The mayor and council of the city find that:
(1)
The proposed enterprise zone suffers from widespread pervasive poverty as it is located within portions of Census Tract 0406.12. This block group has at least 15 percent or greater poverty according to the U.S. Census.
(2)
The proposed enterprise zone suffers from general distress and adverse conditions. The economic conditions from 2009 until 2016 have driven many businesses from the proposed enterprise zone and a considerable portion of the buildings in the proposed enterprise zone are vacant, underutilized, or dilapidated. The abandonment and underutilization of these commercial and industrial properties suppresses property values and detracts from the city's productivity and economic vitality.
(3)
The proposed enterprise zone shows block groups with poverty rates less than 14 percent, between 15 percent and 29 percent, and greater than 29 percent poverty.
(Ord. No. 2017-001 , § 1, 1-9-2017)

There is hereby created and established a geographic area known as the Jonesboro Enterprise Zone as herein described in Exhibit A, a copy of which is hereby incorporated by reference, in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 36-88-1, et seq. Exhibit A is maintained in the office of the city manager and is available for inspection during normal business hours. Based on findings of fact in section 32-2 above, the enterprise zone meets the following qualifications of the Enterprise Zone Act: pervasive property, general distress, and general blight.
