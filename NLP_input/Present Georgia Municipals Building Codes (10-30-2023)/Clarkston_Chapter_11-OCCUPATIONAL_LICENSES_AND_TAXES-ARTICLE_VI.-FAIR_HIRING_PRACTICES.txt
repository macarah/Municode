Except for such jobs exempted by section 11-105(a), the city shall observe each of the following fair hiring practices:
(a)
The city shall not solicit or otherwise inquire about the criminal history of an individual in an application for a job.
(b)
The city shall not publish or cause to be published information about a job that states or implies that an individual's criminal history automatically disqualifies the individual from consideration for the job.
(c)
The city shall not solicit criminal history information about an individual or consider an individual's criminal history unless the city has first made a conditional employment offer to the individual. This does not preclude the city from explaining to applicants, in writing, the individualized assessment system that the city uses to consider criminal history.
(d)
The city shall not refuse to consider employing an individual because the individual did not provide criminal history information before the individual received a conditional employment offer.
(e)
The city shall not take adverse action against an individual because of the individual's criminal history unless the city has determined that the individual is unsuitable for the job based on an individualized assessment conducted by the city.

When the city takes adverse action against an individual based on the individual's criminal history, it must inform the individual in writing that the adverse action was based on the individual's criminal history.
(g)
The city shall not inquire about any arrest or criminal accusation made against an applicant which is not then pending against that person and which did not result in a conviction.
( Ord. No. 401, § 1(Attach.), 11-1-16 )

(b)
City council designated covered contracts. The city council may designate any contract for services which it approves as a covered contract regardless of whether or not such contract would otherwise meet the definition of a covered contract under this article and regardless of whether or not the contractor or vendor that proposes to contract with the city would otherwise qualify as a covered employer as defined in this article. Any contract so designated as a covered contract by the city council shall require the employer contracting with the city to refrain from undertaking the conduct prohibited by subsection (c) of this section.
(c)

The employer shall not include any question regarding criminal history on its printed and/or on-line employment application forms.
(2)
The employer shall not make any inquiry into an applicant's criminal history until a conditional employment offer is made to the applicant.
(3)
The employer shall not publish any information regarding a job that states or implies that an individual's criminal history automatically disqualifies him from consideration for a job.
(4)
The employer shall not refuse to consider an application because the applicant did not provide his criminal history prior to receiving a conditional employment offer.
(5)
The employer shall not take adverse action against an individual based on his criminal history unless the employer simultaneously notifies the individual in writing that such adverse action was based on his criminal history.
( Ord. No. 401, § 1(Attach.), 11-1-16 )
Sec. 11-104. - Best practices.
(a)
A contractor participating in a bid process for a contract with the city, whether or not such contractor would otherwise qualify as a covered employer as defined herein, may elect to voluntarily observe the prohibitions set forth in section 11-103(c), and/or one or more of the following fair hiring best practices:
(1)
If a criminal history investigation is required by state and/or Federal law for a position, the background screening will be conducted after the employer has determined that the applicant is otherwise qualified, and the employer has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant.
(2)
The employer's consideration of a criminal history must involve an individualized assessment.
(3)
The written notice of adverse action based on criminal history will include a summary of the results of the employer's Individualized assessment of the applicant's criminal history.
(b)
A contractor's willingness to voluntarily observe fair hiring prohibitions and/or best practices should be presented to the city when bidding on a contract. Such willingness shall be a factor which is considered by the city when deciding the successful bidder for a contract that is not strictly a "low bid" situation. When a contractor voluntarily commits to fair hiring best practices, such practices shall be included in the contract in the same manner contemplated by section 11-103 for covered contracts.
(c)
The city manager shall maintain a list of contractors that have demonstrated a commitment to observing fair hiring practices pursuant to section 11-103(c) and/or have voluntarily submitted themselves to best practices pursuant to this section. The contractors identified on such list shall be given preference when the city enters into a contract for services, whether bidding is required or not.

(a)
The city shall not be required to comply with section 11-102 when hiring a post certified law enforcement officer.
(b)
If a criminal background investigation is required by state and/or federal law for a position, then an employer is not required to follow section 11-103 when hiring for such position, unless such employer voluntarily agrees to do so pursuant to section 11-104.
(c)
When the procurement process does not result in a responsive bid from any contractor that is willing to abide by the terms of section 11-103, the city manager should re-start the procurement process in an attempt to identify a contractor that will meet the requirements of section 11-103 unless the need for such services constitutes an emergency. In case of emergency or when two or more attempts at procurement do not identify a qualified contractor that is willing to abide by the terms of section 11-103, the city manager may issue an exemption to the most responsive contractor that bid on the contract such that the terms of this article will not apply to such contract so exempted.
(d)
Nothing in this chapter limits an employer's authority to withdraw a conditional offer of employment for any lawful reason, including the determination that an individual is unsuitable for the job based on an individualized assessment of the individual's criminal history.
(e)
Public works construction contracts with a value of greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) shall not be subject to mandatory participation in fair hiring practices pursuant to section 11-103.
