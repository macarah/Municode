This does not preclude the city from explaining to applicants, in writing, the individualized assessment system that the city uses to consider criminal history.

The city shall not refuse to consider employing an individual because the individual did not provide criminal history information before the individual received a conditional employment offer.

(b)
City council designated covered contracts. The city council may designate any contract for services which it approves as a covered contract regardless of whether or not such contract would otherwise meet the definition of a covered contract under this article and regardless of whether or not the contractor or vendor that proposes to contract with the city would otherwise qualify as a covered employer as defined in this article.

(4)
The employer shall not refuse to consider an application because the applicant did not provide his criminal history prior to receiving a conditional employment offer.

(3)
The written notice of adverse action based on criminal history will include a summary of the results of the employer's Individualized assessment of the applicant's criminal history.
(b)
A contractor's willingness to voluntarily observe fair hiring prohibitions and/or best practices should be presented to the city when bidding on a contract. Such willingness shall be a factor which is considered by the city when deciding the successful bidder for a contract that is not strictly a "low bid" situation. When a contractor voluntarily commits to fair hiring best practices, such practices shall be included in the contract in the same manner contemplated by section 11-103 for covered contracts.
(c)
The city manager shall maintain a list of contractors that have demonstrated a commitment to observing fair hiring practices pursuant to section 11-103(c) and/or have voluntarily submitted themselves to best practices pursuant to this section.

(c)
When the procurement process does not result in a responsive bid from any contractor that is willing to abide by the terms of section 11-103, the city manager should re-start the procurement process in an attempt to identify a contractor that will meet the requirements of section 11-103 unless the need for such services constitutes an emergency. In case of emergency or when two or more attempts at procurement do not identify a qualified contractor that is willing to abide by the terms of section 11-103, the city manager may issue an exemption to the most responsive contractor that bid on the contract such that the terms of this article will not apply to such contract so exempted.

Nothing in this chapter limits an employer's authority to withdraw a conditional offer of employment for any lawful reason, including the determination that an individual is unsuitable for the job based on an individualized assessment of the individual's criminal history.
