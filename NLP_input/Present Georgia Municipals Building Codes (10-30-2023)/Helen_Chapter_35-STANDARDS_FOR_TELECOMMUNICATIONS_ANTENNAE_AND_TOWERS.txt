( Ord. No. 13-11-01, 11-19-13 )
Sec. 35-2. - Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves for telephonic, radio, television, or personal wireless services. For the purposes of this article the term "antenna" does not include any tower and antenna under 70 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, any device designed for over-the-air reception of radio or television broadcast signals, multi-channel multi-point distribution service or direct broadcast satellite service, or any cable television head end or hub towers and antennae used solely for cable television services.
Director means the city manager or his/her designee.
Governing body means the board of commissioners of the City of Helen. For the purpose of this chapter, the words "city" and "governing body" are one and the same.
Microtelecommunications facilities are those which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing support structures where antennae do not project more than 20 feet above the top of the structure and there are no more than six antennae per site.
Monopole tower means a telecommunications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors.
Telecommunications facilities refers to antennae and towers, either individually or together.
Tower means a structure, such as a lattice tower, guy tower, or monopole constructed as a free-standing structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, on which is located one or more antennae intended for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication. The term includes microwave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers.
Whip antenna means a flexible, vertical rod, or radio antenna that would bend without breaking.
( Ord. No. 13-11-01, 11-19-13 )

( Ord. No. 13-11-01, 11-19-13 )
Sec. 35-4. - Design requirements.
General requirements for all telecommunications facilities set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities addressed by this article.
(1)
Height. No telecommunications facility shall exceed 200 feet in total height.
(2)
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is designed, constructed, and maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director.
(3)
Regulatory compliance.
a.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
b.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
(4)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
(5)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(6)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities.
(7)
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(8)
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public way, public property and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the director.
(9)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(10)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but may not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area providing all other requirements of these regulations are met.
(11)
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
All property necessary to satisfy setback requirements covering the total height of the tower shall be under the ownership or control of the applicant. The requirements for control may be satisfied by lease or rent.
b.
Telecommunication towers must be set back a distance equal to the total height of the tower from any adjacent property line as measured radially from the base of the tower to the property line of the subject property.
c.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided, however, that the director may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential and non-residential structures.
2.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum building setback requirements.
d.
For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ration (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
(12)
Additional requirements for towers.
a.
Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
b.
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
c.
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect any historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
d.
Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
e.
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
