Sec. 13-130. - Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
(a)
Definition. A family and/or medical leave of absence shall be defined as an approved absence available to eligible employees for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave per year under particular circumstances that are critical to the life of a family. Leave may be taken: upon the birth of the employee's child; upon the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care; when the employee is needed to care for a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition; or when the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position because of a serious health condition.
(b)
Scope. An employee may take a total of twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid leave for the reasons specified above during the twelve-month period measured forward from the date any employee's first FMLA leave begins.
If an employee is entitled to paid leave under another benefit plan or policy, which includes but is not limited to short-term disability, unused paid vacation, sick, family or personal leave, the county may require or the employee may elect to take the paid leave first. Such available paid leave will be counted against the FMLA twelve-week unpaid leave entitlement. Unless otherwise required, no employee will be entitled to more than a total of twelve (12) weeks, paid and/or unpaid, for leave which qualifies under the FMLA.
(c)
Eligibility. To be eligible for leave under this policy an employee must have been employed for at least twelve (12) months in total, and must have worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve-month period preceding the commencement of the leave. To be eligible the employee must also work at a facility with fifty (50) or more employees within a seventy-five-mile radius.
(d)
Regulation and condition of leave.
(1)
An employee is entitled to take FMLA leave for the birth of a child, the adoption of a child, or placement of a child in foster care. For the birth, adoption, or placement of a child in foster care, the FMLA leave expires twelve (12) months after the birth or placement.
(2)
An employee is entitled to take FMLA leave to care for a parent, spouse or child with a serious health condition or if the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the job because of a serious health condition. A serious health condition is an injury, illness or impairment that involves incapacity due to inpatient care or continuing treatment.
(3)
For an employee to be entitled to take FMLA for his own serious health condition, he must have a serious health condition as described above and be unable to perform the essential functions of the job because of the condition. The essential functions of a job are the fundamental job duties of the employment position. The county may submit a statement of the essential functions of the job to a medical provider for review.
(4)
Notice.
a.
When the need for leave is foreseeable, such as the birth or adoption of a child, or planned medical treatment, the employee must provide thirty (30) days' prior notice, and make efforts to schedule leave so as not to disrupt county operations. In cases of illness, the employee will be required to report periodically on his or her leave status and intention to return to work.
b.
In cases of a medical emergency or other unforeseeable event, the employee must give the employer notice of the need for FMLA leave within two (2) days of when the need for FMLA leave becomes known to the employee.
(5)
Certification.
a.
The county will require that an employee provide certification of a serious health condition of a family member or his or her own serious health condition.
b.
The county will require medical certification from the health care provider to support a claim for leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent or for an employee's own serious health condition.
c.
All requests for family and medical leaves of absence due to illness require a certificate from a health care provider with the following information: Sufficient medical certification stating: 1) the date of which the serious health condition commenced; 2) the probable duration of the condition; 3) the appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition. In addition, for purposes of leave to care for a child, spouse, or parent, the certificate should give an estimate of the amount of time that the employee is needed to provide such care. For purposes of leave for an employee's illness, the certificate must state that the employee is unable to perform the function of his or her position.
d.
The employee has at least fifteen (15) days to provide the certification of the form provided by the employer.
e.
In its discretion, the county may require a second medical opinion from a physician it chooses. If the first and second opinions differ, the county at its own expense, may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the county and the employee. The county may require subsequent recertification of a reasonable basis.
(6)
Intermittent or reduced leave. If medically necessary for a serious health condition of the employee or his or her spouse, child, or parent, leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced-leave schedule. The employee must attempt to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt the county's operations. Intermittent or reduced leave for the birth, adoption or placement in foster care of a child can be taken only by prior arrangement and approval of the county.
For the case of the care for a parent, spouse or child or for the employee's own serious health condition, the employee will be required to provide certification that the intermittent or reduced leave for the planned medical treatment is medically necessary, the dates for such treatment, and the duration.
If leave is requested on the intermittent or reduced-leave basis, the county may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative position which better accommodates recurring periods of absence or a part time schedule, provided that the position has the equivalent rate of pay and benefits.
(7)
The employee may be required to periodically report on his or her status, which includes the employee's intention to return to work. Once it is clear the employee will not be returning to work, he or she is no longer entitled to any FMLA leave or benefits.
(8)
Spouses who are both employed by the county are entitled to a total of twelve (12) weeks of leave (rather than twelve (12) weeks each for the birth, adoption, or placement of a child or for the care of a sick parent.
(e)
Status of employee benefits during leave of absence.
(1)
The county will continue health care coverage during the FMLA leave on the same terms and conditions as prior to the leave.
(2)
An employee who is granted an approved leave of absence under this policy is responsible for any contribution to the premium rate for his or her health insurance coverage at the same rate the employee was paying prior to the leave, if any. The employee is responsible for arranging to pay the premium contributions during the period of unpaid absence. The employee's monthly contributions to the premium must be delivered no later than the last day of each month as payment for the next month. Failure of the employee to pay the premium portion within thirty (30) days is considered a debt of the employee to the county and the county is entitled to recoup the premium payment from the employee.
(3)
In the event that an employee elects not to return to work upon completion of an approved unpaid leave of absence, the county may recover from the employee the cost of any payments made to maintain the employee's coverage, unless the failure to return to work was due to the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious medical condition or for reasons beyond the employee's control.
(4)
With respect to all other employee benefits, other than health benefits, upon returning to work the employee is entitled to all accrued benefits as of the date the leave commenced. The employee is not entitled to any accrual of seniority or other employee benefits during the leave period. Benefit entitlement based upon length of service will be calculated as of the last paid workday prior to the start of the unpaid leave of absence.
Where it is necessary for the employer to continue any premium or other contribution to ensure the equivalent level of benefits upon the employee's return (for benefits other than health benefits), the employer may recoup those premiums or other contributions from the employee whether or not he or she returns to work.
(f)
Reinstatement.
(1)
After a period of FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to return to his or her previous position or an equivalent position with no loss of benefits. There is no obligation of the employer to return the employee to the same position he or she held before the leave.
(2)
A restored employee is not entitled to any right, benefit, or position of employment other than any right, benefit, or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken leave.
(3)
Key employees. A key employee is an employee who is among the highest-paid ten (10) percent of the county's employees within seventy-five (75) miles. If reinstatement of a key employee at the conclusion of the leave period would result in substantial and grievous economic injury to the county, reinstatement to the key employee can be denied.
If it is a possibility that reinstatement will be denied to a key employee, that employee will be provided notice that he or she is a key employee and that rights to reinstatement and continued health benefits could be denied if the reinstatement poses a grievous economic injury to the employer.
Once it is determined that reinstatement would cause grievous economic injury to the county, the employee will be notified in person or by way of certified mail that reinstatement will be denied. At this time the employee will be provided a reasonable time within which to return to work.
FMLA leave and continued health care benefits to a key employee denied reinstatement will be continued for the balance of the leave period unless the employee gives notice that he will not return to work.
(4)
Fitness-for-duty. When an employee has taken FMLA leave for his or her own serious medical condition, an employer may require the employee to provide a fitness-for-duty certificate before returning the employee to work.
(g)
Procedures. Completion of request for family and medical leave of absence form.
A request for family and medical leave of absence form must be originated in duplicate by the employee. This form should be completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to the immediate supervisor for proper approvals, to be forwarded to the Human Resources/ Personnel Department. The form must be submitted thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of the leave when the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable.
When the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, this form should be submitted within two (2) days of when the need for FMLA leave becomes known to the employee.
In all cases where certification is required, the certification form provided by the county must be provided with the request for family and medical leave of absence form.
Copies of all forms can be obtained from the employee's supervisor or the Personnel Department.
