Sections:
15.10.010 - Definitions.
A.
Alarm Permit. A permit issued by the fire department allowing the installation or alteration of an alarm system within the City.
B.
Alarm System. Any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event requiring immediate attention and to which the City's Public Safety Department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms.
C.
Alarm Signal. A detectable signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the City's Public Safety Department is expected to respond.
D.
Alarm User. Any person, corporation, partnership proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning or leasing an alarm system or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises.
E.
Automatic Dial Protection Device. An automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Henry County "911" Emergency Communications Center a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for emergency response.
F.
False Alarm. The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligence of the alarm user, his employees, or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement or emergency personnel unless response was cancelled by the alarm user or his agent before personnel are dispatched to the alarm location. A false alarm shall not include an alarm that can reasonably be determined to have been caused for activated for the first time by unusual conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the Fire Marshall or his designee to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this ordinance when, upon investigation or inspection by a City employee, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, burglary, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted and no fire or other emergency existed in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.
