(a)
Except as set forth in this chapter, no license or permit shall be subjected to a supervised action plan, suspended or revoked without the opportunity for a hearing as hereinafter provided.
(b)
Supervised action plan, suspension or revocation.
(1)
A supervised action plan is an intermediate sanction imposed upon a licensee or permit holder to correct a violation of this chapter under such terms and conditions as set by the mayor or the city council and shall not terminate until the chief of police of the city certifies to the mayor that said terms and conditions have been completed as directed by the mayor or the city council.
(2)
A license or permit may be subjected to a supervised action plan, suspended or revoked where the licensee or permit holder furnishes fraudulent or untruthful information in the application for a license or permit and for failure to pay all fees, taxes or other charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter.
(3)
Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell alcoholic beverages, the city license or permit shall thereupon be automatically revoked. The chief of police, upon notice of this revocation from the mayor, shall take the necessary steps to see that signs are removed and that all alcoholic beverage sales cease.
(4)
Any licensed or permitted establishment, licensee, or permit holder that is found to be in violation of any section of this chapter shall be subject to a hearing before the mayor as set forth hereinafter, and a revocation, suspension, or supervised action plan may thereafter be imposed.

The mayor shall revoke the license of any licensee or permit of any permit holder whose license or permit has been suspended two or more times in any consecutive 12-month period.
(6)
The mayor shall revoke the license for any premises or a permit where alcoholic beverages have been manufactured, distributed, dispensed or sold during a period of suspension.
(7)
The mayor or the city council may mandate a supervised action plan, suspend or revoke any license or permit where the city learns that the license or permit qualifications set forth in this chapter have not been met.
(8)
An act or omission of a licensee; permit holder; owner of more than 20 percent interest in the licensed/permitted establishment; and/or an employee of the licensee, permit holder, or licensed/permitted establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or of any provision of this chapter will subject the license or permit to a supervised action plan, suspension or revocation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, when the mayor or the city council determines that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues; provided, however, in the case of an employee, the mayor or the city council must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee or permit holder, were condoned by the licensee or permit holder, or that the licensee or permit holder has not established sufficient practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring.
(9)
Whenever it can be shown that a licensee or permit holder hereunder no longer maintains adequate financial responsibility upon which issuance of the license or permit was conditioned or whenever the licensee or permit holder has defaulted in any obligation of any kind lawfully owing to the city, the mayor shall issue a supervised action plan, suspend or revoke the subject's license or permit.
(10)
Wherever this chapter permits the mayor to mandate a supervised action plan, revoke or to suspend any license or permit issued hereunder but does not mandate the period of such plan or suspension, such discretion shall be exercised within the guidelines of this section.
(11)
Any supervised action plan may be for a period of time that extends longer than the time remaining on such license or permit. In that event, once the license or permit is renewed, the supervised action plan shall continue as previously imposed. The mayor shall notify the license/permit holder at the time of the approval of the renewal that the supervised action plan will continue into the new license/permit period.
(12)

Any remedial or corrective steps taken by licensee or permit holder;
f.
Any failure by licensee/permit holder to take remedial or corrective steps; and
g.
Whether the situation involves a violation of a supervised action plan and/or suspension previously imposed.
(13)
No supervised action plan nor any suspension of a license or permit shall commence until at least five calendar days subsequent to the issuance of the decision of the mayor or city council to impose such supervised action plan or suspension. This subparagraph shall not apply to any emergency suspension entered pursuant to subsection 4-33(a) herein.

(d)
Determination of deficiencies.
(1)
If the city has cause to believe that the return or returns of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the city by any person is not proper, it may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information that is within or may come into its possession. One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more monthly period.
(2)
The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the due date of taxes.

The city shall give to the licensee or wholesaler written notice of its determination regarding a deficiency. The notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, such service shall be addressed to the licensee at his/her address as it appears in the records of the city.

(4)
Except in the case of failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within 30 days after the tenth day of the month following the calendar month for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within 30 days after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire.

Determination if no return made.
(1)
If any licensee or wholesaler fails to make a return, the city shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in the city which are subject to the tax.

(1)
Examine, or authorize the examination of, books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment, and other facilities of any person subject to the tax, in order to verify the accuracy of any report made, or if no report is made by the operator, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid;
(2)
Require the filing of reports by any person or persons having possession or custody of information relating to the tax herein levied; and
