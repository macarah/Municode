72.7 Permitted Uses. Any use proposed by the developer and considered by the Planning Commission and City Council as being compatible with surrounding districts and the intent of the proposed P.D. District may be permitted. Thereafter, the uses permitted in the district shall be restricted to those proposed, approved, and adopted according to procedures set forth herein.
72.8 General Design Criteria and Development Standards.
(1) Overall site design should be harmonious in terms of landscaping, enclosure of principal and accessory uses, sizes and street patters, and use relationships.
(2) Variety in building types, heights, placement on lots and size of open spaces are encouraged if they are conducive to a safe, healthy and aesthetically pleasing living environment.
(3) The average density for residential dwelling units in a P. D. District should not exceed those set forth in the R-2 District for residential units and C-2 District for commercial uses, although it may be clustered within the P. D. District.
(4) A buffer strip with plant cover, trees and/or an attractive fence should be provided by the P. D. District, unless the adjoining use is compatible. For instance, when one family and multi-family dwellings within a P D District are on property adjoining an R-3 District, then no buffer shall be required.
(5) Within a P D District, the design should include buffers suitable for screening residential areas from commercial or industrial uses when dangers of incompatibility exist.
(6) The sign and parking regulations of this Ordinance should be accepted as minimum standards, and therefore creative improvements are encouraged.
