DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 8-142. - Statement of purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to ensure the public health, welfare and freedom from the use of ostensibly legitimate businesses to further criminal activities such as pandering and prostitution and also to protect minors from involvement with such business practices.
(b)
In enacting this article with regards to licensing, the Mayor and Council recognize that an individual's past actions are very often the best indicators of that person's future actions. Denying licenses to individuals who have recently committed a felony offense or misdemeanor of moral turpitude is a reasonable means to ensure that those licensed to operate escort bureaus or services will respect and abide by these provisions.
