  Sec. 22-618. - Intent.
The city seeks to promote preservation, infill development, and revitalization throughout the city, in its traditional communities, and upon individual blocks and lots. As such, it is the intent of the Victoria Place Overlay District (VPO) to enable, encourage, and qualify the following policies:
(1)
In general and throughout the city:
a.
Implement the comprehensive plan and the Victoria Place redevelopment plan;
b.
Enhance the viability of local businesses and reduce travel demand by focusing growth in existing neighborhoods with infrastructure, services, employment centers, and schools;
c.
Locate workforce housing near job opportunities while avoiding concentrations of poverty;
d.
Establish Thomasville as a city of compact, walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods in which ordinary activities of daily living occur within walking distance of most homes, allowing independence to those who do not drive; and
e.
Create an interconnected network of streets and pathways that are safe and secure for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians; and reduce automobile traffic.
(2)
Within the city's neighborhoods:
a.
Preserve and extend the historic neighborhood character through the design and placement of building types and public spaces; and
b.
Enable mixed-use corner stores and main streets to remain or return as vibrant social and commercial centers.
(3)
At the scale of the block and building:
a.
Use buildings to frame streets and public spaces, resulting in a high-quality, interesting, and human-scaled environment;
b.
Ensure that landmark buildings are sited at important locations, and that they promote a form that reflects their civic stature;
c.
Provide a measure of predictability to property owners and occupants about what may be built on their land or that of their neighbors;
d.
Promote sustainability by encouraging a range of building types and sizes that can readily adapt to changes in the economy, the surrounding community, or the needs of their owner; and
e.
Ensure that architecture and landscape grow from local climate, history, and building practice.
(Code 1991, § 22-500; Ord. of 3-10-2014 , § 1; Ord. No. 11192014-1 , § 1, 11-19-2014)
Sec. 22-619. - General to all development.
(a)
Delineation. The delineation of the VPO is conveyed below and is outlined on the official zoning map of the city.
Victoria Place Overlay District Map
(b)
Base zoning. The VPO overlays three current zoning districts that are referred to as "base zoning."
(c)
State and local codes.
(1)
Except where specifically addressed herein, the standards of the underlying zoning district shall apply. In the case of conflict, the standards of the VPO shall take precedent.
(2)
In the case of conflict between the standards of the VPO and those contained elsewhere in this Code, the standards contained in the VPO shall always prevail.
(3)
Development must comply with all state and local building codes.
(d)
Creating streets. New or improved public or private vehicular rights-of-way, easements, access-ways, and driveways that:
(1)
Will front a building type or civic space type depicted in this Code; or
(2)
Are necessary to maintain or establish an uninterrupted and interconnected network of blocks and streets shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be designed as complete (multi-modal) thoroughfares that incorporate on-street parking, sidewalks, lighting, plantings, streetscape elements (furniture, wayfinding signage, etc.), terminated vistas, and where appropriate, bicycle lanes.
(e)
Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs. Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs shall not be permitted.
(f)
Terminated vistas. In order to improve spatial definition and orientation on each street, terminated vistas shall be encouraged using buildings, civic spaces, roundabouts, statues, ornamentation, or natural features.
(g)
Traffic calming. To the maximum extent practicable, on-street parking shall be encouraged as a means of calming traffic.
(h)
Lot frontage. The primary frontage of a lot shall be along one of the following:
(1)
A thoroughfare right-of-way;
(2)
A thoroughfare with development on one side and a civic space on the other;
(3)
Directly upon a civic space in which there is no thoroughfare located between the primary frontage and the civic space; or
(4)
Directly upon a pedestrian passage or rear alley/lane.
Primary Frontage Located (3 as 1)
(i)
Reverse frontage lots. Reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited. Arterials, collectors, and local streets shall be incorporated into the structure of all future blocks, with access to the first tier of lots provided directly from the thoroughfare, a perpendicular street, or a rear alley/lane.
(j)
Rear alleys and lanes. Rear alleys and lanes shall be provided along the rear property lines of lots intended for new development when the lots are part of a block face with an average lot width of 55 feet or less at the building setback line.
(k)
Exceptions from build-to lines. The zoning administrator may grant an exception to the build-to line requirement in order to avoid one or more trees with a caliper greater than eight inches.
(l)
Exceptions to lot coverage requirements. In the R-2 zone, the required maximum lot coverage shall be 60 percent. If the design is consistent with the intent of this overlay district (section 22-618), the board of architectural review and zoning appeals may grant a variance permitting a proposal for multifamily residential, mixed use, or commercial structures to exceed this percentage.
(m)
Building height.
(1)
Determining overall building height. Building height shall be measured in number of stories from the natural grade or finished grade adjacent to the building exterior to the highest point of coping of a flat roof, the top of a mansard roof, or the highest point of the highest pitched roof.
(2)
Number of stories permitted. The maximum number of stories (floors) is determined by building type. building types are found in section 22-620.
(3)
Ground floor finish level. Minimum and maximum ground floor finish level (measured from adjacent finished grade) are established by building type. Where maximum ground floor finish level exceeds the permitted height, the undercroft (basement, crawl space, or storage area) shall count as a story.
(4)
Half story. A half story is the top floor of a building that has a maximum exterior wall height not to exceed six feet, creating a sloped ceiling on the top level of the structure. Dormers may be used to provide egress windows as required by the adopted building code.
Half Story Depicted
(5)
Appurtenances. Architectural, mechanical, and structural appurtenances may exceed the allowable building height, as conveyed in section 22-622.
(n)
Utilities. To the maximum extent practicable, all utility connections including, but not limited to, electric, phone, cable, etc., shall be placed underground.
(o)
Light impact materials. Where appropriate, the city engineer may approve energy efficient and sustainable materials when utilized as an alternative means of stormwater compliance if they are contextual (see Light Imprint Handbook—Integrating Sustainability and Community Design, v-1.3. DPZ-Charlotte, New Urban Press, 2008) and meet or exceed baseline requirements in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.

(j)
Landmark building.
(1)
Generally. Landmark buildings are designed for occupancy by public or commercial uses that provide important services to the community, including recreation, education, safety, assembly, and related functions. They contribute significantly to the quality of the neighborhood and often serve as the focal point of a civic space, terminate a vista, or are placed at a prominent location. The architectural quality and construction of a landmark building shall be of the highest level and exceed that of nearby buildings.
Landmark Building (2 as 1)
(2)
Review process. Design and disposition (dimensional requirements): All landmark buildings shall be negotiated on a case-by case basis with the supervising planner prior to application.
(3)
Building location. The following criteria should be considered when determining the location of a landmark building within the community, on the block, and on the lot:
a.
Primary function;
b.
Perceived level of importance to the community;
c.
Desired level of formality; and
d.
Sense of permanence.
(4)
Location within the community and block. Buildings shall be sited at prominent locations and oriented toward a public street or public space in a manner that:
a.
Provides a corner or midblock terminating vista;
b.
Anchors a civic space; or
c.
Fronts a street and civic space.
(5)
Location on the lot (setback). Landmark buildings often benefit from being set back from the adjacent build-to lines of private development, thereby:
a.
Allowing the scale of the building to have more visual emphasis; and
b.
Creating a public space in the foreground.
The amount of this setback should be carefully determined based on programming and the urban design objectives of the particular site.
(6)
Multiple buildings/campus. Facilities with multiple buildings or a campus-like setting shall comply with the standards of subsection (k) of this section.
(7)
Building type and character. The following facilities may be designed to an existing building type:
a.
Private and quasi-public clubs or lodges;
b.
Small-scaled cultural facilities such as museums;
c.
Public recreation centers and similar facilities that are minor or secondary in nature; and
d.
Small- to medium-scaled bus passenger stations in which passenger boarding occurs outside the building.
(8)
Inspirational structures. Structures that draw inspiration from an existing building type may be integrated into the urban fabric or streetscape with little to no additional emphasis. All other landmark buildings shall be designed as freestanding, "monumental" structures that evoke pride in one's community and convey a sense of timelessness.
(9)
Vehicle access and parking. To the maximum extent practicable:
a.
Parking shall not be located between a principal or secondary facade and a primary or secondary street;
b.
Parking requirements for the site shall be met with on-street parallel and angled parking spaces, or via a remote parking lot or structure;
c.
Parking shall be accessed from a side street or alley;
d.
Parking drives and access shall be shared with adjacent lots; and
e.
Drop-off, pick-up, and stacking for the site shall occur on or along a public street (may be privately-owned).
If the building is sited in a public space, vehicular access shall be limited to service and emergency vehicles utilizing pedestrian walkways of sufficient width and construction.
(10)
Building design; facades and entrances. A facade that fronts a primary street shall be considered to be the building's principal facade, and a facade that fronts a secondary street shall be considered to be the buildings secondary facade.
a.
The principal facade shall be designed to be the most prominent facade of the building.
b.
Building entrances shall always take access from the most prominent facades.
Additional entrances may be provided along secondary and axillary facades.
(11)
Required frontages. Building fronts shall have at least one of the following: porch, stoop, gallery, colonnade, arcade, terrace, balcony, marquee, canopy, or awning.
(12)
Massing.
a.
Symmetrical in form.
b.
The appearance of a balanced design increases the level of formality, and shall be encouraged.
c.
Massing, while often larger as a whole, should be divided into visually distinct sections.
d.
Massing divisions should provide visual order to the building and create vertical proportions within individual elements.
e.
On corner lots, landmark buildings shall be designed with two facades of equal, though not identical architectural quality.
f.
Landmark buildings located in a civic space shall be designed with four facades of equal, though not identical architectural quality.
(13)
Scale.
a.
Size. In order to be more visually prominent across greater distances, the scale of the building should be larger than that of nearby buildings.
b.
Building height. Three stories maximum, 48 feet above grade maximum (excluding appurtenances).
c.
Story height. Floor-to-ceiling heights and architectural details should be proportionately larger than those of nearby private buildings.
d.
Roof appurtenances. Spires, steeples, towers, cupolas, and belfries can visually extend the height of the building, and shall be incorporated when practicable.
e.
Materials. Buildings shall use durable, high quality materials that convey a sense of permanence. These include, but are not limited to, brick, stone, and cast concrete. Wood construction is appropriate, but should only be executed with the highest quality framing and cladding materials. Generally, stucco should be avoided as a material that lacks scale and texture. If used, stucco should be traditional, have integral pigment, and be scored to define human-scaled dimensions on the facade.
(14)
Specific to churches and places of worship. In addition to the above standards, churches and places of worship shall:
a.
Traditional design. A church should be easily identifiable with timeless features such as bell towers, steeples, clearstory windows, and stained glass integrated into the design. Traditionally designed buildings can be navigated easily based on intuition without much signage. For example, if a sign or large symbol (e.g., cross) is needed to identify the sanctuary then the design can be improved.
b.
Vertical massing. The scale of the sanctuary building should not overwhelm the block. Building features such as arches, columns, pilasters, rooflines (including dormers), and masonry patterns shall divide and create a vertical orientation on larger surfaces. Once these proportions have been established, windows (including clearstory) and doors shall reinforce the vertical orientation of the composition.
c.
Be transparent. Being able to see and hear a little bit of what's going on inside makes a church seem less intimidating and peeks the interest of those passing by. This is the same principal as window-shopping, only adapted to a church. It is not uncommon for people to join a service after hearing music wafting through the doors of a church.
d.
Define entrances. The church's buildings should be open and inviting, with a clear sense of where to enter. In no case shall a church's side doors function as a primary entry point.
e.
Entrances close to pedestrians. Use frontage elements such as porches, stoops, galleries, arcades, and canopies to bring the church up to the street or public space, while still providing an area for people to gather.
f.
Doors. Church doors should be prominent and inviting.
g.
Parking. Parking lots disrupt the neighborhood fabric and discourage members from walking to and from church, resulting in less patronage of local shops and cafes. Parking should be on-street or shared with other commercial or institutional buildings in the vicinity.
h.
Create a community focal point. Add neighborhood-friendly features such as athletic fields, tennis or basketball courts, a playground, an outdoor amphitheater, etc.
i.
Permeable campus. Churches that span more than one block shall ensure that their campus is permeable, allowing people to walk through the property using multiple routes.
(15)
Use. This building type/lot may only house churches or other place of worship; public owned recreation centers, YMCAs and institutions of a similar nature; schools (public or private); business schools; clubs or lodges (private); colleges or universities; cultural facilities; railroad or bus passenger stations; and municipal structures as defined in section 22-626.
(k)
Cottage court.
(1)
Building type.. The cottage court consists of a series of small, detached structures on a single lot, providing multiple interior units arranged to define a shared court that is typically open to, and perpendicular to the street. The shared court takes the place of a private rear and becomes an important community-enhancing space.

Sec. 22-621. - Frontages and building elements.
(a)
Porches and stoops. Porches and stoops provide outdoor living space. Often, they provide protection from the sun, while still permitting breezes to infiltrate the body of the building. They provide architectural interest and delineate the building's entrance. This type is appropriate for residential building types with small setbacks. Typically, the porch or stoop is located in the build-to zone as close to the sidewalk as possible. It is elevated to ensure privacy within the building from those passing by. Stairs may lead directly to the sidewalk or may be side-loaded.

(a)
Review process.
(1)
Review responsibility. Interpretation of these standards shall be the responsibility of the city's planning department. This Code is calibrated to implement the vision conveyed in the Victoria Place Urban Redevelopment Plan (VPURA) while also promoting a form and function that is contextual with the existing neighborhood; a complex place in which no single element dominates, but rather many components come together to create a community. In order to ensure the above outcome, certain requirements in this code may be met using the range of options provided herein, and associated with a specific standard.
(2)
Administrative approval. Where waivers of requirements are permitted in this code, the following shall be utilized in determining the appropriate outcome:
a.
Refer to the goals and intentions conveyed in the VPURA.
b.
Refer to the section 22-618.
c.
The proposed matter should be considered in context with the character of the surrounding community and surrounding land uses and the outcome compatible and consistent with the same.

The applicant is required to obtain a building permit;
shall be reviewed per the standards of this overlay district.

In such case, the principal structure shall be brought into conformance with the standards of the overlay district. Otherwise, to the maximum extent practicable, all lots, structures, uses, and associated architectural elements (signs, fences, etc.) shall comply with the standards of this overlay code.
(7)
Mandatory preapplication meeting. Those wishing to develop in the VPO shall meet with the zoning administrator and/or city planner to discuss the project prior to submitting a formal application. Only the city planner shall have the authority to waive this meeting.
