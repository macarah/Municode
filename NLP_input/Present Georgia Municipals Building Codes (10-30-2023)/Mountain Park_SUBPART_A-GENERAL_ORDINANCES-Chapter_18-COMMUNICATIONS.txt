If the city does not render a written decision, then the application shall be deemed approved.
(k)
If an area is designated solely for underground or buried facilities of communications and electric service providers, then the service providers must not install poles in a right-of-way above ground unless the wireless providers seek a waiver of the underground requirement for placement of a new pole to support small wireless facilities consistent with applicable law.

(c)
The city may require a wireless provider to repair all damage to a right-of-way directly caused by their activities while occupying, installing, repairing, or maintaining small wireless facilities, poles, or support structures, and to restore the right-of-way to its condition before the damage occurred. If the wireless provider fails to return the right-of-way, to the extent practicable within 90 days of receipt of written notice from the city, the city may, at the sole discretion of the city, restore the right-of-way to such condition and charge the wireless provider its reasonable, documented cost of doing so, plus a penalty not to exceed $500.00.
