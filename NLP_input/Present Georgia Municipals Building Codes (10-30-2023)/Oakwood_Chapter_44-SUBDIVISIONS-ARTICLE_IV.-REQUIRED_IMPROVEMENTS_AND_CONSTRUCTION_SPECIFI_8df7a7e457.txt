(a)
Base course construction; general specifications.
(1)
Arterial and collector streets: The base course shall consist of graded aggregate of a minimum compacted thickness of eight inches placed on a stabilized sub-base in accordance with these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grade, and typical cross-section as shown on the drawings approved by the city.
(2)
Minor and dead-end streets: The base course shall consist of graded aggregate of a minimum compacted thickness of six inches placed on a stabilized sub-base in accordance with these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grade, and typical cross-section as shown on the drawings approved by the city.
(3)
Turn lanes and deceleration lanes: The base course shall consist of graded aggregate of a minimum compacted thickness of eight inches placed on a stabilized sub-base in accordance with these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grade, and typical cross-section as shown on the drawings approved by the city.
(4)
Base course construction; materials: All materials shall be secured from Georgia Department of Transportation approved sources.
(5)
Base course construction; preparation of sub-grade: All boulders, organic material, soft clay, spongy material and any other objectionable material shall be removed and replaced with approved material. The sub-grade shall be properly shaped, rolled and uniformly compacted to conform to the lines, grades and typical cross-sections as shown on the drawings approved by the city.
(6)
Base course construction; placing and rolling aggregate: All base course material shall be deposited and spread by means of spreader boxes, or approved mechanical equipment, or from moving vehicles equipped to distribute the material in a uniform layer. Each layer shall be not more than two inches in thickness after compaction and shall be constructed as follows:
a.
Immediately following the spreading of the coarse aggregate, all material placed shall be compacted to the full width by rolling with a smooth wheel power roller weighing seven to ten tons, or an equivalent sheep-foot packer. Rolling shall progress gradually from the sides to the center, parallel with the centerline of the street and lapping uniformly each preceding track by one-half the width of such track, and shall continue until all the surface has been rolled and has been thoroughly keyed, and the interstices of the stone reduced to a minimum, and until it ceases to creep or wave ahead of the roller.
b.
Any irregularities or depressions that develop under such rolling shall be corrected by loosening the material at these places and adding or removing material until the surface is smooth and uniform.
c.
After the coarse aggregate has been thoroughly keyed and set by the rolling described above, screenings in an amount that will completely fill the interstices shall be applied gradually over the surface and rolling shall be continued while the screenings are being spread, so that the jarring effect of the roller will cause the screenings to settle into the voids of the coarse aggregate.
d.
The screenings shall not be dumped in piles on the coarse aggregate but shall be spread in thin layers, either by spreading motion with hand shovels, by mechanical spreading or directly from trucks.
e.
In no case shall the screening be applied so fast or thickly as to cake or bridge on the surface in such manner as to prevent the filling of all voids or prevent the direct bearing of the roller on the coarse aggregate.
f.
Hand brooms shall be used to sweep the screenings into unfilled voids and to distribute the stone where needed. The spreading, sweeping and rolling shall continue until no more screenings can be forced into the void.
g.
Shaping and rolling shall be performed alternately as required to maintain a uniform compacted base until a surface or treatment has been applied to the base.
h.
Along curbs, headers and walls and at all places not accessible to the roller, the base course material shall be tamped thoroughly with mechanical tampers or approved hand tampers.
i.
Base course construction; seasonal limits on construction. No base material shall be deposited or shaped when the sub-grade is frozen or thawing or during unfavorable weather conditions.
(b)
Bituminous plant mix paving.
(1)
Arterial and collector streets: Bituminous plant mix paving shall consist of a minimum of two-inch asphaltic concrete "E" mix placed on top of a minimum of four-inch asphaltic concrete binder "B" mix.

Sec. 44-163. - Driveway construction
(a)
Permit required. An application for permit to construct or alter a driveway or curb cut occurring on or abutting city road right-of-way shall be made to the zoning administrator under the following circumstances:
(1)
When such driveways or curb cuts are incidental to the development of a new structure or the development of previously undeveloped property, the driveway permit shall constitute a part of the building permit.
(2)
When such driveway or curb cut construction constitutes a separate action apart from any other construction on the same site, a driveway permit shall be secured from the zoning administrator.
(3)
When property abutting a city road right-of-way changes from one use to another and driveways and/or curb cuts have previously been extended across or to a city road right-of-way, or when the type of use or the volume of use of an existing and/or previously approved driveway is substantially changed, application for review shall be submitted and a driveway permit secured from the zoning administrator. Occupancy permit may be withheld until such driveway improvements have been approved.
(4)
The island area on the right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder and right-of-way line shall remain unimproved for vehicular travel or parking. Such areas shall be considered as restricted and may be filled in or graded down only as hereinafter provided in subsection (a)(8) of this section.
(5)
The surface of the driveway connecting with rural type highway sections shall slope down and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient amount and distance to preclude ordinary surface water drainage from the driveway area flowing onto the highway roadbed.
(6)
The driveway shall not obstruct or impair drainage in side ditches or roadside areas. Driveway culverts, where necessary, shall be adequate for surface water drainage along the roadway and in no case less than equivalent of 15-inch diameter pipe. The distance between culverts under successive driveways shall be not less than ten feet except as such restricted area is permitted to be filled in under the provisions of subsection (a)(8) of this section.
(7)
When curb and gutter are removed for constructing a driveway, the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway surface shall connect with the highway pavement and the sidewalk, if any, in a neat workmanlike manner. The driveway construction shall include replacement by reason of vehicular travel across the sidewalk.
(8)
The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in or graded down only when the following requirements are fully complied with:
a.
The filling or grading down shall be to grades approved by the zoning administrator; and except where drainage is by means of curb and gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the highway roadbed in a suitable manner.
b.
Culvert extension under the restricted area shall be of like size and equivalent acceptable material of the driveway culvert, and intermediate manholes adequate for clean-out purposes may be required where the total culvert length exceeds 100 feet.
c.
Where no side ditch separates the restricted area from the roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate the area from the highway roadbed to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by construction of a boarder, curb, rail, or posts deemed adequate by the zoning administrator.
(b)
General design standards. The location, design, and construction of the driveway shall be in accordance with the following standards. Additional access improvements such as, but not limited to, deceleration lanes, dedicated left-turning lanes, center turn lanes, merge lanes, and signalization may be required for safe traffic operations, if deemed necessary by the city engineer.
(1)
A driveway shall be located and restricted as to width as necessary so that the entire driveway and its appurtenances are contained within the frontage along the highway of the property served. At public highway intersections a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from the public highway intersection area and shall not encroach on or occupy areas of the roadway or right-of-way deemed necessary for effective traffic control or for highway signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the highway.
(2)
The number of driveways permitted serving a single property frontage shall be a maximum of two unless more are deemed necessary by the zoning administrator for reasonable service to the property without undue impairment of safety, convenience, and utility of the highway.
(3)
If the property has frontage on more than one street, and a driveway permit is requested, and if it is determined that the construction of such a driveway on the major street would cause a nuisance to the surrounding area, a traffic hazard, or unduly congest traffic, then the permit may be denied.
(c)
Specific design standards. The following specific design standards shall apply to driveways requiring permits as set forth in these regulations:
(1)
Driveway widths.
EXPAND
Minimum
(in feet) Maximum
(in feet)
Residential 8 15
Residential-duplex 8 22
Apartments 10 30
Commercial 15 25 (one-way)
20 30 (two-way)
Industrial 20 40
  (2)
Driveway angle.
EXPAND
Minimum (in degrees)
Residential 60—90 or parallel to property line
Apartments 70—90 for two-way driveways
45—90 for one-way driveways
Commercial 70—90 two-way driveways
45—90 one-way on divided roadway
60—90 one-way ramp, nondivided roadway

(in feet)
Residential 3.5 15
Apartment 5 20
Commercial-urban 10 20
Commercial-suburban 15 25

Industrial-urban 15 25
Industrial-rural 25 40
  (4)
Percent of property frontage available for driveways and approaches. Each single driveway shall have a maximum width of 30 percent of the property frontage. Where two or more driveways are permitted, no more than 60 percent of property frontage shall be used as driveways. No approval for a curb cut will be given where it is apparent that the intent is not to provide access but to provide parking only. A driveway approach must provide access to something definite on private property such as parking area considerably greater in extent than the width of the driveway, or provide access to a driveway, or to a door at least eight feet wide intended for the entrance of vehicles, etc. (Not applicable for residential driveways.)
(5)
Minimum distance to side property lines. The more restrictive of subsection (5)a or (5)b of this section shall apply.
a.
The area along a side property line within five feet of a frontage boundary line shall be a restricted area on which no driveway may be developed on public right-of-way.
b.
A minimum of five feet between the side property line and the pavement edge or curb shall be left undisturbed or landscaped adjacent to each frontage boundary lien to serve as an island area. This distance shall be measured between the frontage boundary tangency of the driveway radius and edge of pavement measured along edge of pavement. This distance shall be increased to 25 feet where the subject lot abuts a residential district.
These requirements may be waived when a single driveway is approved to serve two adjacent lots: (See also section 54-216.)
(6)
Island areas (channelization).
a.
Minimum island dimensions.
1.
Distance between double driveways: ten feet minimum at narrowest point.
2.
Minimum island depth: ten feet where parking lot abuts street right-of-way line.
b.
Treatment of island of buffer area. In the development of private property and the construction of driveways thereto, it may be necessary to regrade the buffer area by cutting or filling. Such work shall be done in a manner to ensure adequate sight distance for traffic operations, proper drainage, suitable slopes for maintenance operations, and good appearance. The buffer area outside the driveway shall be designed to ensure no access by vehicles. This may be accomplished by the grading, use of curbs, rails, guide post, low walls, low shrubs, etc., in a manner which will not impair clear sight across the area.
c.
Visibility clearance. No landscaping, fences, terraces, or other natural or artificial features adjacent to any street shall be of a nature impairing visibility from or of approaching vehicular traffic where such visibility is important to safety, nor shall such features in any way create potential hazards to pedestrians. In particular, at vehicular entrances and exits, no off street parking, landscaping, or other material impediment to visibility between the height of 2.5 feet and 12 feet measured from the roadway level, shall be permitted within triangular areas defined by lines connecting points described as follows:
1.
Nonresidential use. Beginning at a point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of 35 feet along the right-of-way in the direction of approaching traffic, thence to a point of 25 feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to a point of beginning.
2.
Multifamily residential use. Beginning at a point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of ten feet along the right-of-way in the direction approaching traffic, thence to a point of ten feet toward the interior of the lot along the mid-line of the entrance or exit, and thence to point of beginning. (See also section 54-82.)
(7)
Intersection clearance (corner island channelization). The length, width and shape of corner island areas will vary for different locations. The angle of intersections, angle of driveways, width of the right-of-way on both approaches, channelization radii, and other conditions will influence the location of driveways at intersections. The location and angle of an approach in relation to the highway intersection shall be such that a vehicle leaving the service facility may be merged in a lane of traffic moving in the desired direction before crossing the intersection; and that a vehicle entering the facility from the intersection may do so in an orderly and safe manner with a minimum of interference to through traffic. The following conditions shall be applicable in most instances:
a.
No driveway shall be allowed to encroach upon pavement edge radii.
b.
The following minimum distances from the intersection right-of-way line shall apply where there is no conflict with the foregoing conditions:
1.
Traffic volume Average Daily Traffic (ADT) of 1,500 or less: 20 feet.
2.
Traffic volume ADT over 1,500 but less than 10,000: 35 feet.
3.
Traffic volume ADT over 10,000 but less than 15,000: 50 feet.
4.
Traffic volume ADT over 15,000: 65 feet.
The zoning administrator shall have the authority to increase these distances if in his opinion such action is necessary to ensure proper circulation of traffic. The zoning administrator may also modify these requirements if justifiable on the basis of site conditions.
(8)
Parking and storage areas. Each establishment required by the zoning regulations in chapter 54 to have off-street parking, when providing off-street parking or storage space, shall provide such parking or storage space off the right-of-way to prevent the storage of vehicles on the driveway or the backing up of traffic on the travel way. Particular attention will be paid to "drive-in facilities" such as banks, car washes, drive-through restaurants, drive-in bill paying facilities, and other service facilities where motorists are served while in their vehicles, to ensure that queues of vehicles will not extend out onto the public streets.
(9)
Driveway grade.
a.
Residential driveways. The maximum grade which shall be permitted is 17 percent.
b.
Apartments, commercial and industrial driveways. The maximum grade which shall be permitted is eight percent.
c.
Grades within the right-of-way shall be controlled by existing shoulder slope or existing and future sidewalk elevations.
d.
When driveways are intended for special use vehicles, the underside clearance and/or break-over angle of the subject vehicle shall dictate the maximum driveway grade.
(d)
General conditions of approval. The following conditions shall apply to all approvals for driveway construction on public right-of-way.
(1)
The applicant shall represent all parties with a property interest in the proposed driveway and shall certify that any driveway or approach constructed by him is for the bonafide purpose of securing access to his property and not for the purpose of parking or servicing vehicles, or for advertising, storage, or merchandising of goods on the city right-of-way.
(2)
The applicant shall furnish all materials, do all work, and pay all costs in connection with the construction and maintenance of the driveway and its appurtenances on the right-of-way unless the city council agrees otherwise. The applicant shall arrange for and bear the entire cost of moving poles, trees, signs, hydrants, catchbasins, and other existing installations which may interfere with the proposed driveway. Materials used and type and character of work shall be suitable and appropriate for its intended purpose, and the type of construction shall be as designated and subject to approval of the zoning administrator. The timetable for installation shall be approved by the zoning administrator. The applicant shall make the installation without jeopardy to or interference with vehicular traffic using the highway or pedestrian traffic using the adjacent sidewalk. Street surfaces, shoulders, ditches, and vegetation disturbed shall be restored to equivalent or original condition by the applicant.
(3)
No revisions or additions shall be made to the driveway or its appurtenances on the right-of-way without the written permission of the zoning administrator.
(4)
The city reserves the right to make such changes, additions, repairs and relocations within statutory limits to the driveway or its appurtenances on the right-of-way as may at any time be considered necessary to permit the relocation, reconstruction, widening, and maintaining of the highway or to provide proper protection to life and property on or adjacent to the street. The city shall make all reasonable attempts to comply with all provisions of this chapter.
(5)
The applicant, his successors or assignees, agree to hold harmless the city and its duly appointed agents and employees against any action for personal injury or property damage sustained by reasons of the exercise of the permit issued pursuant to these regulations.
(6)
Whenever an existing road is improved by reconstruction or maintenance work, existing entrances to the road may be altered by the city to conform to the spirit and intent of the policy and standards set forth in these regulations.
(7)
Whenever the zoning administrator determines that inadequate or indiscriminate access or long stretches of paved or unpaved accesses result in an undue hazard to the motoring public on the thoroughfare, existing entrances may be required to be altered or reduced in extent to conform with the spirit and intent of this policy and upon approval of the city council.
