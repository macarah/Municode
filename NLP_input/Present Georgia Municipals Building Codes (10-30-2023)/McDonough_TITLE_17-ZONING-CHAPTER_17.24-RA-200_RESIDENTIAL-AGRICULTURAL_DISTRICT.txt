3.

The definition of livestock shall not include horses for purposes of this Title.
4.
Boarding, keeping or raising of horses for non-commercial purposes, provided that no structure, pen, or corral housing horses shall be closer than two hundred (200) feet to any property line and that horses, if any, shall be kept at numbers not exceeding two (2) horses per five (5) acres.
