Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

(a)
When the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within seven days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b)
A written notice of violation may, at the discretion of the city manager, require the user to provide an engineering report from an independent engineer registered/licensed in the state. The engineering report shall contain the engineer's opinion as to the cause of the violation as well as what actions are required of the user to prevent the violation from reoccurring in the future.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.28. - Consent orders.
The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 45-48.30 and 45-48.31 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)

If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.31. - Cease and desist orders.
When the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)

(a)
When the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(b)
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half percent per month. A lien against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(c)
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city council may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(d)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.33. - Emergency suspensions.
The city may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 45-48.34 of this article are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 45-48.29 or 45-48.34 of this article.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.34. - Termination of discharge.

DIVISION 11. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS

Sec. 45-49.42. - Upset.
(a)
For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(b)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c), below, are met.
(c)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1)
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2)
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
(3)
The user has submitted the following information to the city manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
a.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
b.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
c.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(d)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(e)
Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(f)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.43. - Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 45-27(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in subsection 45-27(b) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.44. - Bypass.
(a)
For the purposes of this section:
(1)
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2)
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)
Bypass notifications.
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city manager may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(d)
Bypass.
(1)
Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section.
(2)
The city manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

DIVISION 12. - WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES

Sec. 45-49.45. - Establishment of high strength wastewater.
All persons discharging non-domestic wastewater into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following normal concentrations:
(1)
A five-day, 20-degree Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 250 mg/l, or, suspended solids content of 250 mg/l, as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater (except for certain low flow, non-domestic dischargers, see subsection 45-49.46(e), below).
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.46. - Fees for high strength wastewater.
(a)
Surcharges imposed for certain non-domestic wastewater. Non-domestic wastewater dischargers may be imposed surcharges, at the sole discretion of the city, for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and/or total suspended solids (TSS) that exceeds 250 mg/l. The amount of such surcharge, which is charged and assessed against all persons discharging non-domestic wastewater into the public sewers, shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess TSS. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of the following:
(1)
Fixed charges for maintenance and operation of the sewerage system to include sewer, plants, pumping stations and other necessary appurtenances including depreciation and other incidental expense.
(2)
Formula determining surcharge. When either or both the total suspended solids and BOD of water or waste accepted for admission to the city sewerage works exceeds the values of these constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or both, as the case may be, shall be evaluated in terms of normal sewerage and be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula:
Amount of surcharge = (A-B) x Q x 8.34 x C x D
Where: "A" = The actual BOD or TSS (average for month) mg/l
"B" = 250 mg/l.
"C" = The cost per pound of BOD or TSS above the established maximum of 250 mg/l.
"D" = The days of the month.
"Q" = The average daily flow MGD.
(b)
The rates of surcharge for each of the aforementioned constituents at present shall be as follows:
(1)
For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)—$0.25/lb.
(2)
For total suspended solids—$0.25/lb.
(c)
For those situations in which BOD or TSS are in excess of 350 mg/l, a surcharge will not be levied, and the BOD and TSS levels exceeding 350 mg/l will be a violation which will be punished as a misdemeanor, and violators will be charged up to a maximum $1,000.00 per violation.
(d)
The rates of surcharge shall be reviewed annually by the city, at the sole discretion of the city, in order that the above factors may correctly represent current treatment costs. If changes are deemed advisable, they may be made effective January 1 of each year, when approved by the mayor and city council.
(e)
Any sample collected by the city, or reported by the non-domestic user, that exceeds 350 mg/l of BOD or TSS will be considered to be a violation of the city ordinances subject to a fine of $1,000.00 per violation. The non-domestic user will be notified of all such violations by a written notice of violation (NOV). The $1,000.00 fine will be imposed on the non-domestic user's subsequent water and sewer bill following the issuance of the NOV. Any non-domestic user who receives three or more NOVs in a given month will be subject to the termination of sewer service.
(f)
Mass limits. It is acknowledged by the city that non-domestic wastewater dischargers whose flows are low will not adversely impact the city's sewer system. In that regard, there will be no BOD or TSS violations imposed for non-domestic users whose flows are less than 25,000 gpd, and whose mass loadings for BOD and TSS are less than 73 pounds per day.
(Ord. No. 2022-0008, § 1(Exh. A), 12-8-2022)
Sec. 45-49.47. - Quantitative measurement of surcharge parameters.
Surcharges will be based on composite wastewater samples collected by the city from time-to-time taken of the non-domestic user's wastewater discharge. The surcharge for a particular sample that exceeds 250 mg/l will remain in effect for the entire subsequent month following the month in which the sample was taken. If the city collects multiple samples in a given month, then the sample results for that month will be averaged for the surcharge applicability and/or amount. The calculated surcharge amount will be added to the non-domestic user's water and sewer bill for the applicable months. For any months for which no samples are collected, the most immediate past sample or samples will remain in effect.

Sec. 45-49.48. - Determination of wastewater volume.
Unless otherwise provided, the volume of wastewater delivered to the POTW will be based upon the quantity of water purchased from and metered by the city. If the volume of water delivered to the POTW is greater or less than the volume purchased from the city, the user shall make known to the city such differences. If differences do exist, it shall be the obligation of the user to install city approved meters or other devices to determine the portion or quantity of wastewater delivered to the POTW at locations readily accessible for meter reading by the city. Separate water meters installed in the city right-of-way are preferred for measuring non-sewered consumptive water usage. The city may consider establishing a constant ratio, factor, or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the water industry. Determining, as well as justifying, the factor to the city will be the responsibility of the user. The value of this factor may be periodically reviewed for accuracy by the city. Other methods may be established by the city to estimate the quantity of wastewater released to the sanitary sewer which considers the amount of water consumed during different seasons. Users that claim wastewater volumes to be inaccurately determined by these methods shall bear the expense of installing city approved meters to estimate flows to the POTW more accurately.
