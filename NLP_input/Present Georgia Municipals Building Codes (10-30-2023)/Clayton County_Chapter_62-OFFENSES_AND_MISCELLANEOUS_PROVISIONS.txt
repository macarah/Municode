Sec. 62-3.1. - Policy and purpose.
It is declared to be the public policy and purpose of the county board of commissioners to utilize its police powers to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of this county. The board of commissioners recognizes that its citizens derive numerous economic and personal benefits from the use of devises that emit noises. There are, nonetheless, measurable damages and injuries to the environment and to the public health which may be directly attributable to loud, unnecessary, or unusually disturbing sound or noise which has a detrimental effect on the health and welfare of the citizenry and an individual's right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment. Accordingly, the board of commissioners finds that this Code section is necessary for the immediate preservation of the peace, health, safety, welfare, and prosperity of the citizens of Clayton County. However, nothing in this Code section is intended to deter individuals from lawfully exercising the individual right to freedom of speech or any other freedom guaranteed under the Constitutions of the United States of America or of the State of Georgia.

At numerous community meetings many citizens have voiced their concerns about the increase in child violence, the need to protect our children from being victims of crimes that occur after the hour set out in this section for curfew, and the need to make parents more responsible for their children.
In an effort to keep the county drug free and the county's streets safe by reducing the numbers of crimes that are committed by and against children after the hour set out in this section for curfew, the board of commissioners finds that a child curfew ordinance is one initiative to protect children in Clayton County from being the victims, as well as perpetrators, of crime.
Accordingly, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to reduce the number of crimes committed by and against children, and to safeguard the welfare of our children in areas in unincorporated Clayton County after the hour set out in this section for curfew; it, therefor, enacts a child curfew ordinance as hereinafter set forth in the best interest of the citizens of Clayton County.

a.
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
b.
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this Code section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.G.C.A. chapter 39A of title 43, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.
c.
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the designated officer or agent may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
d.
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials;
e.
That the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(3)
The lien provided for in paragraph e. of subsection (2) of this Code section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (g) of O.G.C.A. § 41-2-12. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.G.C.A. chapter 4 of title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of O.G.C.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county whose ordinance is being enforced. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(4)
The board of commissioners of the county may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(5)
Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.G.C.A. § 5-3-29.
(6)
In addition to the procedures and remedies in this section, the board of commissioners of the county may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section.
(7)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the county to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
(g)

Scrap tire generator enforcement.
a.
Scrap tire generators shall have the necessary licenses and specifications as required by Georgia state law.

These records shall be maintained on file at the facility in question for three years and shall be made available for inspection by the Clayton County Police/Code Enforcement during normal business hours.

However, if a scrap tire generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are used tires, retreadable casings or scrap tires, then all tires transported shall be considered scrap tires and must be thusly indicated on the shipment manifest. It is a rebuttable presumption that non-new tires are scrap tires.
