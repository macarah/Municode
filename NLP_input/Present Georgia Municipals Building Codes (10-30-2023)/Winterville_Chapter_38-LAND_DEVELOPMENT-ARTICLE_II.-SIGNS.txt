ARTICLE II. - SIGNS

Sec. 38-19. - Objectives and purposes.
(a)
The objective of this article is to establish requirements for the placement, installation and maintenance of signs in order to preserve and protect the health, safety, welfare, and general well-being of the community's citizens. As the regulations of the placement, construction and maintenance of buildings and structures through zoning is a valid use of the police power, so, too, is the regulation of the placement, installation and maintenance of signs, since such signs in the literal sense must ordinarily be considered structures, and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as are produced by buildings. The regulation of the placement, installation and maintenance of signs is further justified by the signs' innate scheme and primary purpose to draw mental attention to its content, potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and the safety of the motoring public to whom a majority of the signs are oriented. Therefore, it is the intent of this article to regulate the size and location of signs such that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions. However, it is not the intent of this article that all signs are built to the maximum size. The city encourages use of the minimum signage necessary to meet the purposes required.
(b)
Further, recognizing that the aesthetic, cultural and historic qualities of the city are unique and, therefore, vital to the community's interest, it is the objective of this article to ensure compatibility to the aforementioned themes and to ensure that these qualities are not compromised.
(c)
Further, it is an objective of this article to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the number, size, placement, installation and maintenance of signs. The fact that such signs are intended to command visual contact grants to signs a proportionately greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community.
(d)
The aesthetic impact of signs is an economic fact that can bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property; therefore, the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the community. It is contended that it is not irrational for a community's citizens to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized.
(e)
It is the belief of the city that more communication is desirable during the election cycle, so that all citizens may freely express their viewpoints during the election campaigns, and, therefore, this article allows increased opportunities to erect signs during these periods, without limiting content or favoring content in any fashion.
(f)
In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the city has determined the following: large signs are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the state supreme court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and the eleventh circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that this article is within the law and constitutional, which is a goal of the city. The goal of this article is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner regulation.
(g)
In addition, it is declared that the regulation of signs within the city is necessary and in the public interest for the following reasons:
(1)
To protect property values within the city.
(2)
To protect the motoring public from damage or injury caused or partially attributable to distractions or obstructions from improperly designed or situated signs.
(3)
To promote the economic well-being of the city by creating a favorable image.
(4)
To eliminate the clutter of excess signage.
(5)
To protect the right of citizens to enjoy the city's natural scenic beauty.
(6)
To protect and enhance the unique aesthetic, cultural and historic attractions to tourists and thereby promote and stimulate business.
(7)
To regulate the construction, erection, maintenance and size of signs that may constitute a direct danger to pedestrians and property, especially during periods of high winds.
(8)
To promote the aesthetic beauty of the environment of the city.
(9)
To ensure reasonable opportunities for communication for all groups and interests.
(10)
To preserve and promote the public health, safety and welfare in the city.

Sec. 38-30. - Variances.
(a)
Application of variance requirements. The mayor and council are hereby empowered to vary or adapt the strict application of the requirements of this article. It is the intent of this article that the variance be used only to overcome some exceptional physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty and prevents the owner from obtaining the full use and purpose of the sign as intended by this article. Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the sign. No variance in the strict application of the provisions of this article shall be granted by the mayor and council unless it finds that the requirements and standards detailed in this article are satisfied.
(b)
Standards for granting variance. A variance may only be granted if the mayor and council find that all of the following conditions exist:
(1)
By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape; or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions; or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property, the strict application of the regulations would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner of such property;
(2)
The hardship or problem was not created by the property owner or a predecessor property owner, such as an illegal lot split creating a substandard lot, or other self-imposed hardship;
(3)
The variance can be granted without impairing the purposes of this article and without infringing on the rights of neighboring property owners or impairing the public health, safety and welfare.
(c)
Conditions. In granting a variance, the mayor and council may impose conditions on the variance that they deem necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.
(d)
Regulations that may be varied. A variance may only be granted as to the following regulations:
(1)
Sign setback;
(2)
Sign height;
(3)
Sign placement; and/or
(4)
Sign type.
(e)
Regulations that may not be varied. The following regulations enacted in this article are not subject to variance:
(1)
Maximum allowable square footage of sign area;
(2)
Total number of signs allowed;
(3)
Maximum allowable total sign square footage allowed per site; and
(4)
Regulations that protect public safety.
(f)
Variance after denials. If a sign permit is denied by the planning and zoning commission based on a regulation that can be varied, as an alternative to an appeal, a property owner or sign contractor may apply to the mayor and council for a variance by filing an application with the city clerk.
