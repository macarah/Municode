ARTICLE 14. - SIGNS[5]

Footnotes:
--- (5) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 11-2012, adopted November 26, 2012, amended article 14 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article 14, §§ 14.1—14.10, pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

Sec. 14.1. - Purpose and Findings.
The Mayor and Council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the City's overall public welfare and economic growth as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards & Sign Control available at http://www.scenic.org.
By enacting this ordinance, the Mayor and Council intend to:
a.
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
b.
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
c.
Improve traffic and pedestrian safety;
d.
Maintain and enhance the visual image of the City;
e.
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
f.
To promote the purposes stated in this section by regulating signs based on objective standards, including, but not limited to height and size, and without regard to the content of the sign message;
g.
Promote economic development; and
h.
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
14.1-1
The City also finds the following.
a.
There is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The City finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
b.
Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

In the event any section, subsection, sentence, or word of this ordinance is declared and adjudged to be invalidated or unconstitutional, such declaration or adjudication shall not affect the remaining portions of this article, which shall remain in full force and effect as if such portion so declared or adjudged unconstitutional were not originally part of this article. The City Council declares that it would have enacted the remaining parts of this article if it had known that such portion thereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.
