(a)
The original recorded plat shall be used for all revisions.
(b)
When it becomes necessary to revise an original recorded final plat due to some error, required adjustment or desired adjustment, the applicant shall confer with the planning director to determine if the revision is a minor or major revision. The applicant's surveyor shall make the necessary corrections on the original final plat or prepare a new tracing of that portion of the subdivision involved.

(d)
If the planning director determines the change is minor, then the planning director will obtain the chief executive officer's acknowledgement, approval, and acceptance of the revised final plat, and shall file such revised plat with the clerk of superior court.
