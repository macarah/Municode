Chapter 4 - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

4.1 - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide site design and development standards applicable to both public and private development within the City of Stockbridge. More specifically, the purposes of the regulations set forth in this chapter are to ensure the proper location, height, bulk and size of buildings and other structures; to ensure the proper size of yards and other features of a development site; to ensure the proper layout and design of subdivisions; and to provide for compatibility between proposed and existing development.
4.2 - Expansion or modification of existing uses and structures.
No structure, parking area, or other site feature regulated by this Code shall be enlarged, altered, or expanded unless the minimum improvements required by this article are provided to the property to the extent of its alteration or expansion. In the case of a substantial expansion, the portion of the site affected must meet the requirements of this chapter.
An alteration or expansion to an existing property is substantial when the area or square footage of the expanded or altered land (including property used for building space, parking, or storage) or structure, respectively, exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the area or square footage of the existing land or structure, exclusive of the alteration or expansion.

Calculate the parking requirement for each proposed use, as set forth below.
b.
Multiply each amount by the corresponding percentages from the table below for each of the five (5) time periods.
