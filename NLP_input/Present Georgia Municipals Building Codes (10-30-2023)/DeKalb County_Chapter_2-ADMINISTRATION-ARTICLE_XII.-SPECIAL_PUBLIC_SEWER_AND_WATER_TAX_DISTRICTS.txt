ARTICLE XII. - SPECIAL PUBLIC SEWER AND WATER TAX DISTRICTS

Sec. 2-700. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
Article IX, section II, paragraph VI of the Georgia Constitution gives the governing authority the power to create special districts for the provision of local government services within such districts, and to levy and collect taxes within such districts to pay for the cost of providing such services.
(b)
The county's public sewer, as that term is defined in section 25-145, now and as it may be amended hereafter, collects, treats, transports, and disposes of sewage, which is water-carried waste including human excrement and grey water, from residences, businesses, buildings and institutions.
(c)
The county's public water system, as that term is defined in section 25-26, now and as it may be amended hereafter, collects, pumps, and distributes treated potable water to residences, businesses, buildings and institutions.
(d)
When blockages and overflows occur, untreated sewage may spill over into the county's waterways, which adversely affects the county's water quality and jeopardizes the health and welfare of county citizens.
(e)
When water main leaks and breaks occur, the county's public water system may experience contamination, reduced pressure and wastage, which adversely affects water quality and jeopardizes the health and welfare of county citizens.
(f)
The governing authority finds that costs associated with sewer seepages, blockages and overflows, and water contamination, lower water pressure and water wastage can be burdensome and, thus, it is in the best interests of all residents of the county to assist in the repair and upgrade of the county's public sewer and water system.
(g)
This article establishes a process to improve, regulate, maintain and operate the county's public sewer and water system in special sewer or water tax districts (hereinafter referred to as "public sewer or water tax districts") comprised of defined areas of the unincorporated county served by the county sewer or water system.
(h)
After the sewer and water improvements are completed, and the cost of the repair and upgrade is fully paid by the collection of taxes within the public sewer or water tax district, then the public sewer or water tax district shall be dissolved by operation of law.
(i)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to require the governing authority to approve any request to establish a public sewer or water tax district, and it shall be in the sole legislative judgment of the governing authority to approve the establishment of any such public sewer or water tax district.
(j)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the governing authority from creating a public sewer or water tax district if it determines that the public sewer or water tax district is required to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county, and it shall be in the sole legislative judgment of the governing authority to make a determination to establish any such public sewer or water tax district.
(k)
This article shall not be used to create a public sewer or water tax district to repair individual sewer and water service lines or laterals that run from a public or private sewer and water main to a structure, as such sewer and water service lines or laterals are regulated in chapter 25 of this Code. Repair, upgrade, and replacement of such sewer and water service lines or laterals remain the responsibility of the owner of the structure.
(l)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to provide a mechanism to create sewer and water tax districts to service property that houses apartments, or to service a commercial, business, industrial, or office structure, enterprise or development.

Sec. 2-705. - Calculation of taxes to be assessed in the public sewer or water tax district.
(a)
The property owners in the public sewer or water tax district collectively shall pay fifty (50) percent of the costs incurred within a public sewer and water tax district, but in no event shall each property owner's share of costs exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00). The county shall pay fifty (50) percent of the same costs, or a greater amount if necessary to enforce the seven thousand five hundred dollar ($7,500.00) cap. Each property owner in the public sewer and water tax district shall be responsible for and pay his/her pro rata share of the costs, which shall be divided equally among all property owners within such district on the basis of the number of lots, whether improved or unimproved, or on the basis of the number of condominium units, as that term is defined by state law. Owners of exempt properties shall not be included in the calculation of costs.
(b)
Each year, the finance director shall be responsible for calculating each property owner's annual pro rata share of the costs, in accordance with the provisions of this article. The tax commissioner shall be responsible for collecting from the property owners payment of their pro rata share of the fifty (50) percent of costs incurred within a public sewer and water tax district. The finance director and tax commissioner shall be notified by the executive assistant at such time as the public sewer and water tax district is approved to commence the collection and receipt of monies in payment of estimated assessment rates. Beginning January 1 of the year following the creation of the tax district and for each year thereafter, the tax statement issued to each such property owner shall include a separate line item tax showing each property owner's annual pro rata share of the costs until paid. When all work within an approved public sewer and water tax district is complete, the finance director and tax commissioner shall adjust estimated assessment rates pursuant to subsection (c) to reflect all costs incurred within a public sewer and water tax district.
(c)
The fifty (50) percent of costs, as limited by the seven thousand five hundred dollar ($7,500.00) cap, shall be the special services public sewer and water tax and shall become due and payable at the same time that other county taxes are due and payable. If such tax remains unpaid, the tax commissioner shall have the authority to issue a writ of fieri facias or execution against the property served, which writ shall have the same lien dignity and priority as writs of fieri facias or executions issued for other county taxes. Each annual special services public sewer and water tax shall become a lien against the property served on January 1 of each year in the same manner that a lien attaches for other county taxes, and such lien shall cover the property of the owner until such special services public sewer and water tax is paid. Any unpaid amount shall accrue penalty, interest and charges in the same manner and at the same rate as other delinquent county taxes.
( Ord. No. 13-10 , Pt. I, 5-28-13)

On December 31 of the tenth year following creation of a public sewer and water tax district, the public sewer and water tax district shall stand dissolved by operation of law.
