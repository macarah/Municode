ARTICLE II. - JUVENILE CURFEW

It is the responsibility of the city council to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. The city council is concerned about the increase in criminal activity engaged in by minors, especially those crimes that occur after hours and/or at times in which juveniles should be at home. During public hearings held in the city, many citizens voiced their concerns about the increase in youth vandalism and violence, the need to protect children and adults from being victims of crimes that occur after hours, and the need to make parents more responsible for their children. A child curfew ordinance is one initiative in protecting our children from being the victims and perpetrators of crime. In an effort to keep our communities drug-free and our streets safe by reducing the numbers of crimes that are committed by and against minors after hours, the city council believes that a child curfew ordinance is in the best interest of the citizens of the city. Accordingly, the city finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to reduce the number of crimes committed by and against juveniles after hours, and to safeguard the welfare of our citizens.
