Footnotes:
--- (11) ---
Editor's note— An ordinance of December 2, 2008, amended the Code by repealing former art. XIX, §§ 6-310—6-325, and adding a new art. XIX. Former art. XIX pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from an ordinance of June 20, 1995.

Sec. 6-310. - Purpose and intent.
The county has been richly blessed with the heritage and history of its people who are now deceased, and many of these people, in their time, were native pioneers of the county who have played an integral part in making this county what it is today; many of those who passed on have been memorialized with resting places in cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds that have been abandoned, desecrated, neglected, unmarked, and are threatened by unknowing development; such abandoned, desecrated, neglected, and unmarked cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds are not a befitting tribute to such honorable citizens of the past.
Therefore, it is the desire of the county board of commissioners to provide for the preservation, protection, and maintenance of all such family/community cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds.
The board of commissioners hereby declares it to be the purpose and intent of this article to establish a commission for the purpose of providing a uniform procedure for the identification, preservation, protection, and maintenance of cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds, in accordance with the provisions of this article.

Sec. 6-312. - Creation.
(a)
Creation of the Douglas County Cemetery Preservation Commission (DCCPC), members, number, appointment, terms. The title of the commission shall be the "Douglas County Cemetery Preservation Commission" (DCCPC). The DCCPC shall consist of ten (10) members appointed by the board of commissioners, who shall be residents of the county who have demonstrated special interest in the identification, preservation, and maintenance of the county cemeteries and graveyards. The DCCPC may appoint an eleventh ex officio non-voting member who shall be an archeologist or other person with expertise in cemetery issues. Such ex officio member is not required to be a resident of the county. Each member of the board of commissioners shall be entitled to appoint two (2) members to the commission. The term of each member shall run concurrently with and at the pleasure of the appointing commissioner's term of office and until a successor is appointed and qualified. If an appointing commissioner is no longer in office due to a general election or a special election in which more than one (1) year remains in the commissioner's term, any member appointed by such commissioner shall be subject to removal with or without cause and without regard to any un-expired term by the newly elected commissioner filling such seat.

c.
Determine status and needs of each cemetery and prioritize its need for essential maintenance to be performed. Such maintenance shall be designed to prevent the deterioration or loss of the burial ground and/or any burial objects it may contain. The intent of maintenance is to prevent a burial ground from being lost, becoming an eyesore, or a public nuisance that would invite vandalism or other illegal activities. Such maintenance shall not compel repair or restoration by the county of any extant burial objects such as grave markers or the burial ground generally.
d.
Establish and publish guidelines regarding cemetery preservation, maintenance, landscaping, security, development and other information.
e.
Work with the development services department.

a.
Should be acquired by the county pursuant to O.C.G.A. 36-72-3.
b.
Should be preserved and protected by the county.
Such recommendations should include a plan that provides regular maintenance such as removal of encroaching underbrush, leaves and leaf litter, storm debris, deadfall, and trash resulting from littering.
(4)

(1)
A twenty-five-foot natural undisturbed buffer around the perimeter of the outermost burials;

(1)
To preserve and protect such cemetery or burial ground, regardless of the financial ability of those legally responsible. The board of commissioners may then seek reimbursement from the person legally responsible for the upkeep of such cemetery or burial ground. If the responsible party fails to reimburse the county, the board of commissioners may collect the amount owed by levying upon any property of the responsible person.
