Section 7. - Purpose and intent of zoning districts.
The following sections specify the purpose and intent of the zoning districts established by this ordinance. Uses specified in this section are examples only. Specific uses allowed in each district are defined in section 9.
EXPAND
A-1 General agricultural and forestry district. The agricultural/forestry district is established to maintain those areas with land characteristics, such as soil moisture, temperature and content suitable for farming, forestry operations and other agricultural uses from encroachment by untimely and unplanned residential, commercial or industrial development; to permit the continuation of agricultural uses in areas where development is anticipated, but where the present application of zoning controls for future, more intensive uses would be unreasonable and premature; to prevent the subdivision of land for residential development that requires public services such as paved roads, water and sanitary sewer; and to preserve the rural, open space character of certain areas. Certain agricultural uses are referred to as a conditional use and are subject to approval by the planning commission.
No new A-1 Agricultural and forestry district may be created which contains less than 25 acres.
R-1 Residential district. The residential district is established to preserve land areas for single dwelling unit structures and to promote residential areas with low densities. These areas are intended to be geographically defined and protected from the encroachment of uses not performing a function necessary to a residential environment. Certain nonresidential uses which are more compatible with residential uses may be permitted on review by the planning commission. Public water is required.
C-1 Commercial district. The commercial district is established to provide suitable areas for a broad range of retail, wholesale and service uses. General compatibility with abutting different uses is required, this may be achieved through buffering, screening and/or development plan review. Development in these districts should be located on major thoroughfares, arterial streets or collector streets and the associated street network. The location and development of these commercial activities shall be encouraged so as to minimize traffic hazards and interference with adjacent uses.
I-1 Industrial district. The industrial district is established to provide areas for the development of industrial and assembly plants and their related activities. It is also the intent of this district that noise, odor, dust and glare associated with uses permitted in this district be confined as much as possible. It is also the intent of this district that traffic generated by uses permitted including raw materials, finished products and employees, be minimal but that transportation facilities and routes be easily accessible. Development in these districts should be served by sanitary sewer or have provision for on-site disposal.
No new I-1 industrial districts may be created which contains less than ten acres.
CORD Commercial outdoor recreation development district. This district is a floating zone. The CORD district is established to provide areas for commercial recreational facilities and activities. This does not include seasonal hunting rights between consenting parties. CORDS may be located in any district subject to approval by the Talbot County Board of Commissioners.
MHU-1 Manufactured housing unit district-parks. The manufactured housing unit district-parks is established to provide areas within the county for the placement of manufactured housing units in parks which are designed for the placement of manufactured housing units. The specific intent of this district is: to require adequate space and facilities for healthful living conditions; to require all such districts to have access to a major arterial county road for easy accessibility; to insure suitable water and sewer facilities are provided according to health regulations and statutes of the State of Georgia and the county commission; and to encourage the development of manufacture home parks for long term residential use rather than transient travel trailer use.
PUD Planned unit development district. Planned unit development district is a method of development which permits a tract of land to be developed as one lot, rather than separate lots. The technique is used to encourage coordinated development; to permit higher densities in conjunction with functional open space; to promote efficient use of existing natural landscape features and to be developed in compliance with an approved development plan.
No new PUD districts may be created which contain less than 50 acres.

Detailed regulations for military influence overlay district. Based on the recommendations of the Fort Benning Joint Land Use Study (May, 2008), there is hereby established the military influence overlay district, shown on the Official Zoning Map of Talbot County, which is hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. Development within the military influence overlay district shall comply with the provisions of this ordinance.
The regulations established for this district are intended to limit land uses that are incompatible to the training activities on Fort Benning and to provide for communication, coordination and consultation between the county and Fort Benning on potential noise and prescribed burning events on the military installation and all rezoning and subdivision activities within the Fort Benning Land Use Planning Zone (LUPZ), Noise Zone II (NZ2) and the one mile buffer of Fort Benning.
The regulations prescribed for this district shall not be construed to require the removal of, lowering or changes to any existing building, tower or structure as of the effective date of this ordinance. Further, should any existing tower, building or structure require maintenance or replacement, not to exceed its original height and dimensions, nothing in this act will prevent such maintenance or replacement. No future use of the land and no future construction of any structure shall be allowed which is inconsistent with this ordinance.
8.7.1.
Uses. Uses such as low-density manufacturing, retail, government facilities, and agriculture are deemed compatible.
Noise sensitive uses, such as housing, schools, medical facilities or places of worship; uses that tend to concentrate large numbers of people (certain higher residential densities, schools, churches, hospitals, sports stadiums, shopping malls) are generally deemed incompatible, but may be allowed depending on the level of exposure to excessive noise and accident potential and contingent upon the use of noise level reduction measures in the construction of the building and/or site.
Uses that can interfere with safe air navigation, such as tall structures, or activities that throw off excessive lighting, smoke or dust and may impair vision are deemed incompatible.
8.7.2.
Development standards.
1.
Density. Limit single-family residential density to one—two dwelling units per acre in the LUPZ and one-mile buffer; limit density to one dwelling unit per five acres in the NZII.
2.
Noise. When noise-sensitive structures are either located within or are planned to be located within the LUPZ and the NZII, building standards need to incorporate noise level reduction measures of at least 23 dB and 30 dB to provide a level of sound attenuation compatible with occupancy.
Measures such as building location and site planning, design, the use of forested buffers and of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor noise exposure from ground level transportation sources. These actions are preferred wherever practical to measures that only protect interior spaces.
All re-zonings and subdivision developments require a signed noise easement from the property owner before review by the planning commission.
Buyers and sellers of real property are required at time of contract signing and before settlement to make prospective buyers and renters of real property within the LUPZ and NZII aware of noise routinely generated from Fort Benning testing and training ranges and military aerial training routes.
3.
Lighting. Outdoor lighting systems (streetlights, lighted signage, lighted canopies associated with general retail, or exterior security lighting associated with large buildings) that allow significant light to travel upward into an otherwise darkened sky are allowed contingent upon the use of light pollution reduction measures.
4.
Height. No building or structure shall be erected or built in the LUPZ and NZII that exceeds 150 feet above ground level (AGL).
5.
Interference or Impairment. No use may be made of the land contained in the LUPZ and NZII which will create electrical interference with radio communications between aircraft and the base, confuse or impair visibility or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering in any manner of aircraft using the base and its related gunnery and bombing range.

  Section 10. - Determination of unclassified uses.
In the event an applicant wishes to use property for a use which is not specifically identified under permitted uses or uses permitted subject to the approval of the board of commissioners, and where such use is not specifically prohibited from the district, the following provision shall apply:
1.
The building/zoning official shall submit to the planning commission a written request for determination of the unclassified use.
2.
The planning commission determines that the use is of a similar character and meets the intent of the uses permitted within the district, then they shall instruct the building official to issue a permit.
3.
In the event that the planning commission determines that the proposed use in the district is consistent with the character and intent of permitted uses which are subject to the approval of the board of commissioners, then the applicant shall apply for a conditional use permit subject to approval in the normal manner.
4.
In no event shall the provisions of this section be used to allow an incompatible use or use specifically prohibited by this ordinance within a certain district.
5.
Once the use has been allowed or disallowed by the planning commission, it shall then be considered classified under the appropriated category in the district.
Section 11. - Non-conforming use.
A.
Any structure or use of land existing at the time of the enactment or subsequent amendment of this zoning ordinance, but not in conformity with its use provisions, may be continued with the following limitations:
1.
A non-conforming use may not be changed to another non-conforming use.
2.
A non-conforming use may not be re-established after discontinuance of that use for one year.
3.
A non-conforming use or structure may not be enlarged beyond its size at the time the use or structure become non-conforming. This includes, but is not limited to, the size of the building, the number of employees, operation during other hours of the day or night, the use of additional land, and additional or more powerful equipment.
4.
A non-conforming structure may not be rebuilt, altered, repaired or replaced after incurring damages exceeding 75 percent of the fair market value of the structure at the time immediately preceding such damage occurring. A non-conforming mobile home may not be replaced after it is removed from the property.
B.
The board of commissioners may grant the change, re-establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement of a non-conforming structure upon the following findings:
1.
The change, re-establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement would be no more detrimental to the surrounding area than the existing or previous use;
2.
The structure cannot be economically modified so as to be suitable for uses in the district;
3.
The structure would have to be removed to permit development of the property for conforming uses;
4.
The proposed change, re-establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, replacement or repair would not cause substantial determent to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this zoning ordinance; and,
5.
The requirements of the zoning ordinance for rezoning would prevent the current zoning from being changed to a classification that would allow the proposed change, re-establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement.

This description shall include hours of operation, number of employees, equipment used, products made or sold, type of signs and other information as needed for the board of commissioners to reach a decision.
4.
The applicant shall provide evidence to the board of commissioners on how the proposed change, re-establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement will comply with the current zoning, health and building requirements.
D.
