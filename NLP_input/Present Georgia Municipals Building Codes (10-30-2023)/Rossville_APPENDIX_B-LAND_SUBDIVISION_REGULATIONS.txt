Section 41. - General intent.
It is the intent of these regulations that the planning commission shall represent the city in all negotiations with the subdivider, and shall handle all negotiations between the city and the subdivider for such changes as may be necessary in the subdivision plats. Final approval of all subdivision plats shall be by the planning commission of Rossville.
Section 42. - Notice to subdividers.
It shall be the duty of the secretary of the planning commission to give at least five days notice by registered or certified mail to the subdivision [subdivider] before the date on which the planning commission will review said subdivider's subdivision.
Section 43. - Procedure for conditional approval of preliminary plat.
The subdivider shall prepare a preliminary plat, together with supplementary date as specified in article V, for purposes of conditional approval of preliminary plat.
Three copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary data specified and a filing fee of $1.00 per lot shall be submitted to the city clerk of Rossville, Georgia. The city clerk shall retain one copy and shall forward two copies and a copy of receipt for filing fee to the planning commission.
The planning commission shall, within 15 days, act on the preliminary plat giving consideration to (a) the conformity of the preliminary plat to these regulations, (b) the specific changes that may be required in the preliminary plat, and (c) the kind and extent of improvements to be made. The planning commission shall retain one copy and return one copy of the preliminary plat to the subdivider within the said 15 days, recording the note of conditional approval or disapproval on the plat. If approved, the planning commission shall state the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved the commission shall state reasons therefor. Conditional approval shall be granted only in cases where no changes, or minor changes only, are required in the preliminary plat.
Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, which will be submitted for approval of the planning commission and for recording, upon fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations.
Section 44. - Procedure for approval of final plat.
The subdivider, after notification by the planning commission with respect to the preliminary plat and the changes, if any, to be made therein, shall within six months thereafter file with the planning commission the final plat prepared as specified in article V. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and develop at the time, provided that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
Prior to the approval of the final plat the subdivider shall complete in accordance with the commission's decision, to the satisfaction of the planning commission, all the improvements required by the commission. Alternatively, he shall file with the planning commission a performance bond for the completion of improvements required by the planning commission, prior to the approval of the final plat.
One original and three copies of the final plat; supplementary data, as specified in article V; a filing fee of $1.00 per lot and a recording fee as prescribed by the city shall be submitted to the planning commission within six months after approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise, such approval shall become null and void unless an extension of time is granted by the planning commission.
Within 30 days after the submission of the final plat and supplementary data the planning commission shall afford a hearing to the subdivider sending by registered or certified mail the notice of time and place of hearing not less than five days before the date fixed therefor and shall express and note its final action on the plats and return the original and one copy to the subdivider.
