ARTICLE VIII. - DESIGN STANDARDS

Sec. 34-241. - Scope.
The design standards contained in this article shall apply to all new development and they shall conform to the minimum requirements of the property's zoning designation as required in this chapter.
(Ord. No. 48, ยง 9-1, 1-9-2003)
Sec. 34-242. - Streets.
Streets shall conform to current county road construction and maintenance specifications.
(1)
Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans and maps and with existing amended plans of the planning commission.
(2)
Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended.
(3)
Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround of a 30-foot radius shall be provided. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only.
(4)
Entrances to streets. All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the county's jurisdiction shall be constructed so that:
a.
The vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles travelling in abutting streets;
b.
Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized;
c.
Vehicular access from properties to streets shall not exceed 30 feet in width;
d.
No more than two points of vehicular ingress/egress from a property to each abutting public street shall be permitted for each 400 feet of lot frontage, or fraction thereof; provided, however, that lots with less than 100 feet of frontage shall have no more than one point of ingress/egress to any one public street;
e.
No point of ingress/egress shall be allowed within 35 feet of the right-of-way line of any street intersection;
f.
No curbs on county roads or rights-of-way shall be cut or altered for ingress/egress without approval of the county road department;
g.
An ingress/egress driveway shall be located not closer than 30 feet to another such driveway on the same street.
(5)
Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, regardless of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the director or his designee.
(6)
Local streets. Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through-traffic will be discouraged.
(7)
Trees. It is recommended that as many trees as possible remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and that trees normally remain unless they lie within a planned public right-of-way, within a planned building site or within the necessary paved area surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure.
(8)
Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
a.
In the residential district a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad rights-of-way or limited access highways. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited."
b.
In districts zoned for commercial or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
c.
All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(9)
Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 125 feet shall be prohibited.
(10)
Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable.
(11)
Cul-de-sac. A minor street not to extend more than 1,200 feet in length and provided with a turnaround having a minimum roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, a maximum roadway diameter of 200 feet, and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. Turnarounds having a roadway diameter of 200 feet shall include a landscaped area, a minimum of 100 feet in diameter in the center of the turnaround. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a 30-foot radius. See subsection 34-247(3) for radial lots.
(12)
Alley. Service alleys or drives may be required in multiple dwelling, commercial and industrial developments and shall have a minimum surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys.
(13)
Street right-of-way widths. For street right-of-way widths, reference County Ordinance No. 5. If County Ordinance No. 5 requires more restrictive standards than those standards enumerated in this section, then the provisions of that ordinance shall govern. Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (i) to carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking: (ii) to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and (iii) to serve as an important link in the county's drainage system. In order to fulfill these objectives, minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows:
_____

  1.
When inverted crown is used the minimum grade shall not be less than one-half of one percent.
2.
Except for local streets, roadway widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes are intended only for loading and unloading of passengers and goods and for disabled vehicles and not for the storage of vehicles.
3.
Right-of-way width listed is for only that portion of the typical section between the limits indicated in diagram. Sloping rights of additional right-of-way will be required for cut and fill slopes outside these limits; these future slope areas beyond indicated right-of-way limits should also be kept clear of development until slopes have been constructed.
4.
Right-of-way widths greater than minimum are encouraged because they make for a safer, more aesthetic and more "comfortable" facility and permit future roadway widening without disrupting abutting property.
(14)
Sight distance for vertical curves. Where vertical curves are used, the minimum sight distance shall be as follows:
EXPAND
Design Speed (mph) Minimum Curve Minimum Stopping
Radii (feet) Sight Distance (feet)
Local 30 275 300
Collector 35 350 350
Arterial 40 500 400
  (15)
Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees occur in the alignment of a marginal access or local street or road, a curve of reasonable radius shall be introduced. A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, commercial or industrial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares the centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or county road superintendent. On collector, commercial or industrial service streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 350 feet. On local streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical.
(16)
Relationship of streets to topography. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage and stormwater runoff objectives set forth in this chapter and street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography.
(17)
Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares shall be established by the state department of transportation or county road superintendent. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions make this impractical. Grades on local streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All streets should have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent.
(18)
Access to arterial roads. When a subdivision is proposed with frontage along an existing arterial road, or state numbered highway, every attempt must be made to provide an access road or frontage road for direct access to the proposed lots. The planning commission shall evaluate this requirement in an attempt to reduce the number and frequency of curb cuts along arterial roads and state numbered highways. Where a driveway or curb cut along a state highway is necessary, approval from the state department of transportation must be submitted when the preliminary subdivision plat is submitted to the department of planning and zoning for approval.

(a)
Within unsubdivided developments, all private streets and accessways shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
(b)
Whenever a road in an unsubdivided development connects two or more collector or arterial streets in such a manner that any substantial volume of through traffic is likely to make use of this road, such road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards applicable to subdivision streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when roads in unsubdivided developments within the county are constructed in accordance with the specifications for subdivision streets, the county may accept an offer of dedication of such streets.
(c)
In all unsubdivided residential developments, sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling units with other dwelling units, the public street and on-site activity centers such as parking areas, laundry facilities and recreational areas and facilities.
(d)
Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet to provide such access.
(e)
The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least four feet wide and constructed according to the specifications set forth in section 34-246, except that the permit-issuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed with other suitable materials when it concludes that:
