Chapter 127 - WATERSHED PROTECTION

Sec. 127-1. - Watershed protection areas.
Watershed protection areas are hereby identified, classified, and regulated for the purpose of insuring the preservation and improvement of water quality and for complying with laws of the State of Georgia. The following definitions shall be utilized in the administration of this chapter:
Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas.
Corridor means all land within the buffer areas and other setback areas.
Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface which prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, paved roads, paved driveways, paved parking lots, swimming pools, or patios.
Large water supply watershed means a watershed area which is greater than 100 square miles as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division.
Nitrification field means any system for the on-site disposal of wastewater.
Perennial stream means a stream that has normal stream flow consisting of base flow (discharge that enters the stream channel mainly from groundwater) or both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year.
Reservoir means an existing or future impoundment of water for water supply purposes as identified by resolution of the city council.
Small water supply watershed means a watershed area which is less than 100 square miles as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division.
State water means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, homeowners association, partnership, or corporation. For purposes of this chapter, the county engineer shall make state water determinations. Recorded drainage easements and ditches/swells used for conveying wet weather flows (i.e., no base flow) shall not be considered state waters.
Stream bank means the uppermost part of the bank marked by a break in slope (as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division). Stream bank is not necessarily the water's edge.
Tributaries and streams means tributaries and streams, whether named or unnamed, that continuously flow to major water supply streams.
Utility means a public or private water or sewer piping system, water or sewer pumping station, electric power line, fuel pipe line, telephone line, road, driveway, bridge, river/lake access facility, stormwater system and/or railroad
Water supply reservoir means a governmentally-owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally-owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the Army Corps of Engineers.
Water supply watershed means the area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake.

Sec. 127-2. - Applicability.
(a)
Exemptions (grandfather provisions). This chapter shall not apply to the following activities:
(1)
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(2)
Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities, including, but not limited to, existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements and with best management practices available.
(3)
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development or scheduled for permit approval.
(4)
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan designed using best management practices, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(5)
The project consisting of approximately 2½ miles of recreational surface trails between four and eight feet in width encircling the Yahoola Creek Reservoir. The project also includes a pavilion, comfort station and informational kiosks at each end of the trail. (Agreement for Project Grant No. NRT-03(17) dated March 4, 2004.)
(b)
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this chapter. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.
(1)
Utility lines paralleling the creek provided that:
a.
The utilities to be located in the buffer or setback areas cannot feasibly be located outside these areas;
b.
The utilities are located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible;
c.
The installation and maintenance of the utilities are such to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible; and
d.
The utilities do not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
(2)
Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this chapter takes effect or approved under the terms of this chapter, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures.
(3)
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property; provided however, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the city on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the city to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
(4)
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and that are not incidental to other land development activity provided that:
a.
The activity is consistent with best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry commission or the Georgia Department of Agriculture; and
b.
The activity does not impair the quality of the drinking water stream.
(c)
Application to watersheds. The following large and small water supply watersheds, designated major water supply streams, named tributaries, minor unnamed streams, and state waters located in and out of the large and small water supply watersheds shall be governed by this chapter.
(1)
Large water supply watersheds: Not applicable.
(2)
Small water supply watersheds: Yahoola Creek Basin.
(3)
Designated major water supply streams: Yahoola Creek.
(4)
Tributaries to water supply streams: Ward Creek.
(5)
Any and all minor unnamed streams which are indicated as perennial on the 1963 (photo revised 1982) U.S.G.S. quad sheets.
