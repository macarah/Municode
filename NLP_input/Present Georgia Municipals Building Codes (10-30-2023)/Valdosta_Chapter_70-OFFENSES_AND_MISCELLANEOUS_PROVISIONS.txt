Prior to any conviction for loitering under this subsection, the offender must have been notified on at least one occasion by a law enforcement officer of the effect of this article, and the location must have been posted with a sign or notice providing that such location is the site of a previous illegal drug transaction. Failure of such individual to vacate the location after having been warned by a law enforcement officer is sufficient to satisfy the notice requirements of this section.

Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer; refuses to identify himself; or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this article, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this article if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the procedure set forth in this subsection, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.
(c)
A sign shall be posted within 100 feet of the parcel of land or actual site of the previous illegal drug transaction. Such sign shall state "No Loitering—Drug Free Zone." In addition, a sign stating "Drug Free Zone" shall be posted on the boundaries of the area designated by the mayor and council as authorized in subsection (d) of this section.
