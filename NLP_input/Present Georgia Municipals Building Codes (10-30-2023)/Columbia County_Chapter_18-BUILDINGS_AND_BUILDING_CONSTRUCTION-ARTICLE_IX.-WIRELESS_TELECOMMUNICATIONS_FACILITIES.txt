Sec. 18-300. - Purpose and legislative intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed Columbia County's authority concerning the placement, construction and alteration of wireless telecommunications facilities. The Columbia County Board of Commissioners finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose a unique hazard to the health, safety, public welfare and environment of Columbia County and its inhabitants. The board of commissioners also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to Columbia County and of significant benefit to Columbia County and its residents. In order to insure that the placement, construction or alteration of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with Columbia County's land use policies, Columbia County is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The intent of this chapter is to minimize the negative impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of Columbia County.
