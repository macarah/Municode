Sec. 2-297. - Exceptions to article.
The following exceptions shall apply to this article:
(1)
The provisions of this article shall not apply where procedures for notice are specified in the constitution of the state or any acts of the General Assembly of the state, or to any judicial proceedings for the municipal court, or to any proceedings under the jurisdiction of any board, authority or commission which may be a joint board, authority or commission with any other governmental entity to which such board, authority or commission may be subject, except when such other governmental entity approves of the procedures provided in this article, which approval shall be evidenced by a resolution of the entity so approving as transmitted to the clerk. However, where any such entity is exercising responsibility for the city to enforce an ordinance or provision of the Code of the city, the approval of the entity shall be unnecessary.
(2)
The provisions of this article shall not apply to any notice directed to any other governmental agency or entity or to any officer or employee therein acting in an official capacity.
(3)
The address provided to the city in any return, application, request or petition shall constitute the address to which notice pursuant to this article shall be directed by the city for the purpose of effecting notice to any party pertaining to the subject matter of the application, request or petition.
(4)
Any party who is not a resident of the county who may at any future time be entitled to receive written notice from the city may file with the clerk an address and the name of a person at such address, which shall be considered the address and premises and named party to which any notice shall be directed which the city may be required to give. Such information shall remain effective until changed by the party who provided such information to the clerk or until any limit of time expires on the request to the clerk, whichever event first occurs. Notice pursuant to the terms of this article directed to any person named in such request and at the address contained therein shall constitute sufficient notice where all other provisions of this article are complied with. The clerk shall transmit to any entity to which this article is applicable as provided in subsection 2-303(a) any information filed pursuant to this subsection and any revision of such information, and shall transmit to all department heads of the city similar information.
(5)
The provisions of this article shall not be construed to apply by implication to any procedure for notice now or hereafter employed by any department of the city when notice is not required by ordinance or statute.
(Code 1976, § 2-9007)
Sec. 2-298. - Conflicting provisions.
The provisions of this article are not applicable to any ordinance of the city which contains notice provisions therein that conflict with those set forth in this article, and the provisions of such ordinances shall be controlling.
(Code 1976, § 2-9008)
Sec. 2-299. - Personal notice.
The representative of the city required to provide notice shall proceed to effect personal notice to the party entitled to notice. Personal notice may be provided either by personal delivery or by mailed delivery to the party entitled to notice in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)
Personal delivery. Personal delivery shall be effected by an authorized employee of the city presenting the notice to the named party entitled to receive the notice. The following individuals shall be authorized representatives of the city for the purpose of personal delivery: employees of the department instituting the procedure under which the notice is required to be given, the city attorney, or authorized representatives, departments or agencies designated by instruction of the mayor. If personal service cannot be effected for the reason that the person entitled to receive notice refuses to accept personal delivery of the notice, notice shall be effected by leaving the notice in the presence of such party, or notice may be effected by mailed delivery.
(2)
Mailed delivery. Notice to the party entitled to receive notice may be given by placing a copy of the notice in the United States mail, addressed to the party entitled to receive notice, with adequate postage thereon, and shall be sent by certified mail to the addressee only, with a return receipt. If the party entitled to notice fails to accept mailed delivery, the notice may be effected by utilizing the procedure described in this subsection for mailed notice, directing the notice to the address of the party entitled to receive the notice rather than to the addressee only. Mailed delivery, rather than personal delivery, shall be provided to any party entitled to notice whose address is outside of the city.
(Code 1976, § 2-9002)
Sec. 2-300. - Published notice.
Whenever it is impossible to determine the address of any party entitled to receive notice by either locating the party's person or address, notice may be given to the party by publishing notice in the Savannah Evening Press either as a legal notice or as a special notice. The notice shall be published two times on two consecutive days not less than five days prior to the scheduled hearing, meeting or intended action. An affidavit shall be obtained from the appropriate employee or official of the newspaper containing a copy of the notice which was advertised, and specifying therein the dates on which the notice was advertised.
(Code 1976, § 2-9003)

If the property is real property, the description shall refer to a lot, block and ward description or to a street address, whichever reference may more clearly inform the party entitled to notice of the location of the property. If the property is personal property, to the extent the information is available, a generic description of the article which indicates its use or purpose, the name of the manufacturer, the manufacturer's identification number, the model and the year of manufacture shall be included.
