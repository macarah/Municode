In the case of any pre-existing junkyard which in its present location blocks or spoils any scenic view in the county, if the owner agrees at any time to re-locate the existing junkyard to a different location or to provide effective screening as described in this chapter as approved by the building permit department; then the governing authority may grant a waiver from all county permit fees, so long as all applicable state, federal and local laws are otherwise complied with.

Sec. 22-59. - Variances.
The mere existence of a nonconforming junkyard shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance for the additional establishment, re-building, expansion, or modification, of a junkyard. Upon written request, a variance from some or all of the requirements of this chapter may be granted at the discretion of the zoning board, if the board finds all of the following conditions exist:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from the location, size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands in the area.
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar junkyard owners.
(3)
Granting the variance will not confer upon the property or the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other properties or junkyard owners.
(4)
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the community or to the public health or general welfare.
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of or aggravated by actions, failures, or omissions of the applicant, or such circumstances do not arise when there are pre-existing violations of any codes or laws by the applicant.
(6)
The variance would be a minimum variance which will make possible the logical use of the land.
