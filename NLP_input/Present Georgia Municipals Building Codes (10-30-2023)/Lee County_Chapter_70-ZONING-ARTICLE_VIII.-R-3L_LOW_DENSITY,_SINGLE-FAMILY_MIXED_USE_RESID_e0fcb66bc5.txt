ARTICLE VIII. - R-3L LOW DENSITY, SINGLE-FAMILY MIXED USE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 70-260. - Statement of purpose.
This district is composed of certain areas having both rural and single-family residential characteristics and areas where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur in the future. The district is also characterized by very low density of housing as well as permitting uses that are associated with rural areas. It is designed to accommodate residential development opportunities for those who desire exurban, low density, or estate living and are willing to live in more remote locations and to assume the costs of providing many of their own services and amenities. The public provision of these amenities is precluded because the county must concentrate its limited resources in areas where more intense future development is logical. The low intensity allowed in this district is similarly necessitated by the county's need to preserve and support the existing public infrastructure. Accordingly, capital improvements such as highways and major sewer interceptors will be directed away from this district. The low densities permitted in this district generally permit on-site septic systems and wells, thereby reducing public capital expenditures.
