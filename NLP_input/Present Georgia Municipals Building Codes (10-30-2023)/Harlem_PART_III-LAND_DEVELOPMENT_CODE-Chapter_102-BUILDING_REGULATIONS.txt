ARTICLE III. - MOTHBALLING OF STRUCTURES

Sec. 102-40. - Vacant structures.
Owners(s) of a vacant structure may elect to close or "mothball" the structure if the structure is vacant and unfit for human habitation and occupancy, and it is not dilapidated, unsafe, unsanitary, or in danger of structural collapse. Mothballing is defined as a method used to protect a vacant structure from weather damage and vandals while preserving the structure for future use. The goal of mothballing is to temporarily protect the property to allow the owner to plan the property's future, or acquire funds for preservation, rehabilitation or restoration.
(Ord. No. 2001, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-41. - Registration of vacant and abandoned buildings.
(a)
Registration. Owners of vacant buildings may elect to mothball in lieu of repairing or demolishing the structure. Prior to mothballing, owners must register their properties pursuant to chapter 102, article IV of this Code. Further, owners electing to mothball must indicate this decision on the forms associated with registration of vacant or foreclosed property. Upon registration of the property, the community development department will issue a mothballing permit. Within ten days of completion of the mothballing, the property owner must contact the community development department to schedule an initial compliance inspection. The property will be inspected annually for compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.
(b)
Mothballing permit. The cost of the mothballing permit is $25.00, which includes the compliance inspection. A separate building permit may be required for building repairs.
(Ord. No. 2001, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-42. - Procedures.
(a)
Specific mothballing procedures. The three highest priorities for a mothballed building are:
(1)
To protect the building from sudden loss;
(2)
To weatherize and maintain the property to stop moisture penetration; and
(3)
To control the humidity levels inside once the building has been secured.
(b)
General mothballing procedures.
(1)
A properly mothballed building will have a watertight roof, secured doors and windows, repaired or stabilized rot problems, painted wood, repaired masonry, and well-maintained grounds. All trash, debris, garbage should be removed from inside, outside and under the house.
(2)
To ensure compliance with this section, the property owner, at a minimum, should take the following actions:
a.
The building's roof should be weather tight. Missing shingles should be replaced, holes should be repaired. Rolled roofing is acceptable as a temporary repair material but if it is used, it must be securely installed.
b.
Windows should be covered on the exterior with high grade plywood cut to fit within the window opening. Window coverings should be attached with screws to minimize damage to the window when they are removed. Window coverings should be painted a flat color (such as dark gray or black, or a color that matches the building).
c.
The water should be turned off and the pipes drained. If the building has a functional sprinkler system, it should remain operational.
d.
All electrical systems not necessary for security, fire prevention, and/or ventilation should be disconnected.
e.
Exterior walls and exterior surfaces shall be free of breaks, holes, loose or missing materials to prevent deterioration. All exterior surfaces shall be repaired and protected from the elements including, but not limited to, porches, decks, balconies and fences. All metal surfaces subject to rust or corrosion shall be coated to inhibit such rust and corrosion. Gutters should be cleaned and inspected to verify that they discharge away from the building. Corrective measures should be taken as necessary.
f.
Potential points for water intrusion, like crawlspace openings and basement windows, should be blocked and the water diverted away from the building; however, basement and crawlspace ventilation shall be maintained.
g.
Loose architectural elements like brackets that should be documented, removed, and stored on site. Securely attached material should not be removed.
h.
Chimneys should be securely blocked with heavy duty wire mesh to prevent animal intrusion.
i.
The building should be adequately ventilated. Small openings covered with heavy duty wire mesh at the top of window coverings may be adequate. In humid climates, forced air ventilation may be necessary.
j.
Vegetation around the building should be pruned back from the walls a minimum of 12 inches to allow good airflow. Overhanging dead tree limbs and branches should be removed. The property grounds shall be maintained at all times (including bushes, beds, and other vegetation), the grass shall not exceed six inches in height and the property shall be kept free of trash and debris at all times.
k.
The owner shall establish a monitoring and maintenance schedule for the building. The schedule, at a minimum, should require that a drive-by inspection be done on a monthly basis, that a walk around be done every three months, and that the building be entered and inspected annually.
(Ord. No. 2001, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-43. - Mothballing; boarding specifications.
The property owner must comply with minimum requirements regarding windows, exterior doors and other openings in exterior walls of vacant structures. These minimum requirements shall be enumerated in regulations adopted by the planning commission and approved by the city council or in regulations adopted by the city council.
(Ord. No. 2001, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-44. - Completion period.
(a)
Period of completion. Owners of vacant structures shall have 90 days from date of issuance of the mothballing permit to complete mothballing the building, in compliance with this subchapter and regulations adopted by the planning commission and approved by the city council or regulations adopted by the city council.
(b)
Extension. The community development department may extend the completion period up to 90 days based on unusual circumstances and financial hardships.
(Ord. No. 2001, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-45. - Initial compliance inspection.
(a)
Initial compliance inspection. The community development department will conduct an initial mothballing compliance inspection of the building, and shall issue an acceptance certificate if the property owner has substantially complied with the requirements as set forth in this subchapter and in regulations adopted by the planning commission and approved by the city council or regulations adopted by the city council.
(b)
Non-acceptance. If the owner has not substantially complied with the requirements of this subchapter and/or the regulations adopted by the planning commission and approved by the city council or regulations adopted by the city council, the department shall issue a notice of non-acceptance during the initial compliance inspection, the department shall provide the owner with a copy of the noted deficit area(s). The building owner will have 30 days from the date of the inspection within which to take corrective action(s) and request another compliance inspection. The owner may be subject to other enforcement proceedings under this code if the department notes the structure as nonacceptance during a follow-up compliance inspection.
(Ord. No. 2001, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-46. - Annual compliance inspections.
To ensure compliance, the community development department will conduct annual inspections of all structures registered under this subchapter. The fee for such inspection shall be $25.00.
(Ord. No. 2001, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-47. - Enforcement.
The community development department will be responsible for enforcing compliance with the mothballing ordinance.

ARTICLE IV. - VACANT AND FORECLOSED REAL PROPERTY

Sec. 102-50. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "Registration of Vacant and Foreclosed Real Property."
(Ord. No. 2002, 5-21-2020)
Sec. 102-51. - Findings and intent.
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. As such, the city finds:
(1)
There is a need to establish a mechanism to register foreclosed and vacant real property in order to protect property values for all property owners;
(2)
Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that have been foreclosed or recently subject to transfer of ownership after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted;
(3)
Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property, can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities and difficulties often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property;
(4)
There is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this chapter; and
(5)
The implementation and enforcement of foreclosure and vacant real property registry will circumvent the above recognized problems and will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of the Code of Ordinances of Harlem, Georgia.
(Ord. No. 2002, 5-21-2020)

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2310, adopted Aug. 28, 2023, amended the Code by the addition of Art. VI, §§ 102-89—102-99; however, said provisions have been redesignated as §§ 102-99—102-109, at the editor's discretion, for purposes of allowing future expansion of the Code.

Sec. 102-99. - Purpose and applicability.
The purpose of exterior lighting regulations is to provide outdoor illumination sufficient for safety, security, and convenience while reducing glare and light pollution that result from excessive and improperly designed light fixtures and to conserve energy by promoting efficient and cost-effective lighting alternatives within the Military Lighting Overlay District.
These regulations apply to all new commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential buildings and sites and to any renovation of existing commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential structures and sites within the city limits and located within the Military Lighting Overlay District.
(Ord. No. 2310 , 8-28-2023)
Sec. 102-100. - Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the interpretation of certain terms associated with outdoor lighting shall have the following meanings:
Existing light fixtures means outdoor light fixtures already installed at the time of the adoption of this section.
Foot candle (fc) means the illuminance measured one foot from a light source.
Full cutoff means a shielded light fixture that emits no light above a horizontal plane touching the lowest part of the fixture.
Glare means the sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted that causes annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.
Illuminance or luminance means the intensity of light in a specified direction measured at a specified point.
Light fixture means the assembly that holds or contains a lamp or bulb and may include an assembly housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and a refractor or lens. A light fixture also includes the assembly for luminous tubes and fluorescent lighting.
Light pollution means any adverse effect of man-made light and is often used to denote urban sky glow.
Light trespass means light emitted by a lighting installation that falls outside the boundaries of the property on which the installation is sited.
Lumen means the unit of luminous flux, the total amount of light falling uniformly on or passing through an area of one square foot, each of which is one foot from a one-candela source, yielding an illuminance of one foot candle at that distance. The output of lamps and bulbs is customarily measured in lumens. A common 100-watt incandescent light bulb, for example, has an output of less than 1,800 lumens.

(c)
Intense light-producing activities. Any activity producing intense light, whether from floodlights or from high-temperature processes, such as combustion or welding or otherwise, shall be performed within an enclosure so as to completely obscure and shield the light from view from any point along the lot lines of the property or from the sky, except during the period of construction or repair of improvements on the property.
(d)
Shielding required. All light bulbs used for the illumination of business establishments or for the illumination of business buildings or areas surrounding them, or for the illumination or display of merchandise or products of business establishments, shall be completely shielded from the view of vehicular traffic using streets abutting such business properties. Flood lights used for the illumination of a building or any sign thereon, whether or not such flood lights are attached to or separate from the building, are permitted but the lighting shall not project beyond the sign, or the wall being illuminated. Examples of local lighting fixtures on streets and pedestrian facilities are presented in Table 1.
