Sec. 3.10. - General power and authority.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided by this Charter, the city council shall be vested with all the powers of government of this city as provided by Article I of this Charter.
(b)
In addition to all other powers conferred upon it by law, the city council shall have the authority to adopt and provide for the execution of such ordinances, resolutions, rules, and regulations, not inconsistent with this Charter and with the Constitution and the laws of the State of Georgia, which it shall deem necessary, expedient, or helpful for the peace, good order, protection of life and property, health, welfare, sanitation, comfort, convenience, prosperity, or well-being of the inhabitants of the City of South Fulton and may enforce such ordinances by imposing penalties for violations thereof.
(c)
Except for the office of city manager, the city council, by resolution, may establish, abolish, merge, or consolidate offices, positions of employment, departments, and agencies of the city as it shall deem necessary for the proper administration of the affairs of the government of the city. The council shall prescribe the functions and duties of departments, offices, and agencies; may provide that the same person shall fill any number of offices or positions of employment; and may transfer or change the functions and duties of offices, positions of employment, departments, and agencies of the city.
(d)
The operations and responsibilities of each department now or hereafter established in the city shall be distributed among such divisions or bureaus as may be provided by ordinance of the city council. Each department shall consist of such officers, employees, and positions of employment as may be provided by this Charter or by ordinance and shall be subject to the general supervision and guidance of the mayor and councilmembers.
(e)
In all cases, unless otherwise prohibited by this Charter or by state law, those functions and duties necessary for the efficient and proper administration of the affairs of government of the city may be provided through intergovernmental agreements or private contracts or both.
Sec. 3.10A. - Role delineation.
Based upon the firm belief that the proper, efficient, and effective administration and operation of the city's council-manager form of government will be fostered by a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the city council, mayor, and city manager, this section states the following principles, which are intended to be fully consistent with this article:
(1)
The full and complete legislative and policy making authority of the city resides in the part-time city council, and the full-time city manager shall take no action which impinges upon or interferes with the city council's policy making role. Other than providing information relevant and germane to the city council's legislative deliberations, the city manager shall strive to remain a neutral party in such legislative deliberations. To ensure the actuality and appearance of neutrality, neither the city manager nor any department heads shall participate in any political activity on behalf of the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices, nor shall the city manager or any department head make any political contribution to the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices. The mayor and councilmembers shall not solicit or accept any campaign contributions from any city employee;
(2)
The city manager is the full-time chief executive officer of the city, and, as such, all department heads, except the city attorney who is appointed by and reports to the mayor and council, report to the city manager. The mayor and council shall observe the management authority of the city manager;
(3)
Except as otherwise provided in this charter, the mayor and councilmembers shall not in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of any city administrative officers or employees whom the city manager or any of his or her subordinates are empowered to appoint;
(4)
Except for the purpose of conducting an investigation or inquiry authorized by the city council pursuant to Section 3.12 of this charter, the mayor and councilmembers shall deal with city officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the city manager solely through the city manager, and neither the mayor nor any councilmembers shall give orders to any such officers or employees either publicly or privately;
(5)
The mayor and city council shall not give directives to any city officers or employees, other than the city manager or city attorney, regarding any matters including, but not limited to, constituent complaints and complaints regarding the services, operation, or administration of any department or function of city government. Although the mayor and city council shall not be prohibited from communicating with city officers or employees with constituent complaints or concerns, the city manager must be copied on all such communications;
(6)
The mayor and councilmembers, unless acting pursuant to a duly authorized investigation or inquiry, shall not discuss in open session the performance of or complaints against any city officer or employee during a city council meeting. This provision is not intended to prevent the mayor or city council from discussing, in general terms, the performance of or any issue relating to any department or function of city government;
(7)
It shall be prohibited for the mayor or any councilmember to sit in on personnel and management meetings between the city manager and city employees unless such participation is consented to by the city manager and approved by the city council;
(8)
The mayor shall have no management authority or responsibility with respect to the operations and administration of city government; and
(9)
The mayor and council, as elected officials, shall possess fundamental oversight duties and responsibilities with respect to all operations and administration of city government, and the city manager shall be responsible and duty bound to facilitate the mayor and city council's oversight function. Once the city council has passed the operating and capital budgets of the city, it shall be the responsibility of the city manager to administer such budgets and to keep the mayor and city council fully informed as to the city's progress against such budgets. The city manager shall provide monthly financial updates on the budgets with year to date information, and such updates shall contain all material information necessary for the mayor and city council to evaluate the financial performance and condition of the city. However, once the city council has appropriated funds in the budget and encumbered such funds through subsequent legislative action, the city manager shall have the authority to administer such budget including contract administration and account payables as part of the management function. Any expenditure of city funds directly by the mayor and individual councilmembers, whether by purchasing card or other means, shall be subject to the approval of the city manager as his or her duty to administer the city's budget, and the city manager shall have the authority to have such expenditures forensically audited.

Sec. 3.11. - Organization.
(a)
The city council shall hold an organizational meeting not later than the first regular meeting in January following an election. The meeting shall be called to order by the mayor-elect, and the oath of office shall be administered to the newly elected mayor and councilmembers by a judicial officer authorized to administer the oaths required by Chapter 3 of Title 45 of the O.C.G.A. and the following oath:
"I do solemnly (swear) (affirm) that I will faithfully perform the duties of (mayor) (councilmember) of this city and that I will support and defend the Charter thereof as well as the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and of the United States of America."
(b)
Following the induction of the mayor and councilmembers, the city council, by a majority vote, shall elect a councilmember to serve as mayor pro tempore.

Sec. 3.13. - Meetings.
(a)
The city council shall, at least once during each calendar month, hold regular meetings at such times and places as prescribed by ordinance.

(b)
Special meetings of the city council may be held on call of the mayor or five members of the city council. The minutes of any such special meeting not called by the mayor shall indicate which councilmembers called the meeting. Notice of such special meeting shall be served on all other members personally, or by telephone personally, at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Such notice to councilmembers shall not be required if the mayor and all councilmembers are present when the special meeting is called. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a councilmember in writing before or after such a meeting and attendance at the meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice on any business transacted in such councilmember's presence. Written or oral notice of such special meeting shall be given at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to the legal organ of Fulton County and to a newspaper of general circulation in the county. Notice shall also be posted for at least 24 hours at the place of regular meetings and on the city's website. Upon written request from any local broadcast or print media outlet whose place of business and physical facilities are located in the county, notice shall be provided by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail to that requesting media outlet at least 24 hours in advance of the called meeting. Only the business stated in the call may be transacted at the special meeting.
(c)
All meetings of the city council shall be public to the extent required by law and notice to the public of special meetings shall be given as required by law.

Except as otherwise provided in this Charter, the affirmative vote of a majority of the councilmembers present shall be required for the adoption of any ordinance, resolution, or motion.

(b)
A new or amended ordinance may be proposed by the mayor or councilmember at a regular or special meeting of the city council.

An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of a majority of the councilmembers present shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency continues to exist. An emergency ordinance shall also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances.
Sec. 3.19. - Codes.

(b)
The mayor, within five business days following receipt of an ordinance, resolution, or other action adopted by the city council, shall return it to the city clerk with or without the mayor's approval or with the mayor's veto. If an ordinance, resolution, or other action adopted by the city council has been approved by the mayor or if it is returned to the city clerk neither approved nor disapproved, it shall become law upon its return to the city clerk. However, if the mayor fails to return an ordinance, resolution, or other action adopted by the city council to the city clerk within five business days of receipt, it shall become law at 12:00 Midnight on the fifth business day after receipt. If an ordinance, resolution, or other action adopted by the city council is vetoed by the mayor, the mayor shall submit to city council, through the city clerk, the reason for the mayor's veto. The city clerk shall record upon the ordinance, resolution, or other action adopted by the city council the date of its delivery to and its receipt from the mayor.
(c)
An ordinance, resolution, or other action adopted by the city council vetoed by the mayor shall automatically be on the agenda at the next regular meeting of the city council for reconsideration. Votes to override mayoral vetoes shall only occur at regular scheduled meetings of the city council, and cannot occur at a special meeting or emergency meeting. If the minimum number of councilmembers necessary to vote to override the veto are not present, the action may be continued until the next meeting at which such minimum number of councilmembers are present. The city council may override a veto by the mayor and adopt any ordinance, resolution, or other action adopted by the city council that has been vetoed by the mayor by the affirmative votes of at least five councilmembers, not including the mayor.
