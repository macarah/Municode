ARTICLE II. - PURPOSE

Sec. 28-21. - Purpose.
(a)
The zoning regulations and districts herein established have been developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan (master plan) and are designed:
(1)
To lessen congestion in the streets;
(2)
To secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers;
(3)
To promote health and the general welfare;
(4)
To provide adequate light and air;
(5)
To prevent overcrowding of the land;
(6)
To avoid undue concentration of populations;
(7)
To facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements;
(8)
To protect the tax base.
The regulations have also been made with reasonable consideration for particular uses; with a view to promote desirable living conditions, sustaining the stability of neighborhoods, protecting property against blight and depreciation, promoting aesthetics, securing economy in governmental expenditures, and preservation of revenue, conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and structures.
(b)
The requirements set forth in this chapter are minimum permissible standards. It is expected that developers, property owners, the municipal planning commission, and the city council will normally strive for quality development which will exceed these minimum requirements.
(c)
Changes in zoning and land use classifications will be made only if they bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare. Changes will be granted where the existing classification or zoning results in little or no gain or benefit to the public while inflicting serious injury or loss on the landowner.
