ARTICLE 19. - BUFFERS, TREE PROTECTION AND LANDSCAPING

Sec. 19.1. - Purpose and Intent.
Trees improve air and water quality, reduce soil erosion, reduce noise and glare, provide habitat for desirable wildlife, moderate the climate, and enhance community image and property values. Therefore, it is the intent of these regulations to encourage the protection and provision of trees through sound, responsible land development practices. Landscaping enhances a community's environmental and visual character and improves the overall quality of life. Vegetation can also improve air and water quality, reduce soil erosion, reduce noise and glare, provide habitat for wildlife, moderate the climate, and enhance property values, thus protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the community.
It is the purpose of this Article to provide environmentally sound landscape amenities and buffers which promote a positive community image by promoting quality development, enhancing property values, providing for landscape improvements in the city, and promoting orderly growth and aesthetic quality in the city. It is also the intent to promote a healthy, natural environment whenever possible by protecting and enhancing existing vegetation.
This Article also establishes standards for buffers and landscape strips. Buffers between two incompatible uses minimize harmful impacts such as transmission of noise, dust, and glare. Buffers can also lessen visual pollution, establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, and thus protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the community.
Sec. 19.2. - Buffer Required.
Buffers, as defined and illustrated in Article 2, shall be required as specified in this Zoning Ordinance (see Table 9.2). Buffers shall also be required for particular uses when specified in any other article of this Zoning Ordinance.
Sec. 19.3. - Buffers to Be Shown on Plans and Plats.
All buffers required by this Zoning Ordinance or provided by a development shall be delineated on plans as buffers and tree save areas, unless the applicant clearly demonstrates the need for disturbance.
Sec. 19.4. - Screening Required and Screening Specifications.
All buffers shall provide screening as defined. Where another provision of this Zoning Ordinance requires screening, such screening shall require compliance with this Section.
Minimum required screening shall consist of a natural buffer utilizing existing vegetation or a structural buffer, whichever provides an opaque visual screen to a height of six (6) feet, or any combination of existing and replanted vegetation which can reasonably be expected by the Zoning Administrator to create an opaque visual screen six (6) feet high within two (2) growing seasons. Where another provision of this Zoning Ordinance has different specifications for screening, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.
To achieve maximum opacity within buffers, the following alternatives, or combination thereof, shall be considered by the applicant and applied, subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator:
(a)
Six-foot-high evergreen screening shrubs planted four (4) feet on center.
(b)
Tall evergreen trees stagger planted with branches touching ground.
(c)
Combination of small shrubs planted thirty inches (30") on center, small trees planted thirty (30) feet on center, and large trees planted forty (40) feet on center.
(d)
Six-foot (6') high masonry wall (i.e., structural buffer).
Sec. 19.5. - Buffer Materials.
It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that, when a buffer is required, the buffer shall consist of natural, undisturbed vegetation. However, replanting of a buffer shall be required where sparsely vegetated or where screening as required by this Article cannot be provided with existing natural vegetation. This is the intent whether or not the term "natural" buffer or "natural, undisturbed" buffer is used.
Where disturbance of a required buffer is permitted by this Article, it must be replanted to a standard acceptable to provide screening as defined, and as determined appropriate by the Zoning Administrator. Natural buffers may contain deciduous or perennial vegetation, but they shall contain evergreen shrubs and trees suitable to local growing conditions that will provide a six (6) foot high opaque visual screen during all seasons of the year.
Sec. 19.6. - Buffer Encroachments.
(a)
Uses Limited. Buffers shall contain no driveways, parking areas, patios, stormwater detention facilities, or any other structures or accessory uses except in the case of structural buffers, within which a fence, wall or earthen berm is constructed to provide the visual screening required to meet the standards of this Article.
(b)
Utilities. Underground utilities may be permitted to cross a buffer if the screening standards of this Article will be subsequently achieved to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.
(c)
Access. Required vehicular and pedestrian access will be allowed through a buffer.
Sec. 19.7. - Waiver of Required Buffer.
The Governing Body may, at the time of application for rezoning or conditional use, waive a buffer requirement of this Zoning Ordinance if the Comprehensive Plan anticipates future development on the adjoining property in a land use category (shown on the future land use plan map) such that a buffer would not be required by this Zoning Ordinance.
Sec. 19.8. - Reduction of Natural Buffer by Installing Structural Buffer.
If a structural buffer is provided that creates an opaque screen to a height of no less than six (6) feet, the minimum required buffer width may be reduced by up to fifty (50) percent.
Sec. 19.9. - Specifications for Structural Buffers.
Structural buffers, when installed as an alternative to a natural buffer, shall meet the following criteria, which shall be shown and compliance demonstrated on plans submitted for a land development permit as required by the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
(a)
Planting. Structural buffers shall be vegetated throughout the minimum area required for the buffer on both sides of any fences or walls and upon any earthen berms, which may include grass, ground covers, shrubs, and trees.
(b)
Slope and Location of Berms. All earthen berms shall have a maximum side slope of 2 horizontal to 1 vertical. Earthen berms shall not be constructed within the drip line of any existing trees that will remain on the property.
(c)
Tree Planting Specifications. Trees shall be located or planted within any structural buffer at a density of no less than one tree for each twenty (20) feet of buffer length or portion thereof. New trees shall have a caliper of no less than two (2) inches upon planting and may be clustered for decorative effect following professional landscaping standards for spacing, location, and design.
(d)
Fence Material. Fences and freestanding walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property and shall be located no closer to the property line than three (3) feet. Shrubs, ground covers, or other vegetation shall be provided between the fence or wall and the property line so as to provide a decorative effect, as proposed by a registered landscaped architect or as approved by the Zoning Administrator. Fences used in buffers must be made of rot-resistant material or protected from deterioration with water-proofing material.
Sec. 19.10. - Maintenance of Buffers and Structural Buffers.
Every buffer and structural buffer required by this Zoning Ordinance shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the buffer is located, so as to provide an opaque visual screen to a height of six (6) feet on a continuous, year-round basis.
Sec. 19.11. - Stream Protection Buffers.
In addition to the buffers specified in Table 9.2 or elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance, properties shall comply as applicable with the stream protection buffer requirements specified in the city's Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance and any other city regulations that specify stream buffers.
Sec. 19.12. - Protection of Trees During Development.
(a)
Tree Protection Required. Developers shall make all reasonable efforts to protect retained trees during the construction process, including but not limited to placing protective barriers around trees and marking such areas with "tree save area" signs; and not grading, excavating, or locating utilities near the critical root zones of trees.
(b)
Protection Devices. Tree protection devices shall be installed prior to the issuance of a land disturbance or development permit for any clearing and/or grading. Tree protection shall consist of chain link fencing, orange laminated plastic fencing supported by posts, rail fencing, or other equivalent restraining material.
