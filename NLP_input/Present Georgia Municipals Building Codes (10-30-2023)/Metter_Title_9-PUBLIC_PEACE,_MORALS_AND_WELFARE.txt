Chapter 9.16 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS
Sections:

9.16.010 - Purpose and findings.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
B.
Findings. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Athens-Clarke County, Georgia; Marietta, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Warner Robins, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; and Smyrna, Georgia; which experiences, we believe are relevant to the issues faced by the city of Metter, Georgia, the mayor and city council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood; increased expenditures for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order; increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described; and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or partially nude conduct in establishments affects the public welfare; and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

Chapter 9.20 - NOISE CONTROL
Sections:

9.20.010 - Declaration of policy.
It is declared to be the policy and purpose of this chapter to assess complaints of noises alleged to exceed the ambient noise levels.
(Ord. of 6-11-07)
9.20.020 - Liberal construction.
This chapter shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.
(Ord. of 6-11-07)
9.20.030 - Definitions.
The following words, phrases and terms as used in this chapter shall have the following meanings:
"Ambient noise level" means the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from all sources, excluding the alleged offensive noise, at the location and approximate time at which a comparison with the alleged offensive noise is to be made.
"Cumulative period" means an additive period of time composed of individual time segments which may be continuous or interrupted.
"Decibel" or "dB" means a unit which denotes the ratio between two quantities which are proportional to power; the number of decibels corresponding to the ratio of two amounts of power is ten (10) times the logarithm to the base of ten (10) of this ratio.
"Hertz" means a unit of measurement of frequency, numerically equal to cycles per second.
"Impulsive noise" means a noise characterized by brief excursions of sound pressures whose peak levels are very much greater than the ambient noise level, such as might be produced by the impact of a pile driver, punch press or a drop hammer, typically with one second or less duration.
"Noise level" means the "A" weighed sound pressure level in decibels obtained by using a sound level meter at slow response with a reference pressure of twenty (20) micropascals. The unit of measurement shall be designated as dBA.
"Person" means a person, firm, association, copartnership, joint venture, corporation or any entity, public or private in nature.
"Simple tone noise" or "pure tone noise" means a noise characterized by the presence of a predominant frequency or frequencies such as might be produced by whistle or hum.
"Sound level meter" means an instrument that meets or exceeds American National Standard Institute's Standard S1.4-1971 for Type 2 sound level meters or an instrument and the associated recording and analyzing equipment which will provide equivalent data.
"Sound pressure level" means a sound pressure level of a sound, in decibels, as defined in ANSI Standards 51.2-1962 and 51.13-1921; that is, twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the pressure of the sound to a reference pressure, which reference pressure shall be 0.0002 dynes per square centimeter.
(Ord. of 6-11-07)
9.20.040 - Prohibited generally.
It shall be unlawful for any person to make, continue, or cause to be made or continued any excessive, unnecessary or unusually loud noise or any noise which either annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of others, within the limits of the city.

It is unlawful for any person to operate any motorcycle or recreational off-road vehicle on or off a public road in such a manner that the noise level exceeds the exterior noise standards specified in Section 9.20.070 of this chapter.
(Ord. of 6-11-07)
9.20.110 - Outdoor recreation activities.
A.
Outdoor recreational activities involving amplified sound, including but not limited to athletic events, sporting events, entertainment events and concerts, may create excessive noise which is detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare and the peace and quiet of the inhabitants of the city and its environs.
B.
The city's existing noise regulations, which require extended off-site measurements of the sound rather than measurements at its source, are very cumbersome and expensive to enforce, especially in connection with outdoor recreational activities.
C.
Limiting sound levels of outdoor activities to ninety (90) dba leq is necessary to protect the public health, safety, welfare and the peace and quiet of the inhabitants of the city.
D.
Limiting sound levels at the source is content neutral. It helps to avoid the problem of complaints being received, and therefore measurements being made and enforcement undertaken, only in connection with certain kinds of activities, or certain kinds of music, which some people may consider objectionable and not other kinds of activities or music which may be just as loud.
E.
A variance procedure can be devised to raise the sound limit or modify the time restrictions upon a showing that a facility, because of its design, location or other characteristics, is capable of handling higher sound levels without substantially increasing the likelihood that violations of the other provisions of this chapter will occur.
F.
It is unlawful for any person to conduct, or permit to be conducted on its property, any outdoor recreational activity, including, but not limited to, entertainment events and concerts at which amplified noise, amplified music, or amplified sound exceeding the following levels is created: ninety (90) dba leq. The noise, music or sound shall be measured at the sound booth or other reasonable location which is not more than one hundred fifty (150) feet from the source. Every person conducting, or permitting to be conducted, on its property, any outdoor recreational activity shall, upon request, permit the City of Metter Police Department, or the chief's designee, to place a sound level monitor (with or without an accompanying staff member) at a location described in this subsection to monitor sound levels.
(Ord. of 6-11-07)
