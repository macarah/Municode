SECTION 21.
(a)
The general obligation bonded indebtedness of the City of Macon which is outstanding on the effective date of this charter shall become the debt and obligation of a special tax district which shall correspond to and be conterminous with the corporate limits of the City of Macon as said corporate limits existed on the day immediately preceding the effective date of this charter. The ad valorem taxes imposed by the City of Macon prior to the effective date of this charter to retire such bonded indebtedness shall continue to be imposed within the special tax district in the same manner and to the same extent that such ad valorem taxes were previously imposed by the City of Macon in accordance with the terms of the obligations of such bonded indebtedness. The commission, as the governing authority of Macon-Bibb County, shall be the successor to the previously existing governing authority of the City of Macon for all purposes relating to such bonded indebtedness, including the enforcement of rights and remedies of bondholders.
(b)
The general obligation bonded indebtedness of Bibb County outstanding on the effective date of this charter shall not be affected by this charter, and the commission, as the governing authority of Macon-Bibb County, shall become the successor to the previously existing governing authority of Bibb County for all purposes relating to such bonded indebtedness, including the enforcement of rights and remedies of bondholders.
(c)
Each special tax district created by this section shall cease to exist upon the full satisfaction of all relative bonded indebtedness, but not later than July 1, 2019. At the time the final special tax district ceases to exist, this section shall stand repealed.
