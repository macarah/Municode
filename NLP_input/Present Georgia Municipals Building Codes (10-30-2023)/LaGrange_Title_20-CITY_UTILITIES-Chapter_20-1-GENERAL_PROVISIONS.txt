Billing.
(1)
All utility bills rendered by the city shall show thereon the billing date and the due date. With the exception of industrial customers, the penalty for failure to pay on or before the due date specified in this paragraph shall be two dollars ($2.00) or five (5) percent of the current month's portion of the bill, (i.e. excluding arrears), whichever is greater. The due date for all customers other than industrial customers shall be not less than fourteen (14) days after the billing date; provided, however, that for any commercial customer whose utility bill is mailed or forwarded for processing and payment to an address or location which is outside or beyond the limits of Troup County, the due date for any such commercial customer shall be not less than twenty-one (21) days after the billing date.
(2)
If any utility customer, other than an industrial customer, shall fail to pay a utility bill by the due date and such customer has not been late in the payment of a utility bill during the immediately preceding eleven (11) calendar months, all applicable late fees will be waived by the city provided such utility bill is paid on or before the disconnection date fixed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (f) hereof.
(3)
The penalty to an industrial customer for failure to pay on or before the due date specified in this section shall be the greater of two dollars ($2.00) or one and one-half (1.5) percent of the current month's portion of the bill (i.e., excluding arrears). The due date for industrial customers shall be not less than thirty (30) days after the billing date shown on the utility bill.
The term "industrial customer" as used herein is a city utility customer who is engaged primarily in the business of manufacturing, assembling, producing, and/or finishing and which does not qualify as a residential, commercial, or institutional customer of the city based on historical uses, customs and practices of the city utility department.
(4)
The requirement contained herein for the payment of a penalty for failure to pay or for late payment of a utility bill shall apply to all utility customers of the city including but not limited to the City of LaGrange or the LaGrange Board of Education.
(5)
If a utility bill shall show a due date which falls on or after the twenty-fifth day of any month but prior to the fourth day of the succeeding month, the due date of such bill shall be automatically extended to the close of business on the fifth day of such succeeding month provided the customer to which such bill is directed shall meet the current total income limitations now or hereafter specified in chapter 20-20 of this Code. Any customer desiring to take advantage of the automatic extension provided hereby prior to receiving the same must make application to the assistant city manager of the city for approval of such extension, and the assistant city manager shall automatically submit a list of those approved to the mayor and council for annual approval.
If the fifth day of the succeeding month specified herein shall fall on a weekend, a holiday or other nonbusiness day, the due date shall be the next day thereafter which is a business day.
(6)
Payments placed in the night deposit box outside city hall will be credited as received the next business day.
(e)
Adjustments to bills. In the event a utility reading is required to be estimated and the necessity of such estimated reading was due to fault or failure of the city, if such fault or failure is not cured or corrected within sixty (60) days after the first estimated reading, the bill shall thereafter be based upon zero consumption and only base charges shall thereafter be assessed until the failure or fault is cured or corrected. When the failure or fault is corrected during such sixty-day period, the customer shall pay the estimated cost of utilities until the cost for estimation is corrected and thereafter shall pay the actual cost of the utilities. If the necessity for estimating utility service is due to fault or failure of the customer which shall continue for a period of sixty (60) days, at the end of such sixty-day period, the customer will be notified in writing to correct the problem, and thereafter the city may continue the estimated billing or may terminate utility service. The customer will be required to pay the amount of any increased back bills, and the excess charges, if any, shall be credited to the customer's account. For commercial and industrial metering problems which require an estimation of service, if the estimate shall result in overpayment, the bill shall be adjusted as required to correct any overpayment, the bill shall be adjusted only for twelve (12) months and any amount due for such twelve-month period shall be paid by the customer.
(f)
Delinquent accounts. As soon as practical after the due date, customers with unpaid utility bills shall be notified in writing that their utility account is delinquent and that service may be terminated. Such notice of delinquency shall include:

The utility account number and the address therefor;

The amount of the bill;
(3)
The reason for the proposed disconnection;
(4)
The date by which the bill must be paid to avoid disconnection; and

Sec. 20-1-8. - Exceptions to termination.
(a)
Disconnection during illness.
(1)
Service will not be disconnected or terminated for nonpayment of a utility bill rendered to a residential customer when such customer or a family member residing at the residence has a serious illness if disconnection or termination of utilities would create a life-threatening situation. The customer must present a written statement from the physician, hospital, clinic or other recognized medical authority identifying the illness, the anticipated duration of such illness and certifying that the utility disconnection would be life-threatening and specifying the particular utility services which are required by the customer as a result of such illness. In such event, the proposed disconnection shall be held in abeyance for the shorter of either the length of the illness or sixty (60) days from the date of such initial written statement.
At the end of such sixty-day period, the customer must pay the subsequent monthly bills when due and, in addition, must pay not less than fifty (50) percent of the amount past due because of such delay of discontinuance or termination. If suitable arrangement for payment acceptable to the city cannot be made, or if the customer fails to make payments as specified, the city may discontinue the utility service.
(2)
Service will not be disconnected or terminated for nonpayment of a utility bill rendered to a residential customer if such customer or family member residing at the residence has a serious illness which would be aggravated by such disconnection or termination. The customer must present a written statement from a physician, hospital, clinic or other recognized medical authority identifying the illness, the anticipated duration of such illness and certifying that the illness would be aggravated by such utility disconnection and specifying the particular utility services which are required by the customer as a result of such illness. In such event, the proposed disconnection shall be held in abeyance for the shorter of either the length of the illness or thirty (30) days from the date of such initial written statement.
At the end of such thirty-day period, the customer must begin paying the current bill each month in addition to not less than fifty (50) percent of the past due because of such delay of this continuance or termination. If suitable arrangement for payment acceptable to the city cannot be made, or if a customer fails to make payments as specified, the city may discontinue the utility service.
(b)
Hardship restrictions. For those residential customers whose utility services are scheduled to be discontinued or terminated for nonpayment during the period of any month beginning on the first day and extending through the fifth day of any such month and who meet the income definitions and requirements now or hereafter set forth in section 20-20-1 and the limitations on income now or hereafter set forth in section 20-20-3(2), upon making written application therefor, shall be exempt from having such utility service terminated provided such utility bill is paid on or before the close of business on the fifth day of such month and provided further that (1) such utilities are in the name of the person making the application for exemption from discontinuance or termination; and (2) appropriate information relating to income of the applicant and the household which is acceptable to the city, shall be provided.
If the utility bill is not paid in full prior to the close of business on the fifth day of the exemption period, the utility service may be discontinued or terminated on or after the sixth day of such month and another application for exemption under this subparagraph cannot be made and will not be granted for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the scheduled termination or discontinuance of such service.
(c)
Seasonal restrictions. Any other rules and regulations notwithstanding, the city shall not discontinue those services to a residential heating customer which are integral to and required for heating such residence as the result of an unpaid utility bill incurred during the winter months from December 1 through the subsequent March 15 if the forecasted local low temperature for a twenty-four-hour period beginning at 8:00 a.m. on the date of the proposed disconnection is below thirty-two (32) degrees Fahrenheit. This restriction will not in any way affect the ability of the city to discontinue water or other utilities not required for heating of the residence.
(Code 1972, § 24-6; Ord. No. 90-63, § 1, 11-27-90; Ord. No. 92-38, § 1, 11-10-92; Ord. No. 93-47, § 1, 9-28-93; Ord. No. 93-49, § 1, 10-12-93; Ord. No. 97-12, § 1, 3-25-97)
Sec. 20-1-9. - Levelized billing.
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 20-1-7 or any other provisions or sections of the Code, eligible customers may receive and be entitled to levelized utility billing, from month to month, subject to and upon the following terms and conditions:
(1)
Eligibility. Customers may receive and be entitled to levelized billing if they:
a.
Are electric and/or gas customers of the city, either residential customers or small commercial customers with an average bill of no more than $5,000.00 per month;
b.
Such customer has exercised the option in writing and elected to receive levelized billing;
c.
Such customer has not been scheduled for or has not had his utility service discontinued for nonpayment in the immediately preceding twelve (12) months and is not currently in arrears.
(2)
a.
The monthly levelized billing amount will be calculated by the city averaging the current months charges with all charges for utility services for the immediate past eleven (11) months, excluding for both periods, fixed charges as defined herein, taxes and any late charges. All appropriate taxes will be billed based on the current month actual charges and late charges will be assessed, if applicable;
b.
The city may in its discretion adjust the levelized billing amount to recover or refund any rate increases or decreases or to adjust for abnormal weather conditions during the fiscal year.
(3)
A penalty will not be charged to a customer on account balances. However, any levelized bill amount which is not paid by the due date will be subject to appropriate penalties. Refunds of credit balances will not be made except upon final billing. A customer may terminate eligibility for levelized billing at any time and at that time pay the balance due or receive the credit balance but in such event, the customer cannot elect to receive levelized billing for a period of at least twelve (12) months from the date of termination;
(4)
If a utility customer shall move to a location not serviced by the city, the balance owed by such customer or the credit due to the customer will be applied to the final bill. If the final billing results in a balance due to the customer, a refund check will be issued to the customer but if there is a balance due to the city, such balance shall be due in full and shall be paid by the due date reflected on the bill;
(5)
If service to a customer shall be cut off or terminated for nonpayment, the account balance is due and must be paid prior to reconnection. Twelve (12) consecutive months of service without termination for nonpayment shall be required before eligibility is restored;
(6)
A utility customer transferring to another eligible location serviced by the city may continue on the levelized billing plan. The billing history of the new location will be used to calculate the level payment amount. If sufficient history is not available due to prolonged vacancy or because the account is new, only the available monthly charges will be averaged and if no history is available, the first months bill be the actual charges and averaging will commence with the second month;
(7)
Fixed charges as used herein shall mean and include water line extension charges, propane to natural gas conversion contract charges, contributions to the share program, elderly discount charges, garbage collection fees, security light fees and fire services fees; and
(8)
Applications for eligible small commercial customers shall be taken only in the months of September, October, November, March, April and May of each year.

Sec. 20-1-12. - SOUL energy efficiency tariff.
(a)
Eligibility. Provided on an optional and voluntary basis to any residential customer who receives service under any electric or natural gas rate subject to availability of budgeted funds.
(b)
Participation. To participate in the program, a customer must request from the city or its designee a cost-effectiveness analysis, satisfy the terms and conditions of this tariff, and sign an efficiency upgrade agreement that defines customer benefits and obligations.
(c)
Energy efficiency plans. The city or its designee will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis and prepare an energy efficiency plan ("plan") identifying recommended upgrades ("upgrades") to improve energy efficiency and lower energy costs.
(d)
Net savings. Recommended upgrades shall be limited to those where the annual SOUL Tariff charge, including program fees and the city's cost for capital, are no greater than eighty (80) percent of the estimated annual benefit from reduction to customer annual utility charges based on current utility rates.
(e)
Copay option. If proposed upgrades do not meet the net savings criterion mentioned above, customers may pay an upfront portion of the project cost so that it qualifies for the program. The city will assume no responsibility for such upfront payments to the contractor performing the upgrades.
(f)
Ownership. If the customer is not the building owner, the building owner must sign an owner agreement consenting to not remove or damage the upgrades, to maintain them, and to provide notice of the benefits and obligations associated with the upgrades at the location to any subsequent owner or occupant/customer before the sale or rental of the property.
(g)
Notice. The building owner must agree in writing as part of the efficiency upgrade agreement (if the owner is the customer) or owner's agreement that a notice of the SOUL tariff will be attached to their property records. Failure to obtain the signature of a successor customer who is renting the premises on the notice form provided by the city or its designee will constitute the owner's acceptance of consequential damages and permission for a tenant or purchaser to break their lease or sales agreement without penalty.
(h)
Existing buildings. Projects that address upgrades to existing buildings deemed unlikely to be habitable or to serve their intended purpose for the duration of city cost recovery will not be approved unless other funding can effect necessary repairs. If a building is a manufactured home, to be eligible it must be affixed to a permanent foundation, fabricated after 1982 and, in the sole opinion of the city, expected to remain at the same location for the term of the customer's efficiency upgrade agreement.
(i)
Approved program operator. City may operate the program directly with its own staff resources or designate an experienced program operator to implement the program.
(j)
Approved contractor. Should the customer determine to proceed with implementing a plan, the city shall determine the appropriate monthly SOUL tariff charge as described below. The customer shall sign the efficiency upgrade agreement and select a contractor from the city or its designee's list of approved contractors.
(k)
Quality assurance. When the energy upgrades are completed and approved following an on-site or telephone inspection by the city or its designee, the contractor shall be paid according to its service provider agreement.
(l)
SOUL tariff charge. The city will recover program costs through monthly SOUL tariff charges assigned to the locations where upgrades are installed and paid by customers receiving utility service at these locations. SOUL tariff charges will be set for a duration not to the exceed eighty (80) percent of the estimated life of upgrades or the length of a full parts and labor warranty, whichever is greater, and in no case longer than twelve (12) years. The SOUL tariff charge and duration of payments will be included in the customer's efficiency upgrade agreement.
(m)
Cost recovery. No sooner than forty-five (45) days after approval by the City or its designee, the customer shall be billed the monthly SOUL tariff charge specified in the efficiency upgrade agreement. The city will bill and collect soul tariff charges until program cost recovery is complete except in certain cases of failed or damaged upgrades as described in this tariff.
(n)
Eligible upgrades. All upgrades must have energy star certification, if applicable. The city or its designee may seek to negotiate with contractors or suppliers for extended warranties to minimize the risk of upgrade failure on behalf of all customers.
(o)
Maintenance of upgrades. Participating customers and building owners (if the customer is not the building owner) must agree, when signing the efficiency upgrade agreement or the owner agreement, to keep the upgrades in place for the duration of SOUL tariff charges, to maintain the upgrades per manufacturers' instructions, and report the failure of any upgrades to the city or its designee as soon as possible. If the upgrade fails, the city or its designee is responsible for determining its cause and for repairing the equipment in a timely manner as long as the owner, customer or occupants did not damage the upgrades.
(p)
Termination of service charge. Once all program costs at a location have been recovered, including the city's cost of capital and any repair expenses associated with the upgrades as described below, the monthly SOUL tariff charge shall no longer be billed except as otherwise described in this tariff.
(q)
Vacancy. If a location at which upgrades have been installed becomes vacant for any reason and utility service is disconnected, SOUL tariff charges will be suspended until a successor customer takes occupancy. If a building owner maintains utility service at the location, the building owner will be billed SOUL tariff charges as part of any charges it incurs while utility service is turned on.
(r)
Extension of SOUL tariff charge. If the monthly SOUL tariff charge is reduced or suspended for any reason, the number of total monthly payments shall be extended until all program costs at the location, including the city's cost of capital and any repair expenses associated with the upgrades, are recovered.
(s)
Tied to the location. Until program cost recovery for upgrades at a location is complete or the upgrades fail as described below, the terms of this tariff shall be binding on the metered structure or facility and any future customer who shall receive service at that location.
(t)
Disconnection for non-payment. The SOUL tariff charges shall be considered an essential part of the customer's bill for utility service, and the city may disconnect the account for non-payment of SOUL tariff charges under the same provisions as for any other utility service.
(u)
Repairs. Should at any future time during the billing of SOUL tariff charges, the city or its designee determine that the installed upgrades are no longer functioning as intended and that the occupant, or building owner if different, did not damage or fail to maintain the upgrades in place, the city shall reduce or suspend the SOUL tariff charge until such time as the city can repair the upgrades. If the upgrades cannot be repaired or replaced cost effectively, the city will waive remaining SOUL tariff charges. If the city or its designee determines the occupant, or building owner if different, did damage or fail to maintain the upgrades, the SOUL tariff charge will remain in effect until all program costs at the location, including the city's cost of capital and any repair expenses associated with the upgrades, are recovered.
