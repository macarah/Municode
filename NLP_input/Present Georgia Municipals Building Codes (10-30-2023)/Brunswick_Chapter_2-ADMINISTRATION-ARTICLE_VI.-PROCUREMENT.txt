(2)
Multistep sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to prepare initially a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
(3)
Local vendor preference. There is established in the City of Brunswick a local vendor privilege. The mayor and board of commissioners believe that proposals awarded to local vendors contribute to the local tax base and benefit the economy of the City of Brunswick and will therefore be given special consideration when bidding. The city shall use all reasonable efforts to encourage participation from local vendors.
a.
A local vendor shall be afforded the opportunity to match the bid amount of the lowest responsive and responsible bid if: (1) the lowest responsive and responsible bidder is not local vendor; (2) the local vendor is the second lowest responsive and responsible bidder; and (3) the local vendor's bid is within two percent or $10,000.00, whichever is less, or within $500.00 of the lowest bid.

If the local vendor does not agree to match the low bid received from the out-of-county vendor within the time specified by the city, the bid shall be awarded to the out-of-county vendor.
b.
In the event that more than one local vendor meets the criteria in subsection (a), the opportunity to match the low bid shall be afforded to the winner of a coin toss by the purchasing agent in a public session where vendors and one or more witness may be present.
c.

(f)
Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to proposals.

Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals, and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.
(g)
Award.

No other factors or criteria will be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made.
(h)
Local vendor preference. There is established in the City of Brunswick a local vendor privilege. The mayor and board of commissioners believe that proposals awarded to local vendors contribute to the local tax base and benefit the economy of the City of Brunswick and will therefore be given special consideration when making a proposal. Local preference shall be included in a request for proposals as an evaluation criterion to be considered by the evaluating team. Two percent of the total points available to each proposer shall be awarded on the basis of whether the proposal was submitted by a local vendor. Local vendors shall be entitled to and shall receive the preference points provided for in this subsection. This local vendor privilege shall not apply where prohibited by state or federal law.
