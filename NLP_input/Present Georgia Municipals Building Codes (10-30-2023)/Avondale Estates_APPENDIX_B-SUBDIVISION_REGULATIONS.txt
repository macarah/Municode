(1)
Principal arterials. Those streets and highways which serve major activity centers and emphasize traffic service rather than abutting land access. Principal arterials include all limited access freeways, expressways, parkways, or roads and carry a high proportion of total area travel on a minimum of mileage.

Collector streets. Those streets which distribute trips from arterial streets to their ultimate origin or destination. Collector streets provide a greater level of land access than arterial streets, may enter or traverse identifiable neighborhoods, and rarely serve significant volumes of through traffic.

Street right-of-way line. The dividing line between a lot, tract, or parcel of land and a continuous street.

Subdivision. The division, development, or redivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land, regardless of its prospective use, into two (2) or more lots either by plat or by metes and bounds description. Where appropriate to the context, the term "subdivision" shall mean the aggregate of all parcels held by one (1) owner or combination of owners and designated to be developed or sold as parcels, related to each other or interdependent through the use of streets, easements or other right-of-way or public facility. For the purpose of these regulations, the following shall not be deemed subdivisions:
(1)
The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots, where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are in accord with the rules and regulations contained herein and with the zoning ordinance as amended and provided that the city manager and city clerk are notified of such combination.
(2)
The separation of previously combined, platted lots provided that the lots created are not reduced below minimum sizes required by the zoning ordinance and provided that the city manager and city clerk are notified of such separation through a plat.

Yard.

Yard, rear. A yard situated between the rear of the principal building and the rear lot line and extending the full width of the lot.
Yard, side. A yard extending the total depth of a lot between the front and rear yards and being that area between the side lot line and that line or lines established by the side wall or walls of the principal structure.
Zoning ordinance. An ordinance of the city regulating uses of property, buildings, and structures in various zoning districts and establishing standards for development of property, buildings, and structures in these districts for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, or general welfare of the city.
