(Ord. of 7-16-2019 )
Sec. 4-50. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited.
(a)
Preamble and purpose.
(1)
Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the city council believes are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
(2)
Moreover, it is the finding of the city council that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity.
(b)
Prohibited activities. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities:
(1)
The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals;
(2)

a.

b.
The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or
c.

(3)
