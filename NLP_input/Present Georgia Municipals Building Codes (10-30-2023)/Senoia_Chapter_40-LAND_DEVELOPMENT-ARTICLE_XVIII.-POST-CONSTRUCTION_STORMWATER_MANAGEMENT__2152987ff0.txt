Editor's note— Ord. No. 20-07 , § 1, adopted Dec. 7, 2020, repealed Art. XVIII., §§ 40-451—40-472 in its entirety, and enacted a new Art. XVIII as set out herein. The former Art. XVIII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 14-02, § 1, adopted Dec. 15, 2014.

Sec. 40-451. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. Proper management of post-construction stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. Additionally, the City of Senoia is required to comply with several state and federal laws, regulations and permits and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quality of post-construction stormwater runoff.

Sec. 40-452. - Compatibility with other regulations.
This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other article, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other article, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other article, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.

Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan, shall include, at a minimum (as applicable):
a.
Topography (minimum of 2-foot contours) and steep slopes (i.e., Areas with slopes freater than 15 percent),
b.

Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors,
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas), and
f.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(3)
Better site design practices for stormwater management: Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM sec. 2.3.
(4)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction: Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
a.
The applicant may choose (A) runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent (A) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (B) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
1.
Runoff reduction - The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first one inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
2.
Water quality - The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
b.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in sec. 40-453, the City of Senoia may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(5)
Stream channel protection: Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
24-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
b.

Preservation of any applicable stream buffer.
(6)
Overbank flood protection: Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event.
(7)
Extreme flood protection: Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(8)
Downstream analysis: Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage areain accordance with sec. 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(9)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance: The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and formally accepted by the City of Senoia, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement, in the form provided by the city, to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system. This plan shall be written in accordance with the requirements in sec. 40-473.
(10)
Modification to off-site facilities: The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures to be located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater at an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated to the city for the purpose, and formally accepted by it, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility.
A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the City of Senoia which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility. To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City of Senoia that the use of an offsite or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas:
a.
Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property;
b.
