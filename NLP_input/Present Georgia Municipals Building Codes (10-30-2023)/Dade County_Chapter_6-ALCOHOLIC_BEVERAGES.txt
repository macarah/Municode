Such temporary license shall be valid for sixty (60) days or until the application for a permanent license is granted or denied by the alcohol board.

The fee for a temporary license shall be set by the governing authority and is in addition to the regular application fee.
(n)
The application shall be in such form as shall be from time to time prescribed by the alcoholic beverage control board.

The hearing and subsequent decision shall occur as part of the agenda at a scheduled alcoholic beverage control board meeting or any continuances thereof or at a specially set called hearing.
(s)
Any material omission, or untrue or misleading information contained in or left out of an original, or renewal application for any license issued under this chapter shall be unlawful, shall be just cause for a denial thereof, and may be punishable as a violation of a county ordinance or may be brought before the alcoholic beverage control board as a civil violation. If any such license has previously been granted under the above circumstances, such material omission, or untrue or misleading information shall constitute cause for the revocation of the license.
(t)
Whenever there shall be a change in any of the facts reported to the alcoholic beverage control board in the application for a license under this chapter after such license has been granted, it shall be the duty of the licensee, within ten (10) days after such change, to report the change to the alcoholic beverage control board in writing, except that if the change of facts is a substantial change that might affect the eligibility for an alcohol license, then such change in facts shall be reported within twenty-four (24) hours by phone and immediately thereafter in person to alcoholic beverage control board.

Similarly, an applicant or a licensee shall report to the alcoholic beverage control board all findings of such violation by any administrative agency, the tax commissioner or county which under this chapter could or would result in revocation or suspension of a license.

Sec. 6-18. - Excise taxes.
(a)
Every purchaser of distilled spirits by the drink shall be liable for a tax thereon at the rate of three (3) percent of the retail price or charge for such drink. Such taxes shall be collected by the licensee licensed under this chapter, and such licensee shall remit the same to the county on or before the tenth day of the succeeding month along with a summary of the licensee's gross sales derived from the sale of distilled spirits by the drink. Gross sales shall include all credit card sales and shall be reported and taxes collected thereon shall be submitted to the county to the same extent as required of cash sales. Each licensee shall be allowed a deduction equal to that rate authorized for deductions from state tax under part V of the Georgia Retailer's and Consumer's Sales and Use Tax Act, O.C.G.A. § 48-8-50, as now written or hereafter amended provided that the tax is not delinquent at the time of payment. It shall be the duty of every such licensee required to make a report and pay any tax levied pursuant to this chapter, to keep and preserve suitable records of the sales taxable pursuant to this chapter, and such other books or accounts as may be necessary to determine the amount of tax due. It shall be the duty of every licensee to keep and preserve such records for a period of three (3) years.
(b)

  (2)
Upon the sale of any wine there is imposed an excise tax of twenty-two cents ($0.22) per liter and a proportionate tax at the same rate on all fractional parts of a liter.
(c)
No county excise tax shall be imposed, levied, or collected in any portion of a county in which a municipality within the county is imposing the same tax.
(d)
The excise taxes imposed shall be paid by the wholesale dealers to the county by the tenth day of each month, based upon the units of beer and wine sold during the previous month. The wholesale dealers shall keep true and correct records of all sales and shipments and shall render a sworn statement of the records accompanying the monthly report to the county. Any tax remaining unpaid at the expiration of fifteen (15) days from the due date shall be delinquent.
(e)
Wholesalers collecting excise taxes shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be the same rate authorized for deductions from state tax under O.C.G.A. § 48-8-50.
(f)
Determination of deficiencies.
(1)
If the county has cause to believe that the return or returns of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the county by any person is not proper, it may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information that is within or may come into its possession. One (1) or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one (1) or more monthly period(s).
(2)
The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the due date of taxes.
(3)
The county shall give to the licensee or wholesaler written notice of its determination regarding a deficiency. The notice may be served personally or by mail, if by mail, such service shall be addressed to the licensee at his address as it appears in the records of the county. Service by mail is complete when mailed with a certificate of service stamped thereon and a copy retained in county files or when delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee.
(4)
Except in the case of failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within thirty (30) days after the tenth day of the month following the calendar month for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within thirty (30) days after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire.
(g)
Determination if no return made.
(1)
If any licensee or wholesaler fails to make a return, the county shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in this county which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is in possession of or may come into the possession of the county official. Written notice shall be given in the manner prescribed above.
(2)
The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the twentieth day of the month following the calendar month for which the amount or any portion thereof would have been returned, until the date of payment.
(h)
Any licensee or wholesaler which fails to pay the tax herein imposed or fails to pay any amount of the tax required to be collected and paid to the county within the time required shall pay a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the tax owed in addition to interest as set forth above.
(i)
The tax levied by this section may be enforced by execution in the same manner as other taxes of the county, and in addition, any failure of payment of such tax shall be grounds for revocation or refusal of the license of the delinquent taxpayer. The governing authority shall administer and enforce the provisions of this section for the collection of the tax herein imposed, and in so doing shall have the power to:
(1)
Examine, or authorize the examination of, books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment, and other facilities of any person subject to the tax, in order to verify the accuracy of any report made, or if no report is made by the operator, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid;
(2)
Require the filing of reports by any person or persons having possession or custody of information relating to the tax herein levied; and
(3)
Allow a credit on any amount due and payable from persons who paid the tax herein levied but who were erroneously or illegally subjected thereto.
