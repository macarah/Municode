Sec. 18-96. - Stream buffer mitigation requirements.
To achieve stream buffer mitigation that is proportional to the extent of the impact and consistent from project to project, all applicants requesting mitigation must follow the standardized processes as described in the Peachtree Corners Stream Buffer Mitigation Bank procedures guide, available as a chapter of the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. The applicant will use the criteria outlined in the procedures guide to determine the amount of creation, restoration, enhancement, and/or preservation required relative to the degree of impact. An applicant has two options for mitigating impacts to an existing stream buffer protection zone as defined in the city stream buffer protection article. The first option is to perform the mitigation on-site in accordance with the procedures described in subsection (1) of this section. The second option is for the applicant to pay a fee to the Peachtree Corners Stormwater Capital Project in accordance with the procedures described in section 18-50(b).
(1)
On-site mitigation. An applicant may mitigate impacts to an existing stream buffer by performing an amount of mitigation that is equivalent to the mitigation requirement on-site in accordance with the on-site mitigation procedures in the procedures guide. If the amount of on-site mitigation is not sufficient to satisfy the mitigation requirement, then the applicant will be required to purchase credits from the Peachtree Corners Stream Buffer Mitigation Bank as described in section 18-50(b).
(2)
In-lieu fee mitigation. An applicant may mitigate impacts to an existing stream buffer by paying a fee to the stormwater capital project in accordance with the fee schedule. The fee will be based on the actual costs of stream buffer restoration and will be approved by the city commission. The fee schedule will be reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect the actual costs of restoration and submitted to the city commission for review and approval.
