If the owner fails to carry out verbal instructions in a timely manner or if a serious violation or hazard to public health exists, the health officer or city may issue to the owner a written order stating the nature of the violation, the corrective action, and the time limit for completing the corrective action. The record of the mailing of said notice or order shall be prima facie evidence thereof.
(c)
Failure to comply with any written order duly issued by the health officer or city pursuant to this article will constitute a violation and be punishable as provided as provided in section 1-11.
(d)
The violation of any provisions of this article, as now existing or as may be hereafter amended, may be enjoined by instituting appropriate proceedings for injunction in the courts of competent jurisdiction in the state. Any public nuisance which is injurious to the public health, safety, or comfort may be abated by instituting appropriate proceedings for injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction in the state. Such actions may be maintained notwithstanding the fact that such violation may also constitute a crime, and notwithstanding that other adequate remedies at law may exist. Such actions may be instituted in the name of the city.

(g)
For the purposes of this article, the decisions of the city will prevail in any instance in which there is a conflict between it and the health officer on any issue of sanitation, or lack of it, and its effect on human health or well-being.
