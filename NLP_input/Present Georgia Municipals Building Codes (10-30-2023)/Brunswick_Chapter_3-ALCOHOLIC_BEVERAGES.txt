For purposes of this subsection, the distance shall be measured from the main entrance of the proposed new licensed business to the nearest boundary of the residential parcel in question using the most direct method of travel using public sidewalks, streets, and other public rights-of-way.

(8)
The distance requirements found herein shall not apply to applications made on behalf of locations falling within the city's designated GC Core Zoning District.
(9)
A license shall not be considered a new license for purposes of this subsection, and thus the distance requirements set forth herein shall not apply, if it is a renewal of an existing license at an existing licensed location, or a change of owner at an existing licensed location, or the licensing of a business at a location if the sale of alcoholic beverages was lawful at such location at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding such application.
