Two or more photographs;
(2)
Two or more microphotographs;

Two or more digital images;

Traffic light signal violation monitoring system means a device adapted for use at a signalized intersection or crosswalk, working in conjunction with a traffic control signal or independently to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a red signal indication.
(b)
Offense. The following provisions shall be the traffic regulation for automated red light enforcement:
(1)
Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown by a steady circular green signal.
(2)
Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown by a steady green arrow signal indication.
(3)
The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a monetary penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such vehicle is found, as evidenced by information obtained from a traffic light signal violation monitoring system, to have failed to comply with a traffic light signal as designated in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section or violate any other traffic regulation specified in O.C.G.A. §§ 40-6-20 and 40-6-21.
(c)
Proof certificate. The following provisions shall be proof certification for automated red light violations:
(1)
Proof that a particular vehicle entered an intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section, as detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system, together with proof that the particular vehicle is registered with the state department of public safety (or any other state vehicle registration office) in the charged person's name, shall raise the evidentiary presumption and constitute prima facie evidence in any prosecution of a violation of that section that the charged person was the person driving the vehicle depicted in the recorded image.
(2)
A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a trained law enforcement officer or a technician employed by a law enforcement agency for which such device is authorized, based on inspection of recorded images produced by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.
(3)
Any recorded images detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation pursuant to this section.
(4)
Such presumption shall be rebutted if the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle files a notarized affidavit by regular mail with the clerk of the municipal court that such owner, lessee, or renter was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or testifies in open court under oath that such owner, lessee, or renter was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation.

Such presumption shall be rebutted if the charged person can provide evidence that he or she was not the registered owner of the vehicle at the time and date that the alleged violation occurred.

Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section in order to avoid impeding the efforts of an emergency vehicle to pass through the intersection.
(9)
Not withstanding any other provision of this section, if the recorded image detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the alleged violation with at least two recorded images thereof. Within ten days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide proof to the city of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time and location of the violation and within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with at least two recorded images of the alleged violation. After receipt by the city of the proof of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of subsection (b) of this section to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible as set forth in subsection (b) of this section.
(d)
Penalty; effect of a conviction. The following provisions shall be the penalty for automated red light violations:
(1)
Imposition of a penalty pursuant to this section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation and not as an operator and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall be equal to the fine issued by the city municipal court for disregarding a traffic device at the time of the alleged violation and shall not include court costs. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall double the amount of the fine issued by the city municipal court for disregarding a traffic device if the alleged violation occurs in a designated "School Zone," as defined by the state law.
(2)
Failure to pay the civil penalty or file an appeal within 30 days after notification of the violation shall result in an additional penalty. Every 30-day period thereafter shall result in another additional penalty. The amount of the additional penalties shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk.
(3)
The city may establish procedures for the collection of the civil penalties and may enforce the penalties by a civil action in the nature of a debt.
(e)
Summons. The following shall be the summons regulations for an automated red light violation:
(1)
A summons for a violation of this section may be executed by the city by mailing by first class mail a copy thereof to the address of the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle as shown, in the case of vehicle owners, in the records of the state department of public safety (or any other state vehicle registration office) or, in the case of vehicle lessees or renters, in the records of the lessor or renter.
(2)
No proceedings for contempt or arrest shall be instituted for failure to appear on the return date of the summons.
(f)
Private entities. A private entity may enter into an agreement with the city to be compensated for providing the traffic light signal violation monitoring system or equipment, and all related support services, to include consulting, operations and administration. However, only a trained law enforcement officer or a technician employed by a law enforcement agency for which such device is authorized, may swear to or affirm the certificate required by subsection (c) of this section.
