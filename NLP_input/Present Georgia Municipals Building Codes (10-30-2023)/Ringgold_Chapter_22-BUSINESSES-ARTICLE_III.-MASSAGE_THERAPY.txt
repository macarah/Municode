ARTICLE III. - MASSAGE THERAPY[3]

--- (3) ---
Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2013-0211, adopted Feb. 11, 2013, repealed the former art. III, §§ 22-81—22-97, and enacted a new art. III as set out herein. The former art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 06-0109-02, §§ I—XVII, adopted Jan. 9, 2006.

Sec. 22-81. - Findings.
The unlicensed practice of massage therapy has in certain contexts been associated with criminal behavior that damages the reputations of those who comply with the law as well as the communities in which these businesses operate. As a result, the general assembly has found it necessary to regulate massage therapy and to provide for education and state certification. (Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-1 et seq.)
Businesses operating massage parlors with massage being offered by unlicensed masseuses and businesses of like character are businesses that affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the communities in which they operate. Certain of these businesses have been associated with illegal sexual conduct, such as solicitation, pandering, pimping, prostitution, sodomy, lewdness, and other sexual conduct. (LA Times, 2/20/12; Houston Chronicle, 5/13/12; Cleveland Plain Dealer, 6/23/12; Sun Sentinel, 11/24/12). In order to protect the public interest, health, and welfare, it is necessary that such businesses be regulated to prevent their use for unlawful and illegal activities.
The City of Ringgold finds that it is in the best interest of health, welfare, safety, and morals; churches, schools, and parks; and the preservation of its businesses and neighborhoods to prevent the adverse impact of unlicensed massage practitioners and the parlors and businesses of like character wherein they practice illegal sexual activities for compensation. Therefore, the city finds that the prohibition of unlicensed massage practice, as well as the prohibition of dispensation and consumption of alcohol and escort dating services in connection with massage parlors, will improve the public welfare by furthering legitimate government interests, such as reducing criminal activity, protection against devaluation and deterioration of properties located nearby, and eliminating undesirable community conditions normally associated with parlors that have masseuses who are not licensed pursuant to the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act, and that such prohibition will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
