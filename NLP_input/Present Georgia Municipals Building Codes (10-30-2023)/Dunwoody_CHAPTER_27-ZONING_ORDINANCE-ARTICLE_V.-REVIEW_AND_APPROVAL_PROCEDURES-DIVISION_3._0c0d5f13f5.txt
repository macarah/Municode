(2)
Whether the proposed use complies with the requirements of this zoning ordinance;
(3)
Whether the proposed site provides adequate land area for the proposed use, including provision of all required open space, off-street parking and all other applicable requirements of the subject zoning district;
(4)
Whether the proposed use is compatible with adjacent properties and land uses, including consideration of:
a.
Whether the proposed use will create adverse impacts upon any adjoining land use by reason of noise, smoke, odor, dust or vibration generated by the proposed use;
b.
Whether the proposed use will create adverse impacts upon any adjoining land use by reason of the hours of operation of the proposed use;
c.
Whether the proposed use will create adverse impacts upon any adjoining land use by reason of the manner of operation of the proposed use;
d.
Whether the proposed use will create adverse impacts upon any adjoining land use by reason of the character of vehicles or the volume of traffic generated by the proposed use;
e.
Whether the size, scale and massing of proposed buildings are appropriate in relation to the size of the subject property and in relation to the size, scale and massing of adjacent and nearby lots and buildings; and
f.
Whether the proposed plan will adversely affect historic buildings, sites, districts, or archaeological resources.
(5)
Whether public services, public facilities and utilities—including motorized and nonmotorized transportation facilities—are adequate to serve the proposed use;

(7)
Whether adequate provision has been made for refuse and service areas; and

In reviewing and taking action on special land use permit requests for major exceptions to Perimeter Center Overlay and Perimeter Center zoning district regulations, review and decision-making bodies must consider the following three criteria:
(1)
Whether the major exception request, if granted, will result in development that is inconsistent with the stated intent of the regulations;

(3)
Whether any negative impacts resulting from the granting of the major exception will be mitigated to the maximum practical extent.
