ARTICLE XI. - VACANT OR FORCLOSED PROPERTY

Sec. 5-206. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Port Wentworth Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 12-25, § 1, 9-27-12)
Sec. 5-207. - Findings and intent.
(a)
The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners.
(b)
Due to a lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are vacant, foreclosed, or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted.
(c)
Improperly maintained and secured vacant and foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of the vacant or foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article.
(d)
The foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with the applicable provisions of the municipal code of the City of Port Wentworth, Georgia.
