ARTICLE V. - LOT AND BLOCK STANDARDS

Sec. 26-144. - Lots.
Lots should be designed generally such that they are no more than four times as deep as they are wide at the building setback line. For lots which include unusual building sites due to easement configuration, possible floodplain encroachment, stormwater detention facilities, zoning imposed buffers, and/or unusual or severe topographic features, the city may require a final plat notation requiring an approved site plan prior to issuance of a building permit. All lots shall conform to the requirements of the city's zoning ordinance.
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § 6.1, 7-9-2002)
Sec. 26-145. - Side lot lines.
Side lot lines should generally be at right angles or radial to street rights-of-way. In cul-de-sacs, side lot lines should be radial to the center point of the cul-de-sac. When a more efficient use of the land relative to topographic conditions or improved building sites can be achieved by a reasonable lot pattern which does not fully adhere to the desirable side lot line configuration defined in this section, the mayor and council will allow the alternate lot pattern unless specific objections are noted.
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § 6.2, 7-9-2002)
Sec. 26-146. - Corner lots.
Corner lots shall have extra width to permit prescribed setback limits from all streets on which the lot has frontage.
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § 6.3, 7-9-2002)
Sec. 26-147. - Double frontage lots.
(a)
Double frontage lots other than corner lots shall be required for residential subdivisions along arterial or primary collector streets where internal access can be provided. When approved by the mayor and council, double frontage lots can be used to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation and/or property size. Otherwise, double frontage lots other than corner lots shall be prohibited.
(b)
To properly separate residential subdivisions employing double frontage lots from traffic arteries, the mayor and council shall require a planted buffer of 25-foot minimum width along the lot line abutting the traffic artery. The easement for the buffer will be required to deny right of access to the lot on which it is located.
(Ord. No. 2002-02, § 6.4, 7-9-2002)
Sec. 26-148. - Blocks.
(a)
The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to:
(1)
Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
(2)
Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions.
(3)
Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
(4)
Limitations and opportunities topography.
(b)
The planning commission may, when existing or proposed pedestrian/bicycle circulation patterns or public gathering places so justify, require pedestrian/bicycle ways or access easements through blocks.
