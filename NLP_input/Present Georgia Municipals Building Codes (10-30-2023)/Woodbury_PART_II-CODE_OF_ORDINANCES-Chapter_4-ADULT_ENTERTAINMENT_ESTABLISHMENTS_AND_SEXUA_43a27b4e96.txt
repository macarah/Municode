ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 4-1. - Findings and public purpose.
(a)
The mayor and city council, based on common knowledge and the experience of other local governmental jurisdictions in this state and elsewhere in the nation, all as evidenced by the testimony, reports and studies considered by the mayor and council in conjunction with and prior to the decision to regulate as outlined herein, which experiences are deemed to be relevant to the problems faced by the city, do hereby note and recognize the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our nation.
(b)
Further, it is the finding of the mayor and council that the operation of sexually oriented businesses, adult entertainment establishments and erotic dance establishments under certain circumstances, particularly under those circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal and other behavior and tends to create or encourage undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of behavior identified with such businesses include disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and controlled substance abuse. Undesirable community conditions identified with sexually oriented businesses are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for and allocation of law enforcement personnel reasonably necessary and desirable for the appropriate preservation of law and order, an increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of such criminal behavior and activities and acceleration of community blight by concentration of establishments in particular areas. This finding is made only after extensive study, review and consideration of the secondary effects of such establishments by reference to the past testimony of local officials and numerous studies, all of which are on file in the office of the city clerk.
(c)
Therefore, as limitation and regulation of such conduct and establishments is a matter of public welfare and governmental interest and concern, to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with such establishments, the ordinance from which this chapter is derived is hereby adopted.
