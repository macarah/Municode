  (c)
Ambient air concentrations shall be determined by using appropriate environmental protection agency dispersion modeling procedures or other methods specified by the planning commission. Ambient air concentrations are to be evaluated for annual period over a calendar year, twenty-four-hour periods from midnight to midnight, for one-hour periods beginning on the hour, and for thirty-minute periods beginning on the hour thirty (30) minutes after the hour. The identification of each toxic air pollutant emitted and its corresponding emission rate shall be determined using mass balancing analysis, source testing, or other methods acceptable to the planning commission.
(d)
For principal use incinerator facilities the emissions of hydrogen chloride shall not exceed four (4) pounds per hour unless the emission is reduced by at least ninety-nine (99) percent by weight and mercury shall not exceed one (1) pound per twenty-four-hour-period.
(e)
Special requirements for principal use biomedical incineration facility:
(1)
No person shall operate a principal use biomedical incineration facility unless:
a.
The dioxin emissions have been reduced by ninety-nine (99) percent or more of the uncontrolled emissions;
b.
The dioxin emissions have been reduced to ten (10) nanograms or less per kilogram of waste burned.
(2)
For the purposes of demonstrating compliance with this paragraph, the owner or operator of a principal use biomedical waste incineration facility shall conduct a minimum of two (2) annual source tests for the dioxins stack emissions using test method approved by the State of California Air Resources Board and a minimum of three (3) sampling runs shall be conducted for the method. Annual source tests shall be conducted until at least two (2) consecutive tests demonstrate compliance, at which time the frequency of future source tests is at the discretion of the planning commission. For purposes of determining compliance with subparagraph (1)a. of this rule, emissions shall be sampled simultaneously from the flue at the location where all the combustion is complete, but prior to the control equipment, and from the stack during source testing. For the purpose of determining compliance with subparagraph (1)b. of this rule, the source testing shall be conducted at the stack. The information regarding the composition (moisture content, and the amount of the total waste that is infectious, pathological, hazardous, or radioactive) and feed rate of the fuel charge during the source test shall be provided with the test results. The planning commission can require additional necessary information regarding the composition of the waste. Source testing shall be conducted at the maximum waste firing capacity (plus or minus ten (10) percent) allowed by the permit. A copy of all source test results conducted for purpose of demonstrating compliance with this rule shall be provided to the planning commission. The planning commission may in its discretion prescribe the testing company performing such test and may prescribe the time for performance of the test without advance notice to the owner or operator.
(3)
No person shall operate a principal use medical waste incinerator unless such individual who operates or maintains the incinerator obtains a certificate of training in medical waste incinerators issued by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers within nine (9) months of the commencement of the training program. Copies of the training certificates for the operators and maintenance engineers shall be submitted to the planning commission and shall be available for inspection at the facility along with the permit to operate.

Sec. 21-79. - Special procedures for transportation and handling of biomedical waste.
No biomedical waste shall, for purposes of disposal in the City of Cartersville, be transported into the City of Cartersville or from place to place within the City of Cartersville except under the following conditions:
(1)
All transports shall be in refrigerated trucks maintaining a temperature of not more than forty (40) degrees Fahrenheit.
(2)
All trucks transporting medical waste shall be used exclusively for the transport of medical waste and each truck shall have placed upon it at a prominent location a sign reading as follows: "Medical Waste Only - Not for Transportation of Other Materials." Such sign shall be in bright yellow letters readily discerned from a distance of one hundred (100) feet.
(3)
All biomedical waste shall be transported in leak-proof, puncture-proof boxes of the following specifications:
Die cut body with lid attached. Blank sheet size 62⅞ × 74 finished product size—Inside dimensions—18×18×23 board—400 double wall B/C flute, board combination 69/40/69/40/69 wet strength medium, water proof adhesive. Board to be curtain coated with wax on both sides. All mediums to be wax impregnated. Box must have leakproof corners. Box will be self-locking outer liner of box to be of oyster white linerboard. Box to be printed four (4) panels, one (1) color. Print to include appropriate information on the contents and handling of the materials contained in carton.
Liner for above carton. Blank size—39 13/16 × 74⅝ No joint scored sheet to fit above carton to further insure that it is leakproof. Board—400 double wall B/C flute, board combination 69/40/69/40/69 wet strength medium, water proof adhesive. Board to be curtain coated with wax on both sides. All mediums to be wax impregnated.
(4)
No biomedical waste shall be transported for purposes of disposal into City of Cartersville, Georgia, in plastic bags having colorants which contain cadmium, arsenic, mercury, antimony, lead or selenium. The planning commission may require random samplings of plastic bag material from any principal use medical incinerator facility to assure compliance with this section.
