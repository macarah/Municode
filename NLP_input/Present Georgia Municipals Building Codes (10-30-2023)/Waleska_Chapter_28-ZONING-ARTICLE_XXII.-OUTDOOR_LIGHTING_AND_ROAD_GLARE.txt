ARTICLE XXII. - OUTDOOR LIGHTING AND ROAD GLARE

Sec. 28-714. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of this article are as follows:
(1)
To encourage systematic practices in the use of outdoor electrically powered luminaries, consistent with conserving energy and maximizing the benefits to the citizenry;
(2)
To increase nighttime utility, safety, security, and productivity; to foster the nighttime use of property; and to protect the privacy of residents;
(3)
To reduce light trespass, obtrusive light, and sky glow, and to reduce roadway glare and extreme variations of illumination, to which elderly drivers are particularly sensitive;
(4)
To preserve and enhance the natural nighttime visual environment of the city;
(5)
To preserve the views of the starry sky, encouraging the enjoyment of their aesthetics, the education of the public in the sciences, and the astronomical study of celestial bodies; and
(6)
To accomplish these purposes by limiting illuminance levels; by directing the luminaire emissions away from roadways, other properties, and the sky; and by reducing illumination levels during later hours of the night.
Sec. 28-715. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Beacon means a light with one or more beams directed into the atmosphere or directed at one or more points not on the same property as the light source; also any light system with one or more beams that rotate or move.
Cutoff means a luminaire light distribution where the emission does not exceed 2.5 percent of the lamp lumens at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and does not exceed ten percent at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir. These emission values apply to all lateral angles around the installed luminaire.
Footcandle means a unit of measure for illuminance on a surface that is everywhere one foot from a point source of light of one candle, and equal to one lumen per square foot of area.
Full cutoff means a luminaire light distribution where zero emission occurs at all angles of 90 degrees or greater above nadir, and the emission does not exceed ten percent of total lamp lumens at a vertical angle or 80 degrees above nadir. These emission values apply to all lateral angles around the installed luminaire.
Glare means the sensation produced within the visual field by luminance that is sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted, causing annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility.
Illuminance means the quantity of light arriving at a surface divided by the area of the illuminated surface, measured in footcandles.
(1)
Horizontal illuminance applies to a horizontal surface; vertical illuminance applies to a vertical surface.
(2)
Average illuminance is the level of illuminance over an entire illuminated target area.
(3)
Maximum illuminance is the highest level of illuminance on any point within the entire area.
(4)
Minimum illuminance is the lowest level of illuminance on any point within the entire area.
Illuminance level. All illuminance levels and footcandles noted in this article mean the maintained illuminance levels: the illuminance levels occurring just prior to lamp replacement and luminaire cleaning. The average illuminance level applies to an entire illuminated target area. Minimum and maximum illuminance levels apply to small areas within the entire illuminated target area. Unless otherwise noted, illuminance levels refer to horizontal illuminance levels.
Lamp means the component of an outdoor luminaire that produces light.
Light trespass means unwanted light emitted beyond the boundaries of the property on which the luminaire is located, detrimentally affecting residents, vehicle operators and pedestrians, the natural environment, and astronomical observations.
Luminaire (light fixture) means a complete fixed or movable lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps and ballasting (when applicable) together with the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.
Person means any individual, tenant, lessee, owner, or any commercial entity, including, but not limited to, a firm, business, partnership, association, joint venture, corporation, or organization, whether commercial, religious, fraternal, social or otherwise, or any agent thereof.
Roadway lighting means lighting that is specifically intended to illuminate roadways for automobiles, excluding the lighting intended to illuminate roadways only for pedestrians.
Security lighting means continuous illumination of nonroadway territory when there is no minimal nighttime activity by authorized individuals.
Semi-cutoff means a luminaire light distribution where the emission does not numerically exceed five percent of the total at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and 20 percent at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir. These values apply to all lateral angles around the installed luminaire.
Shielded means provided with internal and/or external shields, top, and side visors, hoods, and internal louvers to limit glare, sky glow, and light trespass caused by emission from luminaires.
Sky glow means the brightening of the nighttime atmosphere by light emitted above the horizontal plane and by light reflected upward from illuminated surfaces, which reduces the visibility of astronomical objects.
Uniformity ratio means a higher level of illumination in relation to a lower level of illumination within a given target area. A value for either the maximum-to-minimum ratio or the average-to-minimum ratio may be required. For example, if the average-to-minimum uniformity ratio is 4:1 for the given target area, the lowest level of illuminance is no less than one divided by four (25 percent) of the average level of illuminance.
Sec. 28-716. - Light trespass.
(a)
All luminaires, except street lighting and those used on one- or two-family dwellings, shall be located, designed, fitted, aimed, shielded, installed, and maintained to limit illumination only to the target and to minimize light trespass. The designed illuminance for pavement or ground shall be provided by a luminaire installed closer than four times the luminaire height. Directional luminaires such as floodlights, wall pack lights, and spotlights shall be aimed so that the center of the beam is not more than 62 degrees above nadir. Directional luminaires shall be shielded as needed for minimizing misdirected light.
(b)
Vertical illumination from luminaires on any single property shall not exceed 0.1 footcandles at a height of three feet at a property line of a residential zoning district or a nature-preserve type park; and shall not exceed 0.5 footcandles at a property line of other types of property, except where a greater illumination at the property line is due to luminaires on that property.
Sec. 28-717. - Glare control on roadways.
(a)
Glare from luminaires. It shall be unlawful to place or maintain on private property any luminaire of such intensity or brilliance within the field of view of a driver so as to impair his vision upon the public roadway, or to interfere otherwise with the operation of a motor vehicle. Every reasonable effort shall be made to ensure that the brilliance of any luminaire less than ten degrees from a passenger car driver's line of sight; either along the roadway ahead or toward each traffic control device, sign, or signal; does not exceed the brilliance of a headlight on an oncoming passenger car whose extended centerline lies ten feet to the driver's left, when the car is between 60 and 100 feet from the driver, and when the lowermost distribution of light from the headlight is in use.
(b)
Reflected solar glare. No building of more than one story, on which glass constitutes more than one quarter of a side, shall be constructed, until the orientations for the glass have been selected which will avoid sunlight reflections within ten degrees of the driver's field of view upon any public roadway. The orientations for the glass shall account for the bearing and altitude angles of the sun at all times of day on all days of the year.
