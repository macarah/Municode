  (2)
Intersections. Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, but in no case at any angle of less than 75 degrees.
(3)
Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be allowed.
(4)
Additional width on existing streets. Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall be required to dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements.
(a)
The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
(b)
When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided.
(5)
Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets, designed to be permanently closed at one end, shall be no longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a radius at the outside of the right-of-way of at least 50 feet.
(6)
Access. The planning commission may control access to major streets by requiring all lots to face and have access only to other streets.
(7)
Coordinated street system. Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. Where it is deemed necessary by the planning commission, such temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround having a roadway diameter of at least 80 feet.
(8)
Private streets and reserve strips. There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision in the city. Every lot in a subdivision shall be served from a publicly-dedicated street. There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the city council under conditions approved by the planning commission.
(9)
Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named, shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate or be sufficiently similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix "street," "avenue," "boulevard," "drive," "place," or "court."
(10)
Tangents. A tangent at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves.
(11)
Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system of the subdivision shall extend existing streets in adjacent developments at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width set forth in this section.

Sec. B. - Blocks.
The length of blocks shall be not less than 400 feet and not more than 1,500 feet and of sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots except on major streets.
Sec. C. - Lots and lot lines.
All lots shall front upon a public street. Lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines.
(1)
Minimum size. Lots served by a public sewerage system shall meet the minimum requirements of the zoning district in which they are located but in no case shall they be less than 7,200 square feet in lot area or have a lot frontage of less than 60 feet. Lots not served by a public sewerage system shall be not less than 75 feet wide at the building line nor less than 15,000 square feet in area. Greater area may be required for private sewage disposal if factors of drainage, soil condition or other conditions are considered to be potential health problems. The planning commission may require data from percolation tests to be submitted as a basis for passing on subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage disposal.
(2)
Building setback lines. The minimum depth of building setback lines from the street shall not be less than 30 feet and, in the case of corner lots, 15 feet from the side street. However, if greater setbacks are required by the zoning ordinance of the city as now or hereafter adopted, these shall be provided.

ARTICLE IV. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT[2]

Sec. A. - Enforcing officer.
The provisions of this article shall be administered and enforced by the city engineer. The city engineer's duties shall include:
(1)
Receiving subdivision plats;
(2)
In cooperation with the planning commission, reviewing and approving subdivision plats;
(3)

Cross reference— Officers and employees, § 2-91 et seq.
Sec. B. - Procedure for plat approval.
The procedure for developing and obtaining approval of a subdivision plat consists of three separate steps. These are:
(1)
Preliminary approval. The developer shall prepare a preliminary plat as specified in this ordinance and obtain approval of it prior to the making of any street improvements or installation of utilities. Three copies of this plat shall be submitted to the city engineer at least ten days prior to the regular meeting date of the planning commission. Within 30 days after submission, the planning commission shall review the plat and indicate its approval, disapproval (listing reasons), or approval subject to listed modifications as a basis for the preparation of the final plat. Failure to act within 30 days shall be deemed approval of the preliminary plat unless the developer agrees to an extension of time. Approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse unless the final plat is submitted within one year from the date of preliminary approval. After action by the planning commission, copies of the preliminary plat shall be distributed as follows: developer—one copy; city engineer—one copy; planning commission—one copy.
(2)
Physical improvement of subdivision. After preliminary approval of the plat has been given by the planning commission, the developer may then proceed to grade the streets and install all improvements required by this ordinance and any other applicable city ordinance. In lieu of the completion of all improvements before submitting a final plat and requesting final approval by the planning commission, the developer may post with the city a bond or certified check, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it, providing for a securing to the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities within a period specified by the planning commission and expressed in the bond.
(3)
Final approval. The developer shall submit an original tracing drawn in black indelible drawing ink and three copies of the final plat of the subdivision, or that portion thereof to be recorded and developed, to the city engineer, who will check and certify that monuments and completion of (or payment for) improvements are satisfactory. Such plat shall be submitted not less than ten days prior to the regular meeting date of the planning commission. Within 30 days after submission, the planning commission shall review the final plat and approve or disapprove it (listing reasons for disapproval). Failure to act within 30 days will be deemed approval of the final plat unless the developer agrees to an extension of this time. The tracing with certifications shall be returned to the developer, plus one copy for filing with the clerk of the superior court of Peach County. The remaining two copies shall be retained, one by the city engineer and one by the planning commission.
Sec. C. - Enforcement provisions.
(1)
Penalties for transferring lots in unapproved subdivisions. The owner or agent of the owner of any land to be subdivided within the city who transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiate to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such land before such plat has been approved by the planning commission and recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Peach County shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transfer shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. The city, through its attorney or other designated official may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by appropriate action.
(2)
Erection of buildings. From and after March 16, 1961, no building permit shall be issued for and no building or other structure shall be erected on any lot within the city unless the street giving access to the lot upon which said building is proposed to be placed shall be accepted or opened as, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of, a public street prior to that time, or unless such street corresponds in its location and line with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by said planning commission or with a street located and accepted by the city. Any building erected in violation of this section shall be deemed an unlawful structure, and the city engineer, the building inspector, or city attorney or any other designated official of the city may bring appropriate action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed.
ARTICLE V. - AMENDMENTS

Sec. A. - Procedure.
This article may be amended from time to time, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendations. The planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit a report. If the planning commission fails to submit a report within the 30-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed amendment.
Sec. B. - Public hearing required.
Before enacting an amendment to this subdivision ordinance, the city council shall hold a public hearing thereon; at least 15 days' notice of the time and place of which shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
ARTICLE VI. - LEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS

Sec. A. - Conflict with other laws.
When the provisions of this article specify more restrictive standards than required by any other ordinance, the requirements of this ordinance shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other ordinance require more restrictive standards, the provisions of such ordinance shall govern.
Sec. B. - Validity.
Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
Sec. C. - Effective date.
This ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its adoption; the public welfare demanding it.
