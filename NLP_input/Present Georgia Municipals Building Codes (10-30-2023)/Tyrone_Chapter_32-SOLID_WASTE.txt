(Code 1984, § 4-2-21; Ord. No. 2014-11, § 1, 11-6-2014; Ord. No. 2019-03, § 1, 5-2-2019)
Sec. 32-3. - Evidence.
(a)
Whenever litter is thrown, deposited, dropped or dumped from any motor vehicle, boat, airplane, or other conveyance in violation of this chapter, it shall be prima facie evidence that the operator of the conveyance has violated this chapter.
(b)
Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, whenever any litter which is dumped, deposited, thrown or left on public or private property in violation of this chapter is discovered to contain any article, including, but not limited to, letters, bills, publications or other writing which display the name of the person thereon in such a manner as to indicate that the article belongs or belonged to such person, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that such person has violated this chapter.
(Code 1984, § 4-2-20)
Sec. 32-4. - Violations.
(a)
Notification of owner and/or tenant. Whenever it appears that any provision of this chapter is being violated, the town manager or his designee shall notify, in writing, the owner or occupant if different from the owner, or both, of the alleged violation. Such notice shall specify the violation involved, the corrective action needed, and shall state that if such corrective action is not completed within ten days, or such other time as the town may establish, a citation will be issued for violation of the chapter. Notice shall be by personal service or by certified mail. Any time periods provided in this chapter shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail or on the date of personal service. If the current whereabouts of the owner or occupant are unknown, or if service by certified mail cannot be effected, notice shall be mailed by first class mail to such person's last known address, if any, and a copy of the notice shall be posted on the premises.
(b)
Recovery of town expenses.
(1)
Upon conviction for a violation of this chapter, or upon the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the town manager or his designee may, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, cause the violation to be corrected by use of town equipment and employees. In the event the town does not have sufficient equipment and/or employees to perform the removal, the town manager, with approval of the mayor, may contract with outside forces for the removal of said violation. The cost to the town of removing any such violation shall be a lien against the property, and shall be placed on the tax records of the town and county, as provided herein.
(2)
If any of the conditions specified in this chapter are abated at town expense, the town shall assess a lien against the property for the cost hereinafter described.
(3)
A letter shall be mailed by the town to the owner of record by certified mail, return receipt requested, that states the town's intention to file a lien and states that the owner has 20 days from receipt of the letter to either reimburse the town the expense of abatement or file written objections to the reasonableness of the assessed cost. Should there be any objections to the reasonableness of the cost, the mayor shall hear and determine the validity of such objections. The decision of the mayor shall be final.
(4)
Upon final determination of the validity of the costs or on failure to file objections within 20 days, a lien shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court and recorded as other liens are recorded. A copy of the lien shall be kept in the office of the town clerk, and a copy shall also be filed with the tax commissioner of the county.
(5)
The actual direct cost of abating the conditions, together with the necessary expenses for preparing, filing, and recording the lien, including any legal expenses, shall be assessed against the property and shall be collected by the town clerk, and, if not collected, shall thereafter be subject to the penalties and interest to which ad valorem taxes would be subject, and collection thereof may be enforced as allowed by law.
(c)
Owner and occupant liable. Both the occupant and the owner of the premises shall be independently liable for compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and shall be independently responsible for violations thereof. Lease of the property of an owner which purports to transfer responsibility for this provision shall be ineffective in shielding the owner from responsibility under this provision, and such owner shall remain independently liable along with the occupant of the leased premises.
(d)
Failure to abate violation. The failure to abate the alleged violation as set forth in the written notice within the ten-day period or such other time as provided by the town manager or his designee, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The town shall issue a citation for such violation commanding the person to appear before the municipal court to answer said charge.
