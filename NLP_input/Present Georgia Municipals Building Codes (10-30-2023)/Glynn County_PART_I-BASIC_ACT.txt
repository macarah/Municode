For purposes of this Section:
(1)
The terms 'Tract,' 'Block,' and 'VTD' shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia;
(2)
The term 'Precinct' is synonymous with the term 'voting precinct' and means a geographical area designated by Article 7 of Chapter 2 or 3 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., within which all electors vote at one polling place;
(3)
Whenever the description of any commissioner district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of the city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia;
(4)
Precinct names and designations following VTD designations are included for convenience only; and in the event the description of any commissioner district contains a conflict between the geographical boundaries of any VTD and the boundaries of the following named precinct, the geographical boundary of the VTD as shown on the census maps for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia shall control;
(5)
Any part of Glynn County which is not included in any commissioner district described in this Section shall be included within that commissioner district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia; and
(6)
Any part of Glynn County which is described in this Section as being included in a particular commissioner district shall nevertheless not be included within such commissioner district if such part is not contiguous to such commissioner district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that commissioner district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia.
In addition there shall be two at-large positions on the Board of Commissioners which shall be designated At-Large Post 1 and At-Large Post 2.

(c)
The members of the Board of Commissioners of Glynn County who are in office on December 31, 1982, and whose terms expire on December 31, 1984, shall serve out the remainder of their terms. In order to preserve said terms, the members of the Board who are in office on December 31, 1984, and who are residents of Commissioner Districts 1, 2, and 5 are hereby designated the members from Commissioner Districts 1, 2, and 5, respectively. The At-Large member of the Board who is in office on December 31, 1984, is hereby designated the member from At-Large Post 2. At the 1982 general election, members of the Board from Commissioner Districts 3 and 4 and At-Large Post 1 shall be elected. The members elected at said election from Commissioner Districts 3 and 4 and the At-Large member elected to At-Large Post 1 shall serve four-year terms and until their successors are elected and qualified. Thereafter, members who are elected to succeed members of the Board of Commissioners of Glynn County shall be elected at the general election which is conducted in that year in which the members' respective terms of office expire, shall take office on the first day of January following their election, and shall serve for a term of four years and until their successors are duly elected and qualified."
