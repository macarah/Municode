PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent resolutions, general resolutions and ordinances of Hall County, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1991 Official Code, as supplemented through June 30, 1995, and resolutions, general resolutions and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners of Hall County, Georgia. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1991 Official Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent resolution, general resolution or ordinance included herein.
The titles of the Code have been conveniently arranged and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together have been included. A table listing the amendments and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Obvious misspellings, punctuation errors and errors in grammar have been corrected without notation. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.
Title, Chapter and Section Numbering System
The title, chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by periods. The first number is the title number, the second number is the chapter number, and the third number is the section number. To allow room for expansion, chapters and sections have been numbered in increments of ten. Therefore, if new material consisting of one section is enacted which would logically come between sections 10.30.120 and 10.30.130 it could be numbered as section 10.30.125. New chapters may be included in the same manner, or at the ends of titles.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, and their corresponding prefixes, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time:

CODE APPENDIX CDA:1
SPECIAL ACTS SA100:1
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1
SPECIAL ACTS INDEX SAi:1
CODE INDEX CDi:1
  Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This republication was under the direct supervision of Mary Grace Tavel, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Mark Lane, Commission Clerk and Communications Director, and William H. Blalock, Jr., County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of Hall County readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Whereas, the Board of Commissioners of Hall County desires to adopt a new Code entitled "The Official Code of Hall County, Georgia" published by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of titles 1 through 17, inclusive; and
Whereas, the Board of Commissioners of Hall County desires to adopt a uniform penalty provision for every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation adopted unless another penalty is expressly provided; and

Section 3 The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any resolution or ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent resolution or ordinance that is repealed by this resolution.
Section 4 Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory resolution or ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the Board of Commissioners of Hall County may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits.

This copy of The Official Code of Hall County, Georgia, shall be available for all persons desiring to examine the same and shall be considered The Official Code of Hall County, Georgia.
Section 8 It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or a portion of The Official Code of Hall County, Georgia, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with The Official Code of Hall County, Georgia, in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of Hall County, Georgia, to be misrepresented thereby.
