Editor's note— Res. No. 2011-04, adopted Jan. 18, 2011, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Ch. 51, §§ 51-1—51-15, was at the discretion of the editor. See also the Code Comparative Table.

Sec. 51-1. - General.
(a)
No telecommunications facility or tower shall be located, constructed, erected or operated within the unincorporated areas of Lumpkin County unless and until the facility or tower has been lawfully permitted in accordance with, and remains in compliance with these telecommunications towers and facilities rules and regulations of Lumpkin County, Georgia.
(b)
These regulations are designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of Lumpkin County, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications towers and facilities within unincorporated Lumpkin County so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of the citizens and property of Lumpkin County and to foster, through a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. These regulations shall not prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, the provision of personal wireless services.
(c)
These regulations shall provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities within unincorporated Lumpkin County; protect Lumpkin County's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae; maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the county; and maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers.
