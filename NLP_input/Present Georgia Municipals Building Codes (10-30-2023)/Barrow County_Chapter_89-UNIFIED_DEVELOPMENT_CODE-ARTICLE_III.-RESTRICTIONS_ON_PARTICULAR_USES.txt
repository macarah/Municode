Requirements. Agritourism may only be permitted upon the grant of a special use permit and in compliance with the following additional conditions:
(1)
Agritourism shall be associated with agricultural activity such as, but not limited to, farming, horticulture, and livestock rearing, and such agricultural activities shall be conducted on the same property as is being used for agritourism.
(2)
The minimum lot size of any property conducting agritourism shall be ten acres. Contiguous parcels under common ownership that together constitute the same farm may be counted toward this requirement. Barrow County makes no representation regarding any impact use of a property for agritourism may have on conservation use value assessment.
(3)
Any competition utilizing motorized vehicles shall not be permitted as an agritourism activity.
(4)
Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting overnight lodging as part of an agritourism use. To the extent a property is to be used for overnight lodging, all permitting requirements otherwise required by the Code shall apply.
(5)
A minimum 100-foot setback is required from all property lines for all activity areas, gathering spaces, patios, pavilions, or other structures, whether permanent or temporary, associated with agritourism, including parking. Where this Code provides for greater setbacks for specific uses or structures, such specific setbacks shall apply.
(6)
The regulations pertaining to noise set forth in section 58-4 shall apply to any property used for agritourism, but in no event shall sound levels at the boundaries of the property exceed the following limits:
a.
Long duration sound. For any sound lasting continuously for one second or more, maximum limits are: 60 dBA when adjacent to a residential district; 65 dBA when adjacent to a commercial district; and 75 when adjacent to an industrial district other than heavy industrial.
b.
Short duration sound. For any sound having a duration of less than one second, including impulsive sound (i.e., sound having an abrupt onset and rapid decay), the limit shall be 80 dBA at the property line when adjacent to a residential, commercial or industrial zoning district.
c.
Method of sound measurement. These sound levels are to be measured in decibels in accordance with the standards promulgated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and shall be made with a sound level meter using the (a-) weighting scale.
(7)
Amplified sound or music for outdoor activities shall be permitted only during the hours specified in the special use permit.
(8)
Lighting shall be established in such a way that adjacent properties and roadways are not adversely affected, and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent properties and roadways.
(9)
Hours of operation shall commence no earlier than 6:00 a.m. and cease by 10:00 p.m.
(10)
If located adjacent to any residential district or an AG district used for single-family dwellings, the minimum buffers required for the heavy industrial district as specified in Table 8.1 shall be required.
(11)
Tents and temporary structures associated with an agritourism use may be permitted on a property for a maximum of 30 consecutive days, no more than four times each calendar year.
(c)
Uses. All services, attractions, or products offered, including retail as part of an agritourism use, shall be related to and support such agricultural activities. Agritourism activities shall be permitted only where the board of commissioners has granted specific approval. An applicant proposing one or more of the following activities must specifically request approval by the board of commissioners of each activity:
a.
Cut your own/pick your own. A working farm that grows trees, fruits, vegetables, and/or nuts where sales are made directly to the public and where the customers may participate in the harvesting.
b.
Educational demonstrations. Demonstrations that teach the ability to create a product where raw materials are grown from a working farm.
c.
Farm retail sales. A working farm where products produced on the farm are sold directly to the public either from the main dwelling or from an accessory building of less than 1,000 square feet.
d.
Farm tours. Tours where visitors are shown working farm operations and are taught about farm processes.
e.
Fee fishing/hunting. Offering private property for fishing or hunting for a fee to the public or to private parties.
f.
Petting zoo. Area for visitors to interact one on one with animals.
g.
Seasonal events/activities. Seasonal events and activities, including, but not limited to hay rides, holiday lighting displays, Easter egg hunts, and corn mazes.
h.
Horseback riding. Lessons in riding to members of the public for pay. Also includes offering trails for horse owners to bring and ride their own stock. This does not include facilities open to the public to watch horses and riders train.
i.
Other uses specifically requested, provided that such uses meet the intent of this section and it is determined that there will be minimal impact to surrounding properties. However, nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting the short-term rental of a property, or the use of property as a special event venue. In order for a property used for agritourism to also be used as a special event venue or for short-term rental, separate applications for such special use of property must be submitted and approved.

DIVISION 4. - AIRPORT HAZARD OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 89-251. - Purpose of article.
The purpose of the Airport Hazard (AHO) Overlay District is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by assuring that development within areas impacted by airport operations is appropriately planned to mitigate the impact of such operations. Further, this overlay district is intended to prevent the establishment of air space obstructions in air approaches through height restrictions and other land use controls, as deemed essential to protect the public health, safety, and welfare consistent with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77.
This overlay district is intended to be applied to properties which lie within close proximity to the Barrow County Airport (WDR) where aircraft are likely to fly at relatively low elevations. This overlay district is further intended to identify noise zones which should be planned to regulate future airport encroachment by inappropriate land uses and to minimize the effects of airport noise. A map of the Airport Hazard Overlay District is provided as Exhibit "A" which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-252. - Airport Hazard Overlay (AHO) with subzones established.
The designated approach zones described below are areas on the ground that generally correspond to airspace imaginary surfaces above ground.
(a)
Approach Zone 1 (AZ1). The inner edge of AZ1 is 1,000 feet wide, perpendicular to the runway centerline, and located 200 feet from the threshold of Runway 31. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(b)
Approach Zone 2 (AZ2). The inner edge of AZ2 is 500 feet wide, perpendicular to the runway centerline, and located 200 feet from the threshold of runways 5, 23, and 13. AZ2 expands outward uniformly to a width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-253. - General regulations.
modified
(a)
Building permit.
(1)
Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a legal nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this division, or any amendments thereto, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
(2)
Applications for building permits within approach zones shall include a completed FAA obstruction evaluation / airport airspace analysis. FAA form 7460-01 must be submitted to the FAA to initiate the analysis and evaluate potential hazards to air navigation.
(b)
Airport noise; agreement and waiver of rights. All planning actions will require as a condition of approval that the applicant sign an agreement with Barrow County agreeing that airport noise is likely to increase in the future and that they waive all rights to file formal complaints about airport noise. The agreement shall be evidenced by an Affidavit of Facts Effecting Title recorded in the real estate records of Barrow County. Such Agreement shall at a minimum contain the following provisions:
(1)
Any building constructed within the Airport Hazard Overlay Zone should at a minimum meet the Georgia Power Good Cents insulation requirements to minimize aircraft noise in the building.
(2)
All deeds transferring property within the Airport Hazard Overlay Zone shall contain the following:
"This property is in an area in the Airport Hazard Overlay Zone and is subject to overflights using the Barrow County Airport. As a result, residents in the Airport Hazard Overlay Zone may be subject to some inconvenience, annoyance or discomfort arising from the noise of such operations. Residents of property near a public use airport should therefore be prepared to accept such inconvenience, annoyance, and discomfort from normal airport operations or growth in the amount of air traffic and covenant to a waiver of rights to complain about airport noise from normal operations."
Sec. 89-254 - Restrictions.
The following land use restrictions shall apply within airport Approach Zones in addition to those provisions stated for the underlying zoning district affected by the Airport Hazard Overlay Zone.
(a)
Types of land uses, restricted.

(Ord. of 10-13-2020)
Sec. 89-255 - Review criteria for special uses in the Airport Hazard Overlay Zone.
(a)
In evaluating and deciding any application for a special use permit in the Airport Overlay (AH) Overlay Zone, the approval authority shall apply the following review criteria:
(1)
Whether the proposed use is compatible in view of the use and development of the airport;
(2)
Whether the proposed use will adversely affect the airport and whether the airport will adversely affect the proposed use;
(3)
Whether permitted uses in the airport overlay zone are available and appropriate for the subject property;
(4)
Whether the proposed use will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools;
(5)
Whether the proposed use is in conformity with the policy and intent of the comprehensive plan; and
(6)
Other factors found to be relevant by the hearing authority for review of the proposed use.
(b)
The Barrow County Airport Authority shall be given an opportunity to review the planning and community development department staff report and to recommend in writing either approval or denial of the special use to the planning commission. The planning commission shall forward the airport authority's recommendation to the board of commissioners with the planning commission's recommendation. The airport authority's recommendation shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on the planning commission or on the board of commissioners.
