(Code 2003, § 4-401(1))
Sec. 2-275. - Operating budget.
(a)
Preparation. Budgeting is an essential element of the financial planning, control, and evaluation process of municipal government. The operating budget is the city's annual financial operating plan. The annual budget includes the operating departments of the general fund, special revenue fund, debt service fund, capital project fund, enterprise funds, and other approved funds that may be established as needed. The budget shall be prepared in accordance with division 3 of this article.
(b)
Proposed budget.
(1)
A proposed budget shall be prepared annually by the city manager with participation of all city departments consistent with provisions of the city Charter, this Code, and state budget laws.

The budget shall include:
a.
Revenues;
b.
Personnel costs;
c.
Operating and maintenance supply costs;
d.
General services costs; and
e.
Capital and other (non-capital) costs.
(c)
Planning. The city will utilize a decentralized budget process. All departments will be given an opportunity to participate in the budget process and submit funding requests to the city manager.
(d)
Reporting. Periodic financial reports will be prepared and distributed by the city manager to the department heads. These reports allow department heads to manage their budgets and enable the city manager to monitor and control the budget. Summary financial and budgetary reports should be presented by the city manager to the council monthly.
(e)
Control and accountability. Each department head is responsible for ensuring that his department expenditures do not exceed budgeted funds. Departments cannot exceed appropriations described in the budget. Failure to achieve budgetary control will be evaluated and investigated by the city manager.
(f)
Budget transfers. Contingent upon remaining within the confines of the total department budget, each department head has the authority to recommend budget transfers to the city manager. Funds within departmental budget line items can be transferred upon the recommendation of the department head and with approval of the city manager.
(Code 2003, § 4-401(2))
Sec. 2-276. - Capital budget policies and capital improvement plan.
(a)
Scope.
(1)
A capital projects plan will be developed and updated annually. A five-year capital improvement program will assist in the planning, acquisition, and financing of capital projects. A major capital project is generally defined as a non-recurring capital expenditure that has an expected useful life of more than ten years and an estimated total cost of $25,000.00 or more. Examples include park improvements, streetscapes, computer systems, trucks, loaders, and expansion of facilities.
(2)
Major capital projects will be budgeted in the capital improvement fund reflecting all available resources. With the involvement of responsible departments, the city manager will prepare the capital budget annually. The city's capital budget will be adopted with the operating budget.
(b)
Control. All capital expenditures must be approved as part of each department budget or in the capital improvement fund. Before committing to a capital improvement project, the city manager or his designee must verify fund availability.
(c)
Program planning.
(1)
The capital budget provides annual funding for long-term capital projects identified in the capital improvement program (CIP). During the annual budget process, each department submits its budget request including operating and capital needs. Upon review of the requests, major capital projects are placed in the capital improvements fund. Other capital outlay is placed in the department's operating budget. Capital outlay is generally defined as an individual item of excess of $5,000.00 with a life expectancy of more than two years but less than ten years.
(2)
Citywide capital improvements are assessed and prioritized based on the city's objectives and goals, the city's comprehensive work plan, and the city's strategic plan.
(d)
Timing. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the city manager or his designee will work with department heads to schedule the appropriate timing of capital purchases to ensure the availability of funds.
(e)
Reporting. Periodic financial reports will be provided to enable the city manager to monitor and control the capital budget and to enable the department heads to manage their capital budgets.
(Code 2003, § 4-401(3))
Sec. 2-277. - Debt.
(a)
Policy statement.
(1)
Debt results when one borrows from an individual or an institution. The borrower receives funds to acquire resources for current use with an obligation for repayment later. The debt from borrowing generally must be repaid with interest.
(2)
The City of Porterdale recognizes that to maintain flexibility in responding to changing service priorities, revenue inflows, and cost structures, a debt management strategy is required. The city strives to balance service demands and the amount of debt incurred. The city realizes that failure to meet the demands of growth may inhibit its continued economic viability, but also realizes that too much debt may have detrimental effects as well.
(3)
The goal of the city's debt policy is to maintain a sound fiscal position and to protect the credit rating of the city. When the City of Porterdale utilizes debt financing, it will ensure the debt is financed soundly and conservatively.
(b)
Conditions for using debt. Debt financing of capital improvements and equipment will be done only when one or more of the following four conditions exist:
(1)
When non-continuous projects (those not requiring continuous annual appropriations) are desired.
(2)
When it can be determined that future users will receive a benefit from the improvement.
(3)
When it is necessary to provide basic services to residents and taxpayers.
(4)
When total debt, including that issued by overlapping government entities, does not constitute an unreasonable burden to residents and taxpayers.
(c)
Sound financing of debt. When the city utilizes debt financing, it will ensure that the debt is soundly financed by:
(1)
Taking a prudent and cautious stance toward debt, incurring debt only when necessary;
(2)
Conservatively projecting the revenue sources that will be used to pay the debt;
(3)
Ensuring that the term of any long-term debt incurred by the city shall not exceed the expected useful life of the asset for which the debt is incurred and shall be limited to capital improvements only;
(4)
Determining that the benefits of the improvement exceed the costs, including interest costs;
(5)
Maintaining a debt service coverage ratio which ensures that combined debt service requirements will not exceed revenues pledged for the payment of debt;
(6)
Analyzing the impact of debt service on total annual fixed costs before bonded long-term debt is issued; and
(7)
Maintaining total debt service for general obligation debt that does not exceed ten percent of the net operating revenues. Net operating revenues are all general fund revenues available after accounting for transfers between other city funds.
(Code 2003, § 4-401(4))
Sec. 2-278. - Investments.
(a)
Scope. This section applies to all funds under the City of Porterdale's control; excluding the city's pension funds which are invested at the direction of the City of Porterdale Employees' Retirement System Board of Trustees.
(b)
Objectives. The following investment objectives shall be met with this policy:
(1)
Safety. Preservation of principal shall always be the foremost objective in any investment transaction involving city funds. Those investing funds on the city's behalf must first ensure that capital losses are avoided by limiting credit and interest risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issues or backer. Interest risk is the risk that market value portfolios will fall due to an increase in general interest rates.
(2)
Liquidity. The second objective shall be the maintenance of sufficient liquidity within the investment portfolio. The city's investment portfolio shall be structured such that securities mature at the time when cash is needed to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Additionally, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should maintain some securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity).
(3)
Return on investment. The third objective shall be the realization of competitive investment rates, relative to the risk being assumed. However, yield on the city's investment portfolio is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above.
(c)
Delegation of authority.
(1)
The overall management of the investment program is the responsibility of the city manager. Responsibility for the daily investment activities will be assigned by the city manager. The city manager may designate employees to assist with the management and implementation of the city's investment program. Responsibilities to fulfill this authority include: opening accounts with banks, brokers, and dealers; arranging for the safekeeping of securities; and executing necessary documents.
(2)
A system of internal controls over investments is established and approved by the city's independent auditors. The controls are designed to prevent losses of public funds arising from fraud, error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets, and/or imprudent action by staff and city officials. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided for under the terms of the policy.
(d)
Authorized investments.
(1)
All investment activity is required to be in compliance with O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 83, which establishes guidelines for local government investment procedures.
(2)
The City of Porterdale may invest funds subject to its control and jurisdiction in the following:
a.
Certificates of deposit (CD's) issued by banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Deposits in excess of FDIC coverage must be collateralized by securities with a market value equal to at least 110 percent of the deposit. Only those securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 can be pledged as collateral;
b.
Certificates of deposit (CD's) issued by savings and loans associations issued by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Deposits in excess of the FSLIC coverage must be collateralized by securities equal to at least 110 percent of the deposit. Only those securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 can be pledged as collateral;
c.
Obligations issued by the United States government;
d.
Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency;
e.
Obligation of any corporation of the United States government;
f.
Obligation of the State of Georgia or of other states;
g.
Obligation of other political subdivision of the State of Georgia;
h.
The local government investment pool of the State of Georgia managed by the state department of administrative services, fiscal division;
i.
Repurchase agreements (REPOs) issued by commercial banks insured by the FDIC and collateralized by securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 with a market value equal to at least 103 percent of the repurchase agreements' maturity value;
j.
Repurchase agreements (REPOs) issued by primary dealers supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and collateralized by securities described in O.C.G.A. § 50-17-59 with a market value of at least 103 percent of the repurchase agreements' maturity value; and
k.
Prime banker's acceptances.
(e)
Prudence.
(1)
The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the prudent person standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Under the prudent person standard, investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable revenue to be gained.
(2)
The city manager and all designees acting in accordance with written procedures, this investment policy, and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse development.
(f)
Diversification. The City of Porterdale agrees with the premise that diversification is an important component of portfolio security. Therefore, the city shall endeavor to maintain an adequate level of diversification among its investments. The city shall not be over invested in any one type of instrument or financial institution. No more than 25 percent of the total investment portfolio shall be placed with a single issuer. This limitation shall not apply to the local government investment pool or direct obligations of the United States government.
(g)
Maturities. To achieve the aforementioned objective of adequate liquidity within city's portfolio, the city shall attempt to match investment maturities with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the maximum maturity of any instrument in the city's portfolio may not exceed two years from the date of acquisition by the city. In order to preserve liquidity and to lessen market risk, not more then 25 percent of the total portfolio may mature more than one year beyond the date of calculation. The maturity of non-negotiable time deposits may not exceed one year.
(h)
Safekeeping and custody. All investment securities purchased by the City of Porterdale shall be delivered against payment and shall be held in a third-party safekeeping account by the trust department of a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The city manager, or his designee, shall be responsible for the selection of a financial institution for this purpose, as well as the execution of a written safekeeping agreement with the trustee.
(i)
Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process will refrain from personal business activity that would conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which would impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials will disclose to the city manager any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business with the city, and they will further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that would be related to the performance of the city's portfolio. Employees and investment officials will subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the city, particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales.
(j)
Relationships with banks and brokers. The City of Porterdale will select depositories through the city's banking services procurement process, including formal requests for proposals issued as needed. In selecting depositories, objective business criteria will be used. To the extent possible, preference will be given to depositories located within the City of Porterdale. The creditworthiness of the institutions will be a fundamental consideration.
(k)
Report on deposits and investments. Periodic investment reports will be submitted to the city manager. Reports should include the following: an average daily balance of investment in each investment category; a current portfolio yield for each investment type and for the portfolio as a whole; an average daily balance of uninvested collected funds; an average daily balance of uncollected funds; and a percent of available funds invested. The report shall also provide a list of investments and accrued interest as of the last day of the quarter.
(l)
Performance evaluation. The city manager, or his designees, will seek to achieve a market average rate of return on the city's portfolio. Given the special safety and liquidity needs of the city, the basis used to determine whether market yields are being achieved shall be the six-month treasury bill.
(Code 2003, § 4-401(6))
Sec. 2-279. - Grants.
(a)
Scope. The purpose of this section is to provide direction in the application, acceptance and administration of funds awarded through grants to the city from other local governments, the state or federal government, nonprofit agencies, philanthropic organizations and the private sector.
(b)
Application and acceptance of grants.
(1)
The city manager is given authority to make application for and accept grants that:
a.
Are expected to be $200,000.00 or less on an annual basis with no required city match;
b.
Are expected to be $100,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of 20 percent or less; or
c.
Are expected to be $50,000.00 or less on an annual basis with a required match of over 40 percent.
(2)
The city commission must approve the application of and acceptance of any grants in excess of the limits established in subsection (b)(1) of this section.
(3)
The city will assess the merits of a particular program as if it were funded with local tax dollars. Local tax dollars will not be used to make up for losses of intergovernmental aid without first reviewing the program and its merits as a budgetary increment. Therefore, no grant will be accepted that will incur management and reporting costs greater than the grant amount.
(c)
Grant administration.
(1)
Each department must notify the city clerk/treasurer upon acceptance of any grant. Prior to the receipt or expenditure of grant revenues, the city clerk/treasurer must be provided with the following information prior to receiving grant revenues or making purchases against the grant:
a.
Copy of grant application.
b.
Notification of grant award.
c.
Financial reporting and accounting requirements, including separate account codes and/or bank accounts.
d.
Schedule of grant payments.
(2)
Department is responsible for the management of its grant funds and periodic reporting.
(Code 2003, § 4-401(7))
Sec. 2-280. - Assets.
(a)
Fixed asset criteria.
(1)
A fixed asset is defined as a financial resource meeting all of the following criteria:
a.
It is tangible in nature.
b.
It has a useful life of greater than one year.
c.
It is not a repair part or supply item.
(2)
A fixed asset has a value equal to, or greater than, the capitalization threshold of $5,000.00. Keeping an accurate record of the city's fixed assets is important for a myriad of reasons. Some of the most important reasons that the city needs to keep a good record of fixed assets are: for financial statement information, for insurable values, for control and accountability, for maintenance scheduling and cost analysis, for estimating and accounting for depreciation, for preparation of capital and operating budgets, and for debt management.
(b)
General policy.
(1)
Department head. The department head is ultimately responsible for the proper recording, acquisition, transfer, and disposal of all assets within their department. City property may not be acquired, transferred, or disposed of without first providing proper documentation. A fixed asset information form must accompany each step.
(2)
Recording of fixed assets.
a.
Unless otherwise approved by the city clerk/treasurer, all recordable fixed assets must be recorded within 30 calendar days after receipt and acceptance of the asset. A fixed asset form must be attached to the purchase order before submitting request for payment. Assets will be capitalized at acquisition cost, including expenses incurred in preparing the asset for use. Donated assets shall be recorded at fair market value as determined by the department head. Fair market value may be defined as, but is not limited to, an average of documented prices for equivalent items from three separate vendors.
b.
The city will recognize acquisition costs based on individual unit prices. Assets should not be grouped. For example, in acquiring equipment, if three personal computers (PC) were acquired simultaneously at $2,000.00 each, this would not be an asset of $6,000.00 consisting of three PCs. Instead, it would be three separate acquisitions of $2,000.00. Each PC would be recorded as a separate controllable item.
c.
For equipment purchases, title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received. Similarly, for donated assets, title is considered to pass when the asset is available for the agency's use and when the agency assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset.
d.
Constructed assets are transferred from the construction in progress account to the related building, improvements other than buildings, or equipment accounts when they become operational. Constructed buildings, for example, are assumed to be operational when an authorization to occupy the building is issued, regardless of whether or not final payments have been made on all the construction contracts.
(3)
Acquisition of fixed assets. There are various methods by which assets can be acquired. The asset acquisition method determines the basis for valuing the asset. Fixed assets may be acquired in the following ways:
a.
New purchases.
b.
Donations.
c.
Transfers from other city departments.
d.
City surplus.
e.
Internal/external construction.
f.
Lease purchases.
g.
Trade-in.
h.
Forfeiture or condemnation.
(4)
Lease purchases.
a.
Assets may be lease-purchased through installment purchases (an agreement in which title passes to the department) or through lease financing arrangements (an agreement in which title may or may not pass).
b.
Departments considering a lease purchase for greater than $10,000.00 and other than from an established, city-approved contract must consult with the city manager.
(5)
Transfer of fixed assets. An asset transfer between departments usually represents the sale of an item by one department to another and may be treated as a new purchase. A transfer between related departments under the same control (police and fire, for example) may, if desired, be treated as a transfer rather than sale. That is, the asset is recorded under the new department with original acquired date and funding amount. A fixed asset form must be sent to the accounting department for all transfers.
(6)
Sale of fixed assets. Sale of fixed assets by a department must be to the highest, responsible bidder and must be conducted by sealed bid or by auction. The sale must be publicized in accordance with state laws.
(7)
Disposal of fixed assets.
a.
When an asset is disposed of, its value is removed from the financial balances reported and from inventory reports; however, the asset record, including disposal information, remains on the master file for three years, in the city clerk/treasurer's office, after which time it is purged from the system according to general accepted accounting principles. This preserves an audit trail for disposed items, and facilitates departmental comparisons between actual or historical useful life information with useful life guidelines. Such comparisons permit a more precise definition of an asset's useful life than those provided by the internal revenue service (IRS) or other guidelines initially used.
b.
A disposal action is appropriate only when certain conditions occur resulting in an asset no longer being in the possession of the agency. Assets no longer in use, which remain in the possession of the department, are considered surplus property and not a disposal.
c.
Fixed assets may be disposed of in any one of six ways:
1.
Sale or trade-in.
2.
Abandonment/retirement.
3.
Lost or stolen.
4.
Transfer.
5.
Cannibalization (taking parts and employing them for like uses within the department, such as is often the practice in computer or vehicle maintenance).
6.
Casualty loss.
d.
Only when the asset is no longer in possession of the department, due to one of the six reasons listed in subsection (b)(7)c of this section, is disposal action appropriate.
e.
Assets are abandoned or retired when there is no longer any use for them in the department, they are of no use to any other city department, they cannot be repaired, transferred, cannibalized, sold, or traded-in. Thus meaning that there is no safe and appropriate use for the abandoned goods to the city or for others.
f.
Stolen items must be reported to the police and a police report filed. A copy of this report must accompany the disposal record.
g.
Casualty losses must be documented within 24 hours of loss and reported to the city's administrative services director immediately for followup with the city's insurance carrier.
h.
Cannibalized items are considered surplus and are disposed of by noting cannibalization on the disposal record. Ideally, this method will allow departments to look at cannibalized items on the disposal report and assess what surplus parts may be available. Departments will send documentation of items cannibalized to the city clerk/treasurer's office, and all remaining costs and accumulated depreciation will be removed from appropriate asset accounts in the general fixed asset fund.
i.
All assets no longer in the possession of the department, due to one of these six qualifying conditions, and after submission of all appropriate documentation to the city clerk/treasurer's office, will be removed from the master departmental asset file and considered disposed.
j.
Department management is responsible for reviewing disposal reports, evaluating causes and trends leading to disposals, and implementing procedures to more effectively manage and control disposals when the dispositions represent problems, inefficiencies, and/or the incurrence of unnecessary cost.
k.
The sanitation and facilities administration department will not take city property for disposal without the accompaniment of proper documentation.
(8)
Physical inventory. An annual physical inventory of all fixed assets will be performed by the city clerk/treasurer's office. The inventory will be conducted with the least amount of interruption possible to the department's daily operation. A full report of the results of the inventory will be sent, within 30 days of completion, to all departments for verification and acceptance.
