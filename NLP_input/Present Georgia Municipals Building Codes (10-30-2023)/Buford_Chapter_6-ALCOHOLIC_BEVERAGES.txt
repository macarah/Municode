Any applicant or licensee who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final action of the city manager, or his designee, may have a review thereof by appeal to the zoning board of appeals. Such appeal shall be by written petition, filed in the office of the city manager within 15 days after the final order or action of the city manager and in order to defray administrative costs, must be accompanied by a filing fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk; except that the filing fee for appeals relating only to pouring permits for employees shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk.

The findings of the zoning board of appeals shall be forwarded to the city manager within 15 days after the conclusion of the hearing, and it shall be the duty of the city manager to notify the appellant of the action of the zoning board of appeals.
(f)
The findings of the zoning board of appeals shall not be set aside unless found to be contrary to law or ordinances, or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, or unreasonable.

Sec. 6-86. - Regulations as to employees and managers.
The following regulations apply to all establishments holding a license for consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises:
(1)
No person shall be employed to dispense, sell, serve, take orders, mix alcoholic beverages, or in any managerial position, by an establishment holding a license hereunder until such person has been fingerprinted or cleared by the city marshal, or his designee, indicating that the person is eligible for such permit.
(2)
This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of busboy, cook, or dishwasher.
(3)
No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city marshal, or his designee, and, upon paying a fee which shall be established by the city commission, and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order.
(4)
The city marshal, or his designee, shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted or cleared. If there is no record of a violation of this division, the city marshal or his designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the city marshal or his designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial, and their right to appeal.
(5)
No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the city marshal or his designee, that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually-related crime within a period of five years from the date of conviction and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first-time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, pled guilty, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five years from the date of conviction and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit. For purposes of this division, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the person who was allowed to avail himself of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.); except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the person violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentence in court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the person had previously been sentenced as a first offender.
(6)
An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection (11) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be in the possession of the employee while the pouring permit holder is working and available for inspection by members of the city marshal, or his designee, or the city manager's staff.
(7)
No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or covered up any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the police department for an alcoholic beverage pouring permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted.
(8)
All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the city marshal, or his designee, or the city manager, or his designee.
(9)
Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of the original date of issuance, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After 30 days of the original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted.
(10)
All permits issued under this section remain the property of the city marshal, or his designee, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the city marshal.
(11)
No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in his possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city marshal, or his designee, may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of its issue. Licensees are required by this division to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in his possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit.
(12)
It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the city marshal or his designee, the name of the establishment, the license number, and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December.

Sec. 6-87. - Open area and patio sales.
(a)
Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the city manager.
(b)
The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge.
(c)
The height of such structure shall be a minimum of 3½ feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. It must be permitted and approved by the city's building inspection department and the county's fire department as required by their governing regulations or codes.
(d)
The only exit from this type area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit (not for general public use unless an emergency exists). The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.
(e)
If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the city manager. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the city's development and fire codes.
(f)
Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel, provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention, or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. Patio areas, as that term is used in this section, do not have to conform to the standards in this section.

An establishment maintaining a consumption on the premises license located in the city's downtown district may sell individual alcoholic beverages for consumption to persons authorized to possess or consume alcoholic beverages in the downtown entertainment district.
(b)
It is prohibited for customers to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages unless such consumption takes place within the downtown entertainment district during hours and under the rules established herein.

Such area shall expressly exclude Jones Alley and the city parking deck.
(b)
Each eligible Main Street establishment possessing a consumption on the premises license shall register with the city a transparent plastic cup 16 ounces or less with a logo of the restaurant, single servings only. Such cup shall be approved by the city. During the provisional period, the city may approve an alternative cup design due to timing of delivery of logo cups. Alcoholic beverages shall only be sold and consumed in these containers.
(Ord. of 10-5-2020, § 6-75.1)
Sec. 6-90. - Provisional nature.
The city reserves the absolute right to revoke or suspend open container consumption within the downtown district. Said pilot or trial period is expected to last 90 to 120 days at which point the city will re-evaluate the same.
(Ord. of 10-5-2020, § 6-75.2)
Sec. 6-91. - Other business; nonapplicability.
Nothing herein shall be construed as to modify or lessen an individual establishment's right to disallow consumption on its premises or be forced to permit patrons with said containers.
(Ord. of 10-5-2020, § 6-75.3)
Sec. 6-92. - Solicitation prohibited.
No retail consumption dealers licensed under this division shall require, permit, suffer, encourage, or induce any employee or person to solicit in the licensed premises for herself/himself, or for any person other than the patron and guest of the patron, the purchase by the patron of any drink, whether alcoholic beverage or nonalcoholic beverage, or money with which to purchase such beverage; nor shall any licensee pay a commission or any other compensation to any person frequenting his establishment or to his agent or manager to solicit for herself/himself or for others the purchase by the patron of any drink, whether alcoholic beverage or nonalcoholic beverage, or money with which to purchase such beverage.

In eating establishments regularly serving prepared food, with a full-service kitchen (a full-service kitchen will consist of a three-compartment pot sink, a stove or grill permanently installed, and a refrigerator, all of which must be approved by the health and fire departments), regularly serving food every hour they are open and deriving at least as much gross receipts annually from the sale of prepared meals or food as it derives from the sale of distilled spirits; provided, however, that an eating establishment found to be out of compliance with the appropriate food/distilled spirits ratio, as set forth above, may be granted up to a six-month grace period at which time the respective sales shall be reexamined and any failure to achieve the appropriate ratio may result in suspension/revocation. Nothing herein shall be construed to waive any right of the city to pursue any action for suspension or revocation arising from noncompliance with the respective ratios. Such grace period shall not be provided more than one time in any three-year period.
(2)
In indoor commercial recreation establishments.
(3)
In an indoor publicly owned civic and cultural center capable of serving prepared food, with a full-service kitchen (a full-service kitchen will consist of three-compartment pot sink, a stove or grill permanently installed, and a refrigerator, all of which must be approved by the health and fire departments); prepared to serve food every hour they are open and deriving at least 70 percent of its total annual gross sales from the sale of prepared meals or foods and recreation activities.

If the applicant is denied a state license, the deposit representing the license fee shall be refunded; but such cost paid for investigation and administrative cost shall be retained. However, any person applying for more than one license shall pay only one fee to defray investigative and administrative expenses, which fee shall be the largest of the investigative and administrative fees authorized under this Code. Any applicant for a license under this division who has in existence at the time of making the new application an existing license under this division shall pay no investigative and administrative costs.
