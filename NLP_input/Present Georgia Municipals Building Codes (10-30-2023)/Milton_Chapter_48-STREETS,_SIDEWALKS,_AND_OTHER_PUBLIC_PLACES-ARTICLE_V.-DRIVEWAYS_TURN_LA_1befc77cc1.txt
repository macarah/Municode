Subdivision I. - In General

Sec. 48-380. - Purpose.
This division is intended to clearly define the process of constructing a legal access point or any other work in the right-of-way of city roads. To accomplish this we are modifying sections three through five of the state department of transportation document Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control and adopting this modified version. Any variance to the standards set forth in this manual must be in the form of a written appeal to the director of public works, along with the appropriate studies to support the variance request.

Sec. 48-381. - Spacing.
(a)
As drivers approach each intersection along a roadway, they are often presented with decisions and may be required to stop or make various maneuvers. When exiting the roadway, it is necessary to decelerate and, in some cases, to change lanes. It may also be necessary to adjust speeds in reaction to other vehicles entering into the arterial traffic stream. Driveways should be spaced so that drivers can perceive and react to the conditions at each intersection in succession. Spacing between driveways should be at least equal to the distance traveled at the posted speed limit during the normal perception and reaction time plus the distance traveled as the vehicle decelerates to a stop. Each intersection also requires a certain amount of storage space for vehicles waiting to enter. The distance between intersections should be great enough to provide this storage, allowing each intersection to have its functional boundary separated from those of the next intersection. Crash data also indicates that as the number of driveways along a roadway increases so do accident rates. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself, an indication that driveways will be allowed.
(b)
Guidelines for driveway spacing associated with the construction of new driveways are provided in Table 3-1. Driveways should be separated from any other facility, which accesses a city roadway, whether it is another driveway or a public/private street. Minimum spacing requirements also apply to driveways on the opposite side of undivided roadways. Requirements for the length of right and left turn lanes, as shown in Table 11 and Table 13, may increase the minimum allowable spacing shown in Table 1.

(c)
Spacing of one-way driveways.
(1)
Figure 1 shows a typical layout of one-way driveways. The spacing criteria presented in Table 1 does not apply to the distance between the two one-way driveways (driveway pair-a driveway pair is defined as a single driveway with a separated one-way in and one-way out drive lane configuration).
(2)
A driveway pair must be separated from another driveway pair by the distance as shown in Table 1. A driveway pair must also be separated from an adjacent two-way driveway in accordance with the spacing criteria in Table 1.
Figure 1: Spacing Criteria for One-Way Driveways.

Sec. 48-382. - Placement.
(a)
Not only must driveways be spaced from other driveways as provided in section 48-381, they must also be located a minimum distance from the property line. The radius return must be a minimum of five feet from the property line. This may be waived if a safety concern exists.
(b)
When driveways are to be jointly used by two or more property owners, the property line separation requirements given in subsection (a) of this section can be waived. However, a joint use agreement signed by the affected property owners must be provided to the transportation engineer. Either property owner may apply for the driveway permit.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-383. - Driveway spacing.
Driveways should align with other driveways located on the opposite side of the roadway. If offset driveways cannot be avoided, the same driveway spacing criteria as given in Table 1 should be provided to provide space for left turns. Figure 2 shows how the spacing is measured for locating offset driveways on undivided roadways. Spacing is from center-to-center.
Figure 2: Spacing of Offset Driveways.
If the city roadway involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover, the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway located on the same side of the roadway as shown above in Figure 2.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-383A. - Placement of interior driveways.
The placement of the first interior driveway which intersects the driveway from the city road should be as far as possible from the city road for safe and efficient operation. For non-single family, residential detached developments, the distance between the roadway traffic and the first internal movement shall be a minimum of 100 feet. Where the lot depth is not sufficient to meet the minimum requirement the minimum distance shall be equal to the maximum anticipated queing length for the proposed land use.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-384. - Residential driveways.
(a)
Driveways serving single-family residential homes or townhouses do not have to adhere to the standards set forth in the previous sections, as they have a less significant impact than a new street or commercial driveway. Not more than two private curb cuts may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling. When there are two curb cuts on any one street frontage, there shall be a safety zone between the cuts not less than ten feet, as measured along the curbline from the radius return. In no case shall the radius return be less than five feet from the side property line as measured along the right-of-way line, unless approved by the public works department. The radius return shall not encroach upon the radius of the curb at a street corner.
(b)
Not more than one private curb cut may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling where the street is classified as a collector or higher order street. If a lot has access to more than one frontage, it may not have any private curb cuts on a street that is classified as a collector or higher order street. If both frontages are classified as collector or higher order streets, then the curb cut may be on the frontage with the lowest classification, or as designated by the public works department.

Other factors will also be considered, such as distance to other median openings, adjacent land use, expected traffic volumes, and the resulting volume of U-turns that are likely to occur without the median opening. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself, an indication that median openings will be allowed.

(b)
The spacing guidelines provided in subsection (a) of this section are indicative of conditions that normally offer better signal progression for arterial traffic flow. It is recognized that under certain conditions, better operation may result from the introduction of signals with less spacing if the alternative forces high volumes of traffic to an adjacent intersection.
(c)
When the applicant can show, through an alternatives analysis, that better operations can be achieved with less spacing, the department of public works may consider an exception to the provisions of Table 3.

Subdivision II. - Design Criteria

Sec. 48-406. - Compliance; purpose.
(a)
The design of driveways shall comply with the guidelines of AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Bridges, current edition. However, this division provides a summary of the minimum design constraints that will be checked during the plan review process.
(b)
The geometric design of an intersection is a collection of various elements such as radius, width, grade, angle of intersection, etc., that, in combination, provide for satisfactory operation of the vehicles that will use the intersection. Since the operating characteristics vary dramatically for different types of vehicles, the designer must first establish the design vehicle on which to base the driveway design. The designer should also check the final design to ensure the design vehicles can operate satisfactorily.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-407. - Design for trucks.
(a)
The design criteria given in this article has more stringent requirements for trucks. Even though the general use of such guidance would result in more desirable operations for all vehicles, it is neither practical nor necessary to design all facilities to accommodate trucks. The designer must use judgment in selecting the proper design vehicle.
(b)
When semitrailer combination trucks are expected to use the intersection on a regular basis and in numbers more than just an occasional vehicle, then the intersection should be designed to accommodate the truck movements. This includes most driveways designed for industrial use and many commercial driveways.
(c)
For commercial uses such as shopping centers, the preliminary site plan should indicate where heavy duty pavement would be provided to accommodate truck access to loading docks. Any driveway associated with access/egress for the loading docks should use the truck radii. Minor movement driveways, particularly those that allow only right turns will generally only be used by passenger cars.

Sec. 48-407A. - Connections to rural sections.
This section describes the requirements for connecting to city streets that do not have curb and gutter and where curb and gutter is not required for sidewalk or trail installation.
(1)
When ditches are constructed on the city right-of-way, the front slope should be no greater than 4:1. When the bottom of the ditch is between five feet and eight feet below the edge of pavement, the front slope can be increased to 3:1. When the ditch is greater than eight feet below the edge of pavement, the front slope can be increased to 2:1. In any case when the front slope is greater than 4:1 guardrail warrants should be applied.

Sec. 48-408. - Driveway width.
(a)
When traffic impact studies are required, the driveway shall be designed to provide the number of lanes recommended in the study. The findings within the study supersede the standards set forth in Table 4. Standard lane widths are 12 feet.
(b)
When the need for multiple lanes is not established from a traffic impact study, the minimum and maximum driveway widths are as set forth in Table 4.

Sec. 48-411. - Median crossover design.
(a)
GDOT guidelines are to be used. Driveways onto divided city roadways where full access is to be provided shall be designed in accordance with state department of transportation construction details for median crossovers. The detail has two types of designs (see Figure 3) that are applicable in different situations in the city. Type A median crossovers will not be permitted.
(b)
Type B. Type B median crossovers are required when the projected volume of the left turn movement exceeds 50 vehicles per hour per direction and when the median width is sufficient to offset the left turn lane from the adjacent through lane. This design provides better sight distance for vehicles in the left turn lane. This is important for unsignalized intersections and when unprotected turns are allowed at signalized intersections.
(c)
Type C.
(1)
Type C median crossovers are typically used in urban areas where the median width is limited to approximately 24 feet or less. With this type of crossover, it may be necessary to add pavement to the opposite edge in order to accommodate U-turns.
(2)
Table 7 illustrates the minimum pavement width that is required for vehicles to make U-turns. The required width is given for passenger cars and for WB-50 trucks. However, provisions for U-turns at median openings are normally based on passenger cars.

Sec. 48-412. - Sight distance.
(a)
Driveways should be located to provide adequate sight distance. The minimum intersection sight distance criteria are provided in Table 8. The line of sight establishes the boundary of a sight triangle, within which there should be no sight obstruction. Any location where the sight line leaves the right-of-way, a permanent maintenance easement must be filed, and the area must be graded, landscaped, and kept free of objects such that sight distance is not compromised. The driver's eye should be located four feet off the centerline of the side street in the outbound lane. The object should be located at the center of the closest oncoming travel lane.

45 500 465 530 500 565
  Table 8: Intersection Sight Distance Requirements.
The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stop-controlled approach to the county roadway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed.
(b)
The sight distances given in Table 8 are for undivided roadways. If the roadway is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, chapter 9, intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than three percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars.

Sec. 48-413. - Horizontal alignment.
In general, the horizontal alignment of driveways should be designed using a tangent section from the centerline of the county roadway and extending to the property line. Horizontal curves should be sufficient to provide safe operations at speeds that would normally occur in the areas where they are constructed.
( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-414. - Angle of intersection.
(a)
Intersecting driveways and roads should generally meet at or nearly at right angles. Driveways and roads intersecting at acute angles create sight limitations that should be avoided.
(b)
In some cases, a more suitable overall design can be achieved by allowing intersecting angles other than 90 degrees. The following Table 9 gives the minimum angle of intersection that will generally be allowed for driveways designed to accommodate two-way traffic flow.

(a)
When any auxiliary turn lane that extends beyond the applicant property frontage, the applicant will be responsible for acquiring the necessary rights-of-way and easements in order to accomplish the necessary frontage improvements.
(b)
Except where necessary to control traffic, drainage or where necessary for the construction of sidewalk and trails, the use of barrier curbs on external roadways should be avoided for safety, and simplicity.

Sec. 48-417. - Minimum requirements for deceleration lanes.
(a)
The provisions of this section shall generally apply to auxiliary lanes installed on the approach to an intersection that provide for deceleration and storage of vehicles waiting to turn right or left. Such lanes are always beneficial and will be required in conjunction with driveway permits when projected traffic volumes exceed minimum levels as provided in the following sections.
(b)
Right turn deceleration lanes must be constructed at no cost to the city if right turning volumes (RTV), based on ITE Trip Generation (assuming a reasonable distribution of entry volumes as approved by the city transportation engineer) meet or exceed the values shown in Table 10. Passing lane sections fall under the criteria for two or more lanes.

(c)
In the event the city traffic engineer feels that field conditions or other factors indicate that it would be in the city's best interest to waive the decel lane requirement, the city traffic engineer must document the recommendations. The recommendations shall be approved by the public works director and be attached to the permit. The city traffic engineer may also require the addition of a right turn lane, even when the conditions in Table 10 are not met, if roadway geometry or field conditions indicate that the safety of the traveling public would be improved. The recommendation must be documented and approved by the director of public works for inclusion with the permit.
(d)
The right-of-way for deceleration lanes must be dedicated in fee simple to the city for the city to maintain. A limited warranty deed is not acceptable when the right-of-way is donated to the city. When the construction of a deceleration lane is not required the right-of-way shall be dedicated to the city in sufficient width to allow for the future construction of the lane when conditions warrant.
(e)
The pavement specifications for deceleration lanes must be the Georgia DOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, except as approved by the public works director in cases where a lesser design may be acceptable or where a proposed project is expected to tie in.

Sec. 48-418. - Deceleration lane design.
(a)
This section provides the design guidelines that should be used to establish the lengths of turn lanes if they are required. Turn lanes should provide a full-width lane that is long enough to allow for vehicles to decelerate from the operating speed to a full stop in addition to the length of full-width lane that is needed to store vehicles waiting to turn. Table 11 contains guidelines for lengths of tapers and full-width turn lanes for deceleration right turn lanes.

When traffic studies are conducted, the length of full-width lane needed for storage should be determined. If the length of full-width storage is greater than the length of full-width storage shown in Table 11, the longer length should be provided.
(c)
At signalized intersections, the amount of storage for both right and left turns can be based on the number of vehicles arriving during 1.5 signal cycles.
(d)
For unsignalized intersections, a commonly used rule of thumb is that left turn storage should accommodate vehicles arriving during a two-minute period. Minimal storage is required for right turn lanes at unsignalized intersections.

( Ord. No. 16-07-278 , § 1, 7-11-2016)
Sec. 48-420. - Left turn lane design.
(a)
The design of left turn lanes should consider the intended function and the characteristics of the roadway. In many cases, it is necessary to widen the existing roadway to introduce the left turn lane. All vehicles approaching the turn lane are shifted to the right. The left turning traffic is then shifted back into the lane. Through traffic is returned to its original lane beyond the intersection. When the roadway has a median that is at least 20 feet wide, the left turn lane can be developed out of the median, avoiding the need for transitions. If a proposed driveway aligns across the main street with another driveway, and the proposed driveway must provide a left turn lane and left turn storage, then adequate storage and tapers must also be provided for the driveway across the main street.
(b)
The basic design elements of left turn lanes are illustrated in Table 13. This example shows symmetrical widening, which basically requires the through traffic on each side to shift by one-half of the lane width. Some circumstances may dictate that all widening be achieved on one side, which requires a full lane shift for through traffic on the side where the additional width is developed. Table 13 provides guidelines for selecting the proper length of approach taper.

The example shown in Table 13 has straight-line tapers. These are acceptable but other designs may also be used, including the following: partial tangent tapers, symmetrical reverse curve, and asymmetrical reverse curve. See latest edition of AASHTO green book for details.
(d)
The required length of full-width storage is based on the peak hour traffic volumes. This should be determined in the traffic study. The amount of storage is dependent on the type of traffic control in effect. For signalized intersections, the storage should be sufficient to accommodate the 95th percentile peak hour queue. At yield-controlled intersections, the storage is based on the number of vehicles as designated in Table 14.

Sec. 48-421. - Raised islands.
(a)
Islands are an important form of intersection channelization that is often needed to prohibit undesirable movements, define the paths of allowed movements, and provide a refuge area for pedestrians. Any location where two outbound lanes are proposed for a driveway at an unsignalized location, the right line must be for right-out only movement, and separated from the other lane by a raised island.
(b)
Painted lines are an effective means to direct the paths of vehicular movement. However, raised islands are more effective during times when visibility is reduced. When islands are to serve as pedestrian refuge areas, they should be constructed as raised islands. All sign posts to be placed within concrete area must have hole through pavement structure. The hole may be either formed, drilled or sawed.
(c)
Raised islands should be large enough to command attention and accommodate wheelchairs. The smallest raised island should have an area of 50 square feet in urban areas and 75 square feet in rural areas. However, 100 square feet is desirable in both cases. (Refer to the revised ADA standards).
(d)
When multiple crosswalks are required to pass through islands, the required size may exceed the 100 square feet mentioned in subsection (c) of this section. The additional area may be required to install wheelchair ramps. As an alternate to ramps, the pedestrian travel way can be "slotted" through the island, remaining on the grade of the roadway.
(e)
Figure 4 shows a typical design for a raised corner island at a two-lane driveway. This design uses a radius of 65 feet and provides an island of sufficient size for wheelchair ramps and level landings.
(f)
Figure 4 also contains a median island along the driveway. This drawing does not imply that median islands or corner islands are required for all driveways. However, large painted islands may not serve the intended channelization purpose and the type island to be used should be based on the actual circumstances of the site.
(g)
Raised islands should be offset from the edge of the adjacent travel lane on all sides. The amount of offset shall be a minimum of 18 inches as measured from the edge of the travel lane to the face of the curb. When raised islands are adjacent to roadways with posted speed limits of 50 mph or greater, the island shall be offset from the edge of the roadway by a minimum distance of ten feet.

Sec. 48-422. - Right-in, right-out driveways.
Raised islands are also typically used to channelize the movements at a driveway where only right turns are allowed. The raised island is an effective means of preventing left turns. All right-in, right-out islands must have a radius that is 70 feet, or a compound curve that approximates 70 feet. Right-in, right-out driveways are not intended for truck traffic, so the exit and entrance lanes must be 12 feet in width as measured from face of curb to face of curb. The island must be constructed from mountable curb (three inches vertical, 45-degree face, three inches flat) to accommodate emergency vehicles. The edge of the island should be offset 24 inches to 48 inches from the edge of the travel lane.

The pavement specification of auxiliary lanes on city roadways shall be the Georgia DOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, or as designated in city standards as directed by the city.
(b)
New developments are required to widen the road along their frontage to a uniform lane width of 12 feet. If the widened area is two feet or less in width, a concrete sub-base should be provided per the current standards. The developer must then either pave the entire width of the road, or mill to the centerline and pave to match the existing road. All new pavement installations shall be edge milled to create a smooth transition to and from the new surface. Any deviation from this standard requires a waiver from the public works director or his or her designee.

Sec. 48-424. - Pedestrian considerations.
(a)
When driveways are constructed in areas where pedestrian activity is not prohibited, the design should adequately provide for pedestrian movement and interaction with vehicular traffic. Pedestrian features that should be considered include sidewalks, crosswalks, traffic control features, and curb ramps are required. The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines must be utilized where pedestrian traffic is expected.
(b)
Figure 5 contains typical locations for curb cut ramps. Ramps are required at all pedestrian crosswalks where curb is constructed or replaced. The required crosswalk detail is also shown in Figure 5. See current GDOT Construction Details for the appropriate treatment.

Sec. 48-425. - Clear zone requirements.
(a)
Experience has shown that motorists occasionally run off the roadway and providing a traversable recovery area can lesson serious injury. AASHTO publishes a Roadside Design Guide that should be used as a reference when designing driveways.
(b)
Table 15 provides the clear zone distances as contained in the Roadside Design Guide. Driveways must be designed so that all areas within the roadway right-of-way have clear zones as defined in the following Table 15.
_____
Table 15: Clear Zone Distances (in feet from edge of traveled way).
Note— Clear zones may be limited to 30 feet.
Note— Fixed objects should not be present in the vicinity of the toe of these slopes. The width of the recovery zones should consider a number of factors including right-of-way availability, economic factors, safety needs, and accident history.
_____
(c)
All areas located within the clear zones should remain clear of obstructions such as bridge abutments, poles, trees, etc. If obstructions are unavoidable, the design should include appropriate protection such as break-away design, guardrail installation, safety end treatments on culverts, etc. The Roadway Design Guide includes a table for horizontal curve adjustments, where the clear zone correction factor is applied to the outside of curves only. Curves flatter than a 2,860-foot radius do not require an adjusted clear zone.

Sec. 48-426. - Right-of-way requirements.
(a)
In order to construct driveways, it is often necessary to construct improvements to the city roadway. These improvements may include the addition of auxiliary lanes along the city roadway such as a deceleration lane or left turn lane.
(b)
If sufficient right-of-way exists, improvements to the city roadway may be permitted without the requirement of additional rights-of-way. In urban sections, the right-of-way should be no closer than 14 feet from the face of curb along state routes and 11 feet from the face of curb along all city roads. In rural sections, the point located one-half way up the back slope should be on or within the right-of-way line. Sufficient right-of-way should be donated to the city for the deceleration lane/commercial driveway. Paving specifications to match existing pavement or better should be full-depth to the right-of-way line. Depths may be reduced, if field conditions warrant, as approved by the public works director and as recommended by the city traffic engineer.
(c)
If an additional right-of-way is required in order to construct the required improvements, the applicant must dedicate the right-of-way.
