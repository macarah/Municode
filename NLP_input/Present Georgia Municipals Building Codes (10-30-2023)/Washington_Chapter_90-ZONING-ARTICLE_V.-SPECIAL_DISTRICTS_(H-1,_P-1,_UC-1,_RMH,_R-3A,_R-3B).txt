DIVISION 8. - CD-1 RUSHER STREET REVITALIZATION DISTRICT[8]

Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— An Ord. of May 27, 2009, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 90-636 and 90-637. Inasmuch as §§ 90-636 and 90-637 currently exist in the Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 90-620 and 90-621.

Sec. 90-620. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose. The CD-1 Rusher Street revitalization district is a character district established to promote the renovation, rehabilitation and reuse of property in the vicinity of Washington's southwestern gateway. The district provides a design overlay for residential and nonresidential properties that promotes traditional parcel and building arrangements which are pedestrian-friendly and human in scale, fosters a lively mix of uses and generates interaction among neighbors. Building type standards incorporate traditional design elements that accentuate Washington's historic small-town character while allowing flexibility in how such components are applied to individual structures in order to allow for contemporary interpretations of historic building forms.
(b)
Guiding principles. The Rusher Street revitalization district provides the framework to implement the vision established in the Southwest Washington Urban Redevelopment Plan. To effectively implement the redevelopment plan vision, interpretation of the provisions of this division should be such that the following guiding principles are advanced:
(1)
The streetscape will be defined and framed by principal structures rather than parking or open areas.
(2)
As the district develops, building form, arrangement and scale across streets should be complimentary and provide consistent streetscape definition.
(3)
Underlying zoning districts shall be limited to those with uses in which the design provisions of this division can easily be interpreted and implemented.
(4)
Layout and design of public spaces, private property, buildings and structures provides for the architectural compatibility of residential and nonresidential structures with applicable historic districts in Washington.
(5)
New structures will be oriented toward the street and other public spaces, and to the rear of property — in order to provide visual security while subtly providing privacy to adjacent neighbors.
(6)
Openings and entries are oriented to encourage pedestrian activity and direct interaction toward the street space.
(7)
The boundaries of parcels will be defined — whether by building, structure, landscaping fencing or other buffering — but will done so in a manner that promotes visual interconnectivity rather than concealing activity or serving as barriers.
(8)
Areas for vehicle storage and movement — and services and utilities — shall be largely kept from the street space.
(c)
Base zoning districts. The Rusher Street revitalization district promotes the mixture of uses that would typically be found within a neighborhood setting. While the form of development within the district will result in areas which assume a more urban characteristic, the scale of development on individual parcels — particularly nonresidential development — will be limited. Uses that are regional in nature and/or require the compilation of large development tracts, or the construction of expansive buildings, parking or outdoor storage areas are not compatible with the guiding principles of the district. To reduce pressure for the development of property at a scale that is incompatible to the district, only specific underlying base zoning districts may be used in combination with the Rusher Street revitalization district.
(1)
Permitted base zoning districts—Major streets. The base zoning districts identified in Figure V-8-A may be used in conjunction with the Rusher Street revitalization district when the parcel and principal structure face an existing major street as identified in section 70-71, of the Code, or an existing or proposed avenue as identified in section 70-72 of the Code.

Permitted base zoning districts—Lots with multiple street frontages. The appropriateness of an underlying base zoning district consistent with the provisions of this subsection on a corner or through lot shall be determined by the mayor and city council on a case-by-case basis with due consideration given to the means of vehicular access to the site and the proposed orientation/location of the principal structure.
(d)
Land uses. The base zoning district for each parcel within the Rusher Street revitalization district identifies an applicable list of uses that may be developed by right, or following the review and approval of the planning commission. Within the Rusher Street revitalization district, permitted and conditional land uses identified by the base zoning district shall be classified in one of three manners:
(1)
Land uses prohibited. Land uses listed within Figure V-8-C shall be prohibited in the Rusher Street revitalization district even if typically allowed within the base zoning district.
(2)
Land uses subject to building type standards. Land uses listed within Figure V-8-D shall be permitted by right in the Rusher Street revitalization district subject to the provisions of this division.
(3)
Land uses subject to base zoning district. Land uses not listed in Figure V-8-C or Figure V-8-D shall conform to the requirements of the applicable base zoning district.

*Note: Permitted and conditional land uses from all permitted base zoning districts have been combined within this figure. Land uses may be listed by more than one building type.
  (e)
Building type standards. New land uses and structures within the Rusher Street revitalization district will be developed consistent with one of the three building types identified in Figure V-8-D. These applicable building type standards address a range of design and development parameters including parcel arrangement and configuration; massing, scale, and location of buildings on a parcel; and, architectural components that create a uniform character of buildings and structures along the street. Building type standards are located in section 90-637.
(1)
New structures. All uses established in new principal or accessory structures in accordance with the building type standards of this division — regardless of whether they are classified as permitted or conditional within the base zoning district - shall be permitted by right and are not subject to the review and approval of the planning commission.
(2)
Existing structures. Permitted and conditional uses may be established or expanded within principal or accessory structures that are located in the Rusher Street revitalization district and existed before the CD-1 zoning designation was applied. In such instances, the building and structure may not conform to the applicable standards established in this division; and, the building official may require that pertinent building type standards contained within this division be met prior to the issuance of a building permit, use permit or certificate of occupancy. Existing structures and uses may also be subject to the provisions of subsection 90-620(h).
(f)
Character district streets. All new streets within the Rusher Street revitalization district shall be designed and constructed as character district streets as established in section 70-72 of the Code, unless an applicable character district street type does not exist to meet the performance requirements of the Federal Highway Administration's functional classification guidelines.
(g)
Conflicting provisions. Where the application of the character district requirements within this division will conflict or are inconsistent with the application of the requirements of the base zoning district, or with chapter 58 (Signs) of this Code, the character district requirements shall prevail.
(h)
Nonconforming structures and uses. Any building, structure or use of land within the Rusher Street revitalization district which does not comply with or conform to the regulations of this division but complied to the provisions of the base zoning district at the time the building, structure or use of land was established shall be deemed to be a nonconforming use, and shall be subject to the standards contained in division 2, article VI of this chapter; except, that such nonconforming use shall also be subject to the provisions of this subsection.
(1)
Discontinuance of nonconforming uses of land. In some instances, the nonconforming use of land within an existing building or structure in the Rusher Street revitalization district may be discontinued and be replaced by a conforming use of land. In such instances, the building and structure may remain nonconforming with the building type standards contained within this division. In these cases, the building official may require that pertinent building type standards of this division be met prior to the issuance of a building permit, use permit or certificate of occupancy.
(2)
Rezoning of nonconforming uses. The rezoning of parcels within the Rusher Street revitalization district, which contain buildings or structures that do not conform to the provisions of this division, to a more intense base zoning district shall constitute a discontinuance of the nonconforming use and shall require conformance to all of the provisions of this division.
(Ord. of 5-27-2009)
Sec. 90-621. - Building type standards.
(a)
Purpose. All construction within the Rusher Street revitalization district, unless otherwise exempted in subsection 90-636(d)(3), shall adhere to the building type standards contained in this section and accompanying appendices. The standards apply to three specific building types: detached house, multi-unit residential building and neighborhood commercial building. For all three building types, development standards are arranged into the following three categories:
(1)
Building placement and site arrangement.
(2)
Building height, massing and scale.
(3)
Building elements.
The vast majority of applicable building type standards can be found in the following appendices:
(1)
Appendix 90-A.1 (Detached House).
(2)
Appendix 90-A.2 (Multi-Unit Residential Building).
(3)
Appendix 90-A.3 (Neighborhood Commercial Building).
(b)
General principles of building placement and site arrangement.
(1)
In addition to the applicable building type standards contained in Appendix 90-A.1, 90-A.2 and 90-A.3, all three building types shall adhere to the general principles contained in this subsection and illustrated on Figure V-8-E.
a.
Buildings and structures shall be placed within the "buildable area" of a lot or parcel. The buildable area is defined by those portions of a parcel framed by the build-to line and setbacks.
b.
All lots within the CD-1 district shall be subject to a build-to line on lot frontages facing a public street.
c.
All lots within the CD-1 district shall be subject to a setback line on lot frontages facing an adjacent lot line or alley.
d.
No detached house, multi-unit residential building, or neighborhood commercial building shall encroach on that portion of a parcel which lies between the build-to-line or setback line, and the lot line.
e.
Accessory buildings and structures shall be located in the rear yard as established between the rear building line of the principal building and the rear.
f.
Lot arrangement and building placement shall create frontages that frame the street while avoiding unbroken facades that form a monotonous wall.
g.
Required off-street parking shall be provided for all residential and nonresidential uses in accordance with division 3 of article VI of this chapter, except as otherwise provided within this section.
h.
Standards contained within this subsection are referenced in Figure V-8-E.
APPENDIX 90-A.1: CD-1 BUILDING TYPE (DETACHED HOUSE)
Building Placement and Site Arrangement:
Build-to-Line and Setbacks:
a.
The build-to-line for the street facing facade of a detached house shall be 15 feet.
b.
A corner lot's side street build-to-line shall vary depending on the functional classification of the side street as established in chapter 70 of this Code. The side street build-to-line shall be 15 feet along minor streets, or the corresponding character district street type. The side street build-to-line shall be 20 feet along major streets, or the corresponding character district street type.
c.
The minimum rear and side yard setback from corresponding property lines without vehicular access to an alley shall be 5 feet. The minimum rear or side yard setback from corresponding property lines with vehicular access to an alley shall be 15 feet.
d.
Standards contained within this Subsection are referenced on FIGURE A.
Street Facade and Frontages:
a.
A detached house may have articulated facades which include projections of varying depth. While such variation is encouraged, at least 50 percent of the street facing building facade of a detached house shall be located at the build-to-line.
b.
The width of a detached house's front building facade shall span between 50 and 70 percent of the lot width as established at the front building line. Where such a provision is impractical due to the dimensions of a lot existing before the application of the CD-1 district, the location of the proposed detached house and accessory structures on the lot shall allow for the future split or reconfiguration of the remaining balance of the lot in order to accommodate the long-term building placement and site arrangement objectives of the CD-1 district.
c.
The front building facade of a detached house as viewed from the street shall emphasize the vertical dimension, shall not appear excessively wide; and, in no case shall exceed a width to height ratio of 1.5:1. The vertical dimension shall be calculated from the finished ground floor elevation at the build-to-line to a height equivalent with the peak of the roof. The horizontal dimension shall incorporate all structural building components including elements such as porches, bay windows, attached carports, etc.
d.
Standards contained within this subsection are referenced on Figures B and C.
Parking:
a.
Required off-street parking for residential uses may be located within an accessory building used as a garage, an accessory structure such as a carport, an exposed parking pad; and/or, that portion of a driveway aisle located within the buildable area of the lot.
b.
Required off-street parking for nonresidential uses may be located within an accessory building used as a garage, an accessory structure such as a carport, or on an exposed parking pad. On-street parking spaces located on that portion of a character district street directly adjacent to and abutting the frontage of the lot may be counted as meeting the applicable portion of the off-street parking requirement for the nonresidential use.
c.
Parking for nonresidential uses shall be located in the rear yard; except, that a single row of parking extending perpendicular from the street may be located in the side yard behind the front building line. In such instances, the parking spaces shall be bordered by a low wall and/or plantings between three and six feet, sufficient to screen motor vehicle headlights, along the adjacent portion of the build-to-line and side lot line.
d.
Portions of driveway aisles for residential uses between the build-to-line and the street right-of-way shall not exceed 12 feet in width. Portions of driveway aisles for nonresidential uses between street or alley right-of-way shall not exceed 12 feet in width for one-way traffic, or 16 feet in width for two-way traffic.
e.
Where an alley is available, sole or secondary vehicular access to off-street parking via the alley may be required by the building official in lieu of access from the street. Motor vehicle access to a lot from an alley shall be restricted to paved driveway aisles and parking pads. All other portions of a lot adjacent to an alley shall be separated from the alley by a low wall and/or plantings between two and four feet in height.
f.
The standards contained within this Subsection are referenced on Figures D.1 and D.2.
Encroachments:
a.
Encroachments of some building elements are permitted between the build-to-line and street right-of-way. Encroachments within side and rear yard setbacks are limited.
b.
Porches, balconies, stairs, awnings and bay windows are permitted to encroach beyond the build-to-line up to 8 feet.
c.
Overhanging eaves may encroach within the side and rear yard setback.
Building Height, Massing and Scale:
General Principles:
a.
Detached houses shall be measured in stories.
b.
A "story" within a detached house infers a habitable space.
Detached Houses:
a.
Detached houses shall include a crawl space, at least one story and an attic space.
b.
Detached houses shall not exceed 2.5 stories, including habitable attic space.
c.
Slab-on-grade construction of a detached house is not permitted — except for that portion of a detached house that is utilized as an attached garage. The minimum finished ground floor elevation is 30 inches above grade as established at the build-to-line.
d.
The height of each story, excluding habitable attic space, shall be determined by the interior clearance height (floor to ceiling) and floor to floor height between stories.
e.
The ground story height of a detached house shall provide for a floor to ceiling clearance of between nine feet and 12 feet. The maximum floor to floor height shall not exceed 16 feet.
f.
The upper story height of a detached house shall provide for a floor to ceiling clearance of at least eight feet. The maximum floor to floor height shall not exceed 12 feet.
g.
An attic space utilized as a habitable area shall be counted as a half story. The height of an attic space shall be variable depending on roof pitch.
h.
The standards contained within this subsection are referenced on FIGURE E.
Accessory Buildings:
a.
Accessory buildings may utilize slab-on-grade construction.
b.
Accessory buildings may not exceed a maximum height of 20 feet at the eave; however, in no case shall the peak of an accessory building's roof exceed that of the detached house.
c.
Accessory buildings shall not exceed a building footprint of 650 square feet — or 50 percent of the finished habitable first floor area of the detached house - whichever is less.
d.
The standards contained within this subsection are referenced on FIGURE E.
Massing:
a.
Each principal structure shall be designed as part of a larger composition of where it is situated. Adjacent or proximate buildings of similar type which were constructed consistent with the requirements of the CD-1 district shall exhibit a similar scale, height and configuration.
b.
The ratio of height to width on front building facades constructed according to the provisions of the CD-1 district shall be similar. Front building facades which emphasize a horizontal dimension are unacceptable.
Building Elements:
The preferred building elements within this subsection provide minimum architectural standards to be incorporated into the construction of a "detached house" building type within the CD-1 district. The features required by this subsection provide for a coherent character within the district, and building elements which foster personal interaction, while promoting lasting quality and value within the neighborhood.
Building Orientation and Access:
a.
A detached house shall be oriented so that the front building facade faces the street. On corner lots, the orientation of the front building facade shall typically correspond with the narrower street frontage, but shall also be determined based on convenience of vehicular access and the site arrangement of adjacent lots developed consistent with the requirements of the CD-1 district.
b.
The primary pedestrian entrance to a detached house shall be provided on the ground story of the front building facade. The functioning entry door shall face the street.
c.
A minimum three-foot wide paved pedestrian path shall be provided from the primary pedestrian entrance to the sidewalk; or, in lieu of a sidewalk to the driveway aisle.
d.
Where a detached house contains more than one independent leasable space (i.e. duplex, offices, etc.), the primary pedestrian entrance of only one of the units is required to be located on the front building facade. The primary pedestrian entrance of two units may face the street, but only if all other elements of the street facing facade provide the impression of a single-unit detached house. Alternatively, the primary pedestrian entrance may serve as a shared entrance to both units.
e.
In addition to the primary pedestrian entrance located on a detached house's front building facade, at least one more pedestrian entrance shall be located on the rear or side facade for each unit to promote pedestrian flow through the house. The location of the second required pedestrian entrance for nonresidential uses shall correspond to the location of the majority of the use's required off-street parking.
Fenestration:
a.
Fenestration requirements are applicable to street facing building facades and building facades that face any other public or common area.
b.
Fenestration — including doors and windows - shall comprise no less than 25 percent of the ground story facade. Fenestration is measured as the area comprising the opening in the faced. Framing elements with a dimension of greater than one inch are excluded from calculating ground story facade fenestration.
c.
Blank lengths of wall on all habitable stories shall not exceed 15 feet in length as measured between openings. This provision is applicable to gabled habitable attic stories.
d.
Double-hung windows are required on applicable building facades. Casement or sliding type windows are not permitted.
e.
Window openings are arranged horizontally and shall emphasize the vertical dimension. The arrangement of windows between stories shall be such that openings are visually compatible in proportion and alignment.
f.
Openings shall be situated such that they reveal the interior space and do not span across structural elements separating rooms or floors.
g.
The standards contained within this subsection are referenced on FIGURE F.
Porches:
a.
A front porch is a required component of a detached house's front building facade. Front porches may be full facade, partial facade or wrap-around in style.
b.
A front porch shall be constructed at a minimum depth of six feet; and, at a minimum shall span at least 12 feet in width, or 50 percent of the front building facade, whichever is greater.
c.
Recessed front porches shall project at least three feet beyond the front building facade, exclusive of encroachments permitted in this Appendix.
d.
Porches must be roofed and framed by posts that extend to the roof and balustrades. Posts and railings shall incorporate architectural elements to provide visual interest.
e.
Porches shall not be enclosed above a railing height of 42 inches except for screening.
f.
The standards contained within this subsection are referenced on FIGURE G.
Roofs:
a.
The main roof of a detached house shall incorporate symmetrical gables or hips with a pitch between 6:12 and 12:12.
b.
The pitch of roofs on elements such as dormers, porches, stoops, etc.; and accessory buildings and structures, shall closely conform to the main roof of the detached house but in no case shall be less than 4:12 or more than 12:12.
c.
Elements that are accessory to the detached house such as dormers, porches, stoops, etc., may incorporate a mono-pitch (shed) roof.
d.
Overhanging eaves may expose rafters but flush eaves shall be finished by profiled molding or gutters.
Garages:
a.
Attached garages shall be located to the rear of the detached house and shall not project beyond the side building facade, nor above the roofline of the detached house as viewed from the street.
b.
Attached garages shall not exceed 650 square feet — or 50 percent of the finished habitable floor area of the detached house - whichever is less.
c.
Detached garages are considered accessory structures and shall adhere to all applicable provisions contained within this section.
Utility Connections:
a.
Utility connections, including water, sewer and gas meters shall not be located on the street facing building facade; but where feasible, shall be located on the rear facade.
Signage:
a.
Signs shall be permitted within the Rusher Street revitalization district in accordance to the provisions of chapter 58 of this code as applied to the base zoning district and use of the lot, except for those provisions which are specifically in conflict with this subsection.
b.
Bench, portable, pole mounted free-standing and shopping center signs are not permitted on a lot containing a detached house regardless of the provisions otherwise applicable to the base zoning district and use.
c.
There shall be no more than one detached ground sign for all eligible uses on a lot, regardless of the number of businesses on the lot or number of street frontages. Signage for multiple businesses on one lot shall be consolidated into a single ground sign.
d.
Wall signs shall be confined to street frontages that do not serve as the detached house's front building facade, and shall not obscure any opening or architectural element such windows, porch posts, railings, etc.

DIVISION 9. - PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 90-625. - Purpose.
The PUD planned unit development district is intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design concepts that conform to community quality-of-life benchmarks and that achieves a high level of aesthetics, high-quality development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other community goals by:
(1)
Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and development standards that were designed primarily for individual lots;
(2)
Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the same development, including residential, commercial, and professional, with a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities;
(3)
Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and the provision of active recreational activities, for example ball fields, golf courses, swimming pools or tennis courts;
(4)
Linking areas within the development by providing pedestrian-ways, bike-ways, and transportation systems and connecting to public sidewalks and bike paths as feasible;
(5)
Promoting quality urban and traditional neighborhood design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing development to take advantage of special site characteristics, locations, and land uses.
(Ord. of 9-9-2019)
Sec. 90-626. - Establishment of planned unit developments.
(a)
A planned unit development is established by rezoning certain real property and adopting a development plan.
(b)
The development plan establishes regulations for the use, development, improvement and maintenance of the PUD, and shall include the following:
(1)
The permitted, conditionally permitted and accessory uses, including any applicable development regulations, architectural standards, phasing plans;
(2)
A site plan, including the site area; street layout, including typical street sections, traffic study, pedestrian facilities, bike paths, landscaping plan, and open space areas, utility location, signage location, and applicable amenities, and to further include:
a.
Minimum lot area(s);
b.
Minimum lot width(s);
c.
Size(s) and location(s) of yard(s) and setback(s);
d.
Maximum impervious surface ratio for individual lots and the development as a whole;
e.
Off-street and on-street parking and loading needs and dimensions; and
f.
Internal traffic calming strategies.
(3)
The number of residential units by type, square footage of residential and non-residential units;
(4)
A statement regarding consistency with the comprehensive plan and all other applicable plans, including maximum structure height(s);
(5)
Any information necessary for the substantive and environmental review of the proposed project, to specifically insure roadway design and stormwater standards adheres to environmentally sensitive and aesthetically pleasing best management practices and development standards; and
(6)
Any other information deemed necessary by the building official.
(c)
The planned unit development district is permitted only in areas where public and sewer are available. Proposals must be compatible with the character of surrounding land uses. It is recognized that some concepts will be more appropriate than others and the approval of an application in one location does not necessarily indicate the development will be suitable in other locations.
(Ord. of 9-9-2019)
Sec. 90-627. - Regulations for planned unit development district.
(a)
A listing of permitted uses within a particularly planned unit development shall be adopted as part of the regulations applying to that district only. The uses permitted shall be consistent with the list of permitted uses in article II, III, and V of this chapter. Industrial uses are prohibited within planned unit developments.
(b)
In addition to the requirements established in section 90-637 (b), the following site development characteristics shall be determined and set in the approved development plan.
(c)
The minimum side building setback shall be ten feet for all single-family detached units, and on the detached side of all single-family attached units. This minimum notwithstanding, the character of a proposed (or "the proposed" or "a particular") planned residential development may justify smaller side setbacks. Certain development types, including, but not limited to, traditional neighborhood development, pocket neighborhoods, and some residential infill solutions may benefit from the use of smaller setbacks to achieve the development concept. The city council may, where justified by the development concept, approve minimum side building setbacks below ten feet.
(d)
The minimum rear building setback will be ten feet.
(e)
Residential driveways shall be a minimum of 20 feet long between the garage and sidewalk or back of curb (where sidewalks are not present).
(f)
Streets and alleys shall terminate at other streets within the development and shall be "stubbed out" at the edge of the project site to provide linkages with future development. Connections shall be made to "stub outs" on adjacent parcels. The use of dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs should be minimized and must be approved by planning commission in cases where site topography necessitates their use.
(g)
A minimum of ten percent of the usable project area shall be permanently allocated to open space.
(1)
A portion of the required open space shall be centrally located within the development. Location and approximate size of the open space area shall be designated and approved by the planning commission as part of conceptual approval.
(2)
For developments under ten acres, the open space requirement may be satisfied by an existing or proposed public park or trail network that is within 1,300 feet of the development boundary.
(3)
Stormwater infrastructure may not be counted toward the required open space, unless designed as part of a low-impact system that utilizes bio-swales and natural recharge areas.
(4)
Utility easements may not be counted toward the required open space, unless utilized as part of a common trail network or other amenity.
(h)
The site development characteristics prescribed by the approved development plan associated with a planned unit development shall supplant any conflicting standards for site development established in the City of Washington Code of Ordinances. Any site development characteristics not prescribed in the approved plans for a planned unit development shall be subject to the minimum standards, if applicable, established in the City of Washington Code of Ordinances.
(Ord. of 9-9-2019)
Sec. 90-628. - Revisions.
(a)
Minor changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant that do not alter district boundaries and that involve revision of minor characteristics of a PUD, such as relocation of driveways, façade details, drainage structures, number of required parking spaces, and other features that do not materially affect the approved plan concept or violate any other applicable regulations, may be approved by the building official. Variations to residential density less than five percent of the initially-approved density constitute minor changes.
(b)
Major changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant that alter district boundaries or that materially affect the characteristics or functionality of the PRD, such as changes in the general layout of buildings and their environs on the site, changes to the district regulations, or landscaping shall be submitted under the provisions of section 90-806 pertaining to zoning changes and ordinance amendments, and must be approved by the city council. Variations to residential density that are five percent or greater of the initially-approved density constitute major changes.
