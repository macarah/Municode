Market risk shall be avoided by limiting investments to a maximum one-year of maturity, except for special circumstances where an interest rate differential and certainty of ability to hold the investment to maturity would justify a longer maturity.

DIVISION 7. - FIXED ASSETS

Sec. 2-275.5. - Fixed asset criteria.
(a)
A fixed asset is defined as a financial resource meeting all of the following criteria:
(1)
It is tangible in nature.
(2)
It has a useful life of greater than one year.
(3)
It is not a repair part or supply item.
(4)
It has a value equal to, or greater than, the capitalization threshold of $5,000.00.
(b)
Keeping an accurate record of the city's fixed assets is important for a myriad of reasons. Some of the most important reasons that the city needs to keep a good record of fixed assets are: for financial statement information, for insurable values, for control and accountability, for maintenance scheduling and cost analysis, for estimating and accounting for depreciation, for preparation of capital and operating budgets, and for debt management.
(Mo. of 3-9-04(1))
Sec. 2-275.6. - General policy.
(a)
Each department head is ultimately responsible for the proper recording, acquisition, transfer, and disposal of all assets within their department. City property may not be acquired, transferred, or disposed of without first providing proper documentation. A fixed asset information form must accompany each step.
(b)
Recording of fixed assets. Unless otherwise approved by the city clerk, all recordable fixed assets must be recorded within 30 calendar days after receipt and acceptance of the asset.
(c)
A fixed asset form must be attached to the purchase order before submitting request for payment.
(d)
Assets will be capitalized at acquisition cost, including expenses incurred in preparing the asset for use.
(e)
Donated assets shall be recorded at fair market value as determined by the department head. Fair market value may be defined as, but is not limited to, an average of documented prices for equivalent items from three separate vendors.
(f)
The city will recognize acquisition costs based on individual unit prices. Assets should not be grouped. For example, in acquiring equipment, if three personal computers (PC) were acquired simultaneously at $2,000.00 each, this would not be an asset of $6,000.00 consisting of three PCs. Instead, it would be three separate acquisitions of $2,000.00. Each PC would be recorded as a separate controllable item.
(g)
For equipment purchases, title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received. Similarly, for donated assets, title is considered to pass when the asset is available for the agency's use and when the agency assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset.
(h)
Constructed assets are transferred from the construction in progress account to the related building, improvements other than buildings, or equipment accounts when they become operational. Constructed buildings, for example, are assumed to be operational when an authorization to occupy the building is issued, regardless of whether or not final payments have been made on all the construction contracts.
(Mo. of 3-9-04(1))
Sec. 2-275.7. - Acquisition.
There are various methods by which assets can be acquired. The asset acquisition method determines the basis for valuing the asset. Fixed assets may be acquired in the following ways:
(1)
New purchases.
(2)
Donations.
(3)
Transfers from other city departments.
(4)
City surplus.
(5)
Internal/external construction.
(6)
Lease purchases.
(7)
Trade-in.
(8)
Forfeiture or condemnation.

Sec. 2-275.8. - Lease purchases.
(a)
Assets may be lease-purchased through installment purchases (an agreement in which title passes to the department) or through lease financing arrangements (an agreement in which title may or may not pass).
(b)
Departments considering a lease purchase for greater than $10,000.00 and other than from an established, city approved contract, must consult with the city manager.
(Mo. of 3-9-04(1))
Sec. 2-275.9. - Transfer.
(a)
An asset transfer between departments usually represents the sale of an item by one department to another and may be treated as a new purchase. A transfer between related departments under the same control (police and fire, for example) may, if desired, be treated as a transfer rather than sale. That is, the asset is recorded under the new department with original acquired date and funding amount.
(b)
A fixed asset form must be sent to the accounting department for all transfers.
(Mo. of 3-9-04(1))
Sec. 2-275.10. - Sale.
Sale of fixed assets by a department must be to the highest, responsible bidder and must be conducted by sealed bid or by auction. The sale must be publicized in accordance with state laws.
(Mo. of 3-9-04(1))
Sec. 2-275.11. - Disposal.
(a)
When an asset is disposed of, its value is removed from the financial balances reported and from inventory reports; however, the asset record, including disposal information, remains on the master file for three years, in the city clerk's office, after which time it is purged from the system according to general accepted accounting principles. This preserves an audit trail for disposed items, and facilitates departmental comparisons between actual or historical useful life information with useful life guidelines. Such comparisons permit a more precise definition of an asset's useful life than those provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other guidelines initially used.
(b)
A disposal action is appropriate only when certain conditions occur resulting in an asset no longer being in the possession of the agency. Assets no longer in use, which remain in the possession of the department, are considered surplus property and not a disposal.
(c)
Fixed assets may be disposed of in any one of six ways:
(1)
Sale or trade-in.
(2)
Abandonment/retirement.
(3)
Lost or stolen.
(4)
Transfer.
(5)
Cannibalization (taking parts and employing them for like uses within the department, such as is often the practice in computer or vehicle maintenance).
(6)
Casualty loss.
(d)
Only when the asset is no longer in possession of the department, due to one of the six reasons listed above, is disposal action appropriate.
(e)
Assets are "abandoned" or "retired" when there is no longer any use for them in the department, they are of no use to any other city department, they cannot be repaired, transferred, cannibalized, sold, or traded-in. Thus meaning that, there is no safe and appropriate use for the abandoned goods to the city or for others.
(f)
Stolen items must be reported to the police department and a police report filed. A copy of this report must accompany the disposal record.
(g)
Casualty losses must be documented within 24 hours of loss and reported to the city's administrative services director immediately for follow-up with the city's insurance carrier.
(h)
Cannibalized items are considered surplus and are disposed of by noting cannibalization on the disposal record. Ideally, this method will allow departments to look at cannibalized items on the disposal report and assess what surplus parts may be available. Departments will send documentation of items cannibalized to the city clerk's office, and all remaining costs and accumulated depreciation will be removed from appropriate asset accounts in the general fixed asset fund.
(i)
All assets no longer in the possession of the department, due to one of these six qualifying conditions and after submission of all appropriate documentation to the city clerk's office, will be removed from the master departmental asset file and considered disposed.
(j)
Department management is responsible for reviewing disposal reports, evaluating causes and trends leading to disposals, and implementing procedures to more effectively manage and control disposals when the dispositions represent problems, inefficiencies, and/or the incurrence of unnecessary cost.
(Mo. of 3-9-04(1))
Sec. 2-275.12. - Physical inventory.
An annual physical inventory of all fixed assets will be performed by each department head. The inventory will be conducted with the least amount of interruption possible to the department's daily operation. A full report of the results of the inventory will be sent, within 30 days of completion, to all departments for verification and acceptance.
