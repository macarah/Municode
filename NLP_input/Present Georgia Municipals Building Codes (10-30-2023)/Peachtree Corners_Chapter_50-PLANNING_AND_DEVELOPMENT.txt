(Ord. No. 2013-01-04, § 5-1, 1-29-2013)
Sec. 50-115. - Permits.
(a)
Land disturbing permit required. Land disturbing activities shall not commence until such activities have been authorized by issuance of an appropriate land disturbing permit under the provisions of the development regulations. Once a final plat has been recorded, land disturbing activities on residential lots shall not occur until a building permit has been obtained.
(b)
Tree preservation and/or replacement plan required. For projects not exempt from the provisions of this division, and not included under subsection (c) of this section, a tree preservation and/or replacement plan shall be submitted, along with the tree canopy calculation, and the other documents required by the development regulations for the issuance of a clearing, clearing and grubbing, grading, or development permit.
(1)
Tree preservation and/or replacement plans, including the tree canopy calculation, and related documentation shall be reviewed by the department for conformance to the provisions of this division along with and at the same time as all other plans required for a requested land disturbing permit under the provisions of the development regulations.
(2)
Clearing, grading and development activities shall conform in all respects with the approved tree preservation and/or replacement plan. Any revisions to the proposed development of a property, and any changes reflected in a subsequently submitted permit application, shall be shown on a revised tree preservation and/or replacement plan and be approved as part of the new or revised permit prior to the commencement of such changed activities.
(c)
Limited land disturbing projects.
(1)
Projects which propose only limited development activities may be issued a land disturbing permit without a tree preservation and/or replacement plan under the following circumstances:
a.
Private or public utility easements and public greenways on public access easements and private or public utility easements shall not be required to submit a tree preservation and/or replacement plan if the proposed land disturbing activities are strictly limited to those directly related to the placement of required soil erosion and sedimentation controls, the installation of public or private utilities, the installation of public greenways on public access easements and private or public easements, or other required improvements expressly required by the city or by a condition of zoning, special use, modification, waiver or variance approval.
b.
Residential recreation areas, individual multifamily residential and attached townhomes (not on individual lots), and nonresidential projects (not involving the subdivision of the property) may not be allowed to undertake activities limited to clearing, or clearing and grubbing only, without approval of a tree preservation and/or replacement plan. Additional areas may be designated by the department to remain undisturbed as may be reasonably required with consideration given to the proposed use of the property, as well as adjacent properties, in accordance with the city's land use plan. The limits of clearing or clearing and grubbing shall be established no closer to the boundaries of all said undisturbed areas than the driplines of the trees that are located within said areas.
(2)
For any property for which a tree preservation and/or replacement plan was not required prior to issuance of a land disturbing permit under the provisions of this section, all areas required to be undisturbed shall be provided with protective tree fencing along the limits of clearing or grading which adjoin existing trees in accordance with the provisions found in section 50-117(a). These measures shall be in place prior to beginning clearing or grading activities and shall be maintained throughout the land disturbing period.
(d)
Residential lots and subdivisions. Owners and/or developers of single-family detached residential lots and subdivisions shall comply with this division by planting street trees in all residential subdivisions and two trees per lot, as a part of providing 16 TDUs per acre. Existing trees shall be counted toward the TDUs.
(1)
Individual lot trees. A minimum of two trees, at least two inches in diameter, shall be planted or preserved on each individual lot prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Roots within the drip line area of preserved trees shall remain undisturbed or the tree cannot be counted as a required tree. Planted trees shall be a species listed in Appendix A which is on file and available for public review in the office of the city clerk. The location of two trees per lot is not limited to the front yard. Trees can be planted in any location on the lot except in utility and drainage easements and septic drain fields.
(2)
Street trees. Underground utilities are required when planting street trees. Street tree requirements are as follows:
a.
Street trees shall be at least three inches in diameter. The quantity of trees shall be at least one tree per each 50 linear feet of street (both sides of the street). Trees shall be planted in the street right-of-way. Trees shall be located at least three feet from the back of curb unless a modification is granted by the director. Street trees listed in Appendix A which is on file and available for public review in the office of the city clerk, shall be selected, planted and maintained. Maximum allowable genus of street trees shall be 33 percent of entire subdivision or one genus per street. Street trees count towards meeting the 16 TDUs per acre.
b.
Developers shall enter into a performance surety agreement with the department guaranteeing tree planting within two years of the date of recording of the final plat. The director is authorized to grant a modification from the time limit. The performance surety shall be provided at the time of recording the final plat. In addition, a street tree planting plan shall be submitted to and approved by the department prior to planting by the developer. Street tree planting shall be delayed from June through August.
c.
Street trees shall be maintained and cared for by the property owner adjacent to the tree except in subdivisions in which the property owners association provides maintenance and care. Maintenance shall include replacement and trimming as necessary. A maintenance responsibility statement shall be provided on the final plat. A modification may be granted by the director for genus and species substitution for street trees.
(3)
16 TDUs per acre and tree protection areas. Prior to the issuance of a development permit, a tree preservation plan shall be prepared and approved for residential subdivisions indicating compliance with the tree density standard of 16 tree density units per acre. Preserved trees shall be grouped together in tree protection areas (including driplines or critical root zones whichever is greater) consisting of at least three trees. Preserved individual 12-inch or greater diameter trees may also receive credit provided they are protected by a tree protection area (including dripline or critical root zone, whichever is greater). Planted and preserved trees count towards tree density units per acre.
(Ord. No. 2013-01-04, § 5-2, 1-29-2013)
Sec. 50-116. - Tree density requirements.
(a)
Tree density standard. On each property for which a tree preservation and/or replacement plan is required, existing trees shall be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed a tree density standard of 16 tree density units per acre, exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer and any trees required to be preserved or planted within a zoning buffer and except any other land area allowed to be excluded by this division. Trees, both existing and new, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site, with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees, including street trees, may be retained or planted for credit within a public street right-of-way if granted authorization by the department of transportation.
(b)
Tree density standard calculation. The tree density standard shall be calculated by summing the following credits and dividing by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application (but excluding any acreage included within a zoning buffer and other land area allowed to be excluded by this division):
(1)
Credit for existing trees proposed to be preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table B of this section, Credit for Existing Trees. Credit shall be given all trees preserved on a property having a diameter of three inches or more, except trees located in a required zoning buffer.
(2)
Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table D of this section, Credit for Replacement Trees. Credit shall be given for all new trees replaced on a property except for trees one inch or less in diameter and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum two inches in diameter and evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height. Multi-trunked trees shall only be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk and not the cumulative total of the various trunks. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit for satisfying the required tree density standard.
(3)
Credit for specimen trees preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table C of this section, Credit for Specimen Trees. Credit shall be given for all specimen trees preserved on a property except for those located in a required zoning buffer where partial credit may be given. A specimen tree located within a buffer with a critical root zone extending beyond the buffer is allowed partial credit toward tree density units. The partial credit is based on the percentage of CRZ that is outside of the buffer. For example: given a 30-inch specimen tree's CRZ extends by 20 percent over the buffer line, then the developer receives 20 percent of the credit for a 30-inch existing specimen tree (19.6 x .20 = 3.92 TDUs). To determine the percentage of CRZ outside of the buffer simply measure the area of the CRZ circle. Then measure the area of CRZ outside of the buffer. Divide the smaller number into the larger number and that is your percentage of CRZ. For example: given a specimen tree's CRZ is 6,000 square feet, 1,200 square feet is outside of the buffer. Divide 1,200 by 6,000 and the answer is 0.2. In other words, 20 percent of the CRZ is outside of the buffer.
(4)
Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances:
a.
For specimen trees see section 50-119 and Table C of this section.
b.
Existing trees to be preserved within a minimum yard area (as required by the applicable zoning district) or within a 100-year floodplain shall be granted a bonus credit of 50 percent of the units assigned in Table B unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer.
(5)
There shall be no more than 33 percent of any one genus of tree for overall site. Provide all calculations on plan.
(c)
Tree canopy calculation.
(1)
The tree canopy calculation is required for all new developments and existing developments adding structural or site improvements as defined in section 50-114.
(2)
The tree canopy shall be calculated by assigning square feet of canopy to each tree proposed and each tree preserved. Square feet of canopy can be found in Appendix A which is on file and available for public review in the office of the city clerk. Stands of three or more trees can be computed with polygons and given in terms of square feet. Include buffer trees, landscape strip trees, parking lot trees and any tree preserved or replaced. Add the total square feet of canopy. Take the total site acreage and convert that to square feet. Divide the total square feet of canopy into the total square feet for the site and list it as a percentage. Provide calculations on the tree preservation/replacement plan. There is no minimum or maximum tree canopy percentage required at this time.

  (d)
Tree bank.
(1)
The intent of the buffer, landscape, and tree ordinance requirements is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The tree bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the director before the tree bank may be utilized. The tree bank provides two options, which are described in full below.
(2)
Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the tree bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum tree density units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the tree bank in accordance with Option One or Option Two below.
a.
Option One, planting trees off-site. Install an equal amount of required tree density units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case, the following criteria shall be observed:
1.
The city department of planning and development, in conjunction with the tree advisory committee, has prepared a non-exclusive list of alternate Option One sites. The city department of planning and development has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the tree bank. Persons wishing to utilize Option One should consult with the city department of planning and development to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the city department of planning and development with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited.
2.
The developer shall submit a tree preservation/tree replacement plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be two inches in diameter at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required, each tree must be three inches in diameter at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan.
3.
If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that it agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the tree preservation/tree replacement plan.
4.
The site for the trees shall be within the same district in which the development is located or within five miles of the original development per the director's approval.
5.
Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one-year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual, latest edition.
b.
Option Two, monetary compensation for trees. A developer may choose to provide the city department of planning and development with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed:
1.
Provide tree density calculations on the tree preservation/tree replacement plan. Show the total amount of tree density units that cannot be met on site.
2.
Multiply the tree density units that cannot be met on site by the monetary compensation value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the tree preservation/tree replacement plan. Contact the planning and development certified arborist or landscape architect for the current monetary compensation value.
3.
Provide a certified check in the amount of the product given on the tree preservation/tree replacement plan made out to the city. Give the certified check to a development review section planner along with a copy of the tree preservation, tree replacement plan.
4.
The monies collected for the tree bank Option Two may be used by the department of planning and development, community services, and/or support services for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, and libraries within the same district in which the development is located or within five miles of such district. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the director of the department of planning and development. Standards for administering these alternative compliance methods:
(i)
The director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement.
(ii)
The site development permit shall be issued after the director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds.

Sec. 50-117. - Tree preservation and replacement requirements.
(a)
Guidelines and standards for tree preservation and density. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be preserved for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard on a property:
(1)
Tree protection areas. The root system is generally within the dripline or critical root zone. To protect these critical roots, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained.
a.
The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline or critical root zone of the tree or group of trees collectively.
b.
Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of the tree protection area.
c.
Construction site activities, such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection areas.
(2)
Protective barriers.
a.

Small sites in which it is clearly visible from one vantage point that there are no specimen trees on site will not be required to submit a tree survey or concept plan. The city shall require a letter from the certified arborist, authorized registered professional or urban forester certifying there are no specimen trees on site.
b.
A site that has been previously graded or cleared under a development permit or land disturbance permit and in which there are no specimen trees on site is not required to submit a tree survey or concept plan. The city shall require a letter from the certified arborist, authorized registered professional or urban forester certifying there are no specimen trees on site.
(f)
Specimen tree removal.
(1)
With director approval.
a.
If a specimen tree previously identified on the specimen tree survey to be preserved cannot be preserved due to site constraints, the developer shall submit to the director a statement of hardship alleging a necessity for removal of the specimen tree and site design alternatives. The director is hereby authorized to make a determination whether a specimen tree may be removed. Examples of hardship include, but are not limited to, a tree's proximity to overhead transmission lines and topography after site design options have been exhausted. Hardship factors require due justification and shall include documentation. Plans showing justification shall include specimen tree survey, existing and proposed contours, proposed site/concept plan, and photos of the tree.
b.
The director is hereby authorized to determine recompense requirements when a specimen tree requires removal based on site constraints. Recompense requirements shall not count toward existing specimen tree density units.
c.
If specimen tree removal is approved by the director, recompense tree units generated from removal of a specimen trees shall not be counted toward any landscape requirement, such as parking lot, landscape strip or buffer trees.
d.
The director is hereby authorized to make a final determination whether a tree is a specimen tree and whether it has historical significance.
(2)
Without director approval.
a.
If a specimen tree is removed without prior approval from the director, the penalty to replace that tree is two times the tree density units of the specimen tree removed. The replacement trees shall be three inches in diameter or greater.
b.
If a specimen tree is removed without director approval with no residual evidence of its condition with the exception of the trunk, the diameter of the trunk will determine if the tree was of specimen quality. Required recompense units shall be two times the tree density units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement trees shall be three inches or greater.
c.
If there is site evidence that a specimen tree is removed without plan approval and there is no residual evidence of its condition or trunk diameter, recompense requirements shall be a minimum of two 28-inch hardwood trees. The property owner will be required to plant 34.4 tree density units on site in addition to other site density requirements.
(g)
Specimen tree options. The following are suggested guidelines for successful specimen tree preservation:
(1)
Specimen tree value. At the option of developer and contractor a value of the tree can be computed and displayed on the tree protection fence during construction. Once the value is computed it can be written down in the English and Spanish languages on a weatherproof placard and placed on the tree protection fencing. The monetary replacement value of a specimen tree can be computed in two different ways:
a.
A certified arborist may compute the value using the standard ISA plant appraisal method.
b.
The replacement value of the tree is defined as the cost to replace a tree based on the requirements in subsection (f) of this section. Compute the value by taking the diameter of the specimen tree and match it to the existing credit unit value for that tree. The result is the total number of credit units attributed to the specimen tree. For this example the tree was removed without prior director approval, therefore the tree density unit for the specimen tree must be multiplied by two. Take the total and divide by 0.6 (a three-inch diameter replacement tree is worth 0.6 units). The result is the number of trees necessary to replace the specimen tree. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost of the tree, including planting, labor and materials. The result is the total cost to replace the specimen tree or "the value" of the specimen tree.
(2)
Example. Given a 36-inch diameter oak tree:
a.
Credit value = 28.4 Credit Units.
b.
A three-inch diameter replacement tree = 0.6 credit units (See Table D of this division).
c.
28.4 times two = 56.8.
d.
56.8 divided by 0.6 = 94.66 replacement trees needed.
e.
95 times $250.00 (estimated cost) = $23,750.00 = Value of the tree.

DIVISION 5. - PLAN AND PLAT SPECIFICATIONS

Sec. 50-137. - Water-efficient design consideration.
(a)
Policy. It is the policy of the city to encourage individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this division to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design.
(b)
Principles and techniques of water-efficient landscaping (xeriscaping). The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows:
(1)
Proper location and design. Locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high water using plants.
(2)
Turf selection. Limiting turf areas, and selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region.
(3)
Efficient watering. Once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to ten days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants.
(4)
Soil improvements. Loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots.
(5)
Mulching. Using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds.
(6)
Plant selection. Selecting plants native or suitable to the region according to their watering requirements and optimum locations.
(7)
Maintenance. Maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservation, such as increasing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells.
