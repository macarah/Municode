Footnotes:
--- (9) ---
Editor's noteâ€” An amendment dated November 1, 2007, amended Chapter 8 to read as herein set out. Formerly, Chapter 8 pertained to amendments and applications and derived from Amd. of 3-26-2001; Amd. of 5-12-2003; Amd. of 9-25-2003; Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 5-17-2004; Amd. of 11-15-2004; Amd. of 12-20-2004.

ARTICLE I. - APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS

8-1.1. - Authority to amend.
This chapter establishes the authority to amend this Code, including the zoning map, and establishes the appropriate procedures to do so. It specifies the application requirements and process for the following types of applications: Amendments to the official text of this Code, amendments to the official zoning map/rezonings (hereafter only referred to as rezonings), conditional use permits (CUPs), home occupations, mobile vending, sketch plats, variances, appeals of administrative decisions, appeals of zoning board of appeals decisions, and zoning condition amendments.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 10-8-2020(1))
ARTICLE II. - APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
The following requirements shall be submitted for all applications, unless otherwise specified in the text of this chapter. Additional requirements that vary per application type are delineated in articles IV through X of this chapter. County initiated applications are exempt from these requirements, but shall otherwise follow all requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act. A summary of application requirements can be found in Table 8.1. An optional pre-application meeting may be requested by the applicant to discuss the general aspects of the proposal, the process, and information that will be required from the applicant in order to submit a complete application. Preliminary discussions are not binding on either the applicant or the county. This is often the first opportunity to review submittal requirements and procedures and is intended to assist in filing complete applications.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012)

8-2.1. - Requirements for all applications.
All applications specified in this chapter shall be submitted on forms provided by the county and shall be submitted with the documentation required for each type of application. The director is hereby authorized to establish administrative deadlines for the receipt of applications and associated information in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(a)
Form. All applications shall be submitted using the appropriate application form per each application type, as specified by the department.
(1)
Review of application completeness. Upon submittal, each application shall be subjected to a review of application completeness prior to being officially accepted by the county. An application shall be considered "complete" if it is submitted on the required form, includes all submittal information, including all exhibits specified by the director, and accompanied by the application processing fee as adopted by the board of commissioners and as may be revised periodically. The review of application completeness shall be conducted by county staff within five business days of the submittal deadline. If the county determines the application is complete, the application shall be processed pursuant to this chapter. If the county determines that the application is incomplete, county staff shall notify the applicant of that fact via the contact information provided and specify the ways in which the application is deficient. All incomplete applications shall receive no further processing until the deficiencies are corrected via a new submittal. Resubmittal of the application shall be treated as a new application. Under no circumstances may county staff delay conducting the review of application completeness in excess of five business days of the submittal deadline. If the review of application completeness is not completed within five business days of the submittal deadline, the application shall be determined complete.
(b)
Submittal fees. All applications shall be submitted with the required fee. The amount of each fee will be established by the director, and approved by the board of commissioners, which may be revised periodically. Applicants may apply for more than one application simultaneously and such applications may be simultaneously considered by the county as more specifically provided by this chapter. In the case that more than one application is filed simultaneously, the applicant shall be responsible for filing the appropriate information and paying the specified fees for each application filed. All fees are nonrefundable once the application has been determined complete.
(c)
Boundary survey. All applications shall be accompanied by ten copies of a boundary survey prepared by a registered land surveyor, and one copy of the boundary survey shall be reduced to a size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches.
(d)
Legal description. All applications shall be accompanied by a written metes and bounds legal description. It must establish a point of beginning and from the point of beginning give each dimension bounding the property, calling the directions (e.g. north, northeasterly, southerly, etc.) which the boundary follows around the property returning to the point of beginning. If there are multiple properties, all properties shall be combined into one legal description.
(e)
Site plan minimum requirements. All applications shall be accompanied by ten copies of a site plan and one copy of the site plan reduced to a size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches. For applications for properties greater than ten acres, the required site plan shall be prepared in full compliance with this subsection by a land surveyor, professional engineer, landscape architect or architect licensed to practice in the state of Georgia and shall be stamped and sealed by such stated professional in accord with Georgia law. The site plan so prepared may contain a disclaimer, as allowed by industry practice or applicable licensure requirements that the site plan is not to be considered an engineered document. For applications regarding properties of ten acres or less, the site plan shall comply with the minimum information contents described in this subsection, but need not be prepared by a licensed professional as noted above. If details submitted on a site plan do not meet numerical requirements as identified in this Code, a specific variance request shall be included on the submitted application. Unless otherwise specified in the board approval, the site plan submitted as part of the application shall be considered binding on the applicant. Site plans submitted under the requirements of this chapter are not engineered, and as such the term "binding" does not imply that it is site plan specific; rather it implies that the locations and/or uses are what the applicant intends to implement on the subject property. In any instance where the site plan conflicts with this Code, or any other county regulation, and there is not an approved variance, the regulation shall take precedent. The boundary of the site plan shall match the boundaries of the submitted boundary survey and the legal description. The site plan shall at minimum contain the following information (as applicable):
(1)
Proposed layout of streets, alleys, lots, and pedestrian circulation systems;
(2)
Lot or tract dimensions with required setbacks shown;
(3)
Required and proposed buffers;
(4)
Required and proposed, landscape areas, common areas, and open space;
(5)
Proposed structures with square footages (except for single family residential subdivisions);
(6)
Proposed uses for each structure (e.g. retail sales, offices, townhouses, etc.);
(7)
Existing and proposed zoning districts of the subject property and abutting property;
(8)
Proposed and existing location and use of all structures on the subject property;
(9)
Existing and proposed right-of-way locations and dimensions and names of all roads and streets bounding the subject property;
(10)
Driveways and parking areas with number of provided parking spaces;
(11)
Loading and unloading facilities;
(12)
Preliminary and existing locations of storm drainage and structures;
(13)
Preliminary and existing locations and point of access for major utility lines (e.g. water, gas, electric, etc.);
(14)
Preliminary and existing wastewater facilities including areas reserved for drain fields and septic tanks or point of access, sewer easements and manholes;
(15)
Tax map/parcel number and owner name of subject property and all abutting property owners as shown on current county tax map records;
(16)
Existing tree canopy (general location of existing canopy as indicated on the county GIS aerial photography); and
(17)
Preliminary locations of environmental conditions (e.g. streams, wetlands, watershed protection districts, flood hazard areas, river corridor boundaries, groundwater recharge areas, etc.).
(f)
Confirmation of paid taxes. A copy of the paid tax receipt for subject property or a statement by an official in the tax commissioner's office or other official document issued by the tax commissioner's office indicating taxes have been paid for the last year that they were due.
(g)
Additional application requirements. Articles IV through IX of this chapter identify additional application requirements per each type of application.
(h)
Corporate/company disclosures. All applications shall identify the name of the applicant and, if the applicant is different from the property owner, be accompanied by a duly executed owner authorization. If either the applicant or owner are corporations or limited liability companies, the application shall contain the names of the corporate stockholders with ten percent ownership or greater, officers, and directors, unless the corporation has stock that is traded on a national stock exchange in which case the corporate name shall be sufficient. A limited liability company shall identify the name of all officers or members. In addition to the owner and applicant, the application shall further identify any parties having a direct financial interest in the zoning application other than the owner and applicant (for instance, the intended developer or anticipated commercial occupant if known). If such additional parties having a direct financial interest are corporations or companies, then the names of corporate stockholders with ten percent ownership or greater, officers, directors and company members shall be provided unless the corporation has stock that is traded on a national stock exchange in which case the corporate name shall be sufficient. In the event that public disclosure of the developer or commercial occupant may cause such developer or occupant to withdraw from pursuing a project due to competition, trade secret, or proprietary business concerns, and if the proposed development advances a bona fide economic development purpose, then an affidavit affirmatively declaring such shall be tendered with the application and in that event only the owner and/or authorized applicant shall be identified. The affidavit contemplated in this paragraph shall only be valid for its intended purpose if it is also signed by a duly authorized representative of the Forsyth County Development Authority, Cumming/Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce, or the Forsyth County Manager, with such signature certifying that the pertinent individual is aware of the proposed development and confirms that the proposed development advances a bona fide economic development purpose. For purposes of this paragraph, a bona fide economic development purpose means a development that would be eligible for an inducement under section 22-260 of the Forsyth County Economic Development Ordinance.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 5-2-2013; Amd. of 2-6-2014; Amd. of 12-3-2015; Amd. of 4-13-2017(1); Amd. of 4-4-2019)
8-2.2. - Withdrawal of applications.
Applications as specified in this chapter may be withdrawn in conformance with the following provisions or as specified in this Code:
(a)
Applicant withdrawal. All applications may be withdrawn upon the written request of the applicant. Withdrawal requests received prior to the date that public notice is provided in a newspaper of general circulation may be withdrawn without prejudice, and shall be permitted to be withdrawn without prejudice. Once public notice is provided in the newspaper of general circulation, the application shall be withdrawn with prejudice. However, the applicant may withhold the written request for withdrawal until the public hearing, in which the board with jurisdiction may permit applications to be withdrawn at the public hearing, but the withdrawal shall be with prejudice unless extenuating circumstances are evident and the board grants approval to withdraw without prejudice. There shall be no requirement that the pertinent board make specific findings of extenuating circumstances in order to allow withdrawal without prejudice. In no event shall an application be withdrawn more than once without prejudicing the right of the applicant to apply again within 12 months from the date the application was made.
(b)
Administrative withdrawal. In order to remove applications that have been pending for more than 180 days after the application enters applicant work time without being placed on a public hearing agenda, the director is hereby authorized to administratively withdraw said applications. For purposes of this section, "being placed on a public hearing agenda" shall be deemed to occur on the date on which the department deems an application complete for board consideration. Documentation shall be kept on file indicating the department's attempts to contact the applicant via the contact information provided. All administratively withdrawn applications shall be considered withdrawn with prejudice.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 9-7-2017(1); Amd. of 9-5-2019)
8-2.3. - Reconsideration of applications.
If an application is withdrawn with prejudice or denied by the zoning board of appeals or board of commissioners, then the same property with a substantially similar application may not be submitted for reconsideration until the expiration of at least 12 months immediately following the withdrawal at the planning commission public hearing or defeat of the application by the zoning board of appeals or board of commissioners at their public hearing, as the case may be.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007)
8-2.4. - Copies of policies and procedures, etc.
Copies of this chapter, and any rules of procedure adopted by the planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or board of commissioners, shall be available for distribution to the general public by the department during regular business hours.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007)
ARTICLE III. - PUBLIC HEARINGS AND NOTICES FOR ALL APPLICATIONS

8-3.1. - Public hearing required.
All applications as specified in this chapter shall require a public hearing prior to action on said application.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007)
8-3.2. - Who holds hearings.
The planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing on all applications. The public hearing shall constitute the public hearing that is required by the State Zoning Procedures Law (Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, sections 36-66-1 et seq.). All public hearings shall be heard in accordance with the annual schedule prepared for and adopted by each individual board, and as may be amended periodically. Public hearings shall be heard by:
(a)
Planning commission. The planning commission is hereby designated as the board that shall hold a public hearing on applications to amend the text of this Code, rezoning applications, conditional use permits, home occupations, and mobile vending. The planning commission shall also hold the public hearing on all variance requests that were filed and scheduled to be considered simultaneously and pertaining to the same property with a rezoning, conditional use permit, home occupation application, or mobile vending application. Recommendations on approval or denial of variances shall be made in accordance with the provisions set forth in article VI of this chapter.
(b)
Zoning board of appeals. The zoning board of appeals is hereby designated as the board that shall hold a public hearing on all appeals of administrative decisions and all variances; with the exception of variance requests that are approved administratively pursuant to 8-6.4(a); variance requests that would simultaneously apply to four or more existing or proposed lots or units within a single subdivision; or for variance requests that were filed and scheduled to be considered simultaneously and pertaining to the same property with another application in which the authority to hold the public hearing rests with either the planning commission or board of commissioners.
(c)
Board of commissioners. The board of commissioners is hereby designated as the board that shall hold the second public hearing on all amendments to the text of this Code. The board of commissioners shall also hold public hearings on all sketch plat applications and all variance applications that would simultaneously apply to four or more existing or proposed lots or units within a single subdivision that are not being simultaneously considered with a rezoning, or conditional use permit application. The board of commissioners shall also hold the public hearing for appeals of zoning board of appeals decisions and zoning condition amendments. Delegation of public hearings to the planning commission or zoning board of appeals in no way abrogates the right of the board of commissioners to initiate and conduct, at its discretion, a public hearing for any application.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-3-2008; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 7-18-2013; Amd. of 10-8-2020(1))

Preparation of public notice. Notice of public hearings before the planning commission and the zoning board of appeals shall be prepared and presented for publication by the director. Notice of public hearings before the board of commissioners shall be prepared and presented for publication by the county manager.

Newspaper. All applications shall publish a public hearing notice within a newspaper of general circulation in Forsyth County at least 15, but not more than 45 days prior to the date of any public hearing. All notices shall include, with the exception of amending the text of this Code, the application number, date, time, location, and purpose of the public hearing.

A public hearing sign shall be placed in a conspicuous location on the subject property at least 21, but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. The required sign shall state the time, place and purpose of the public hearing.
(2)
A sign affidavit shall be submitted to the department no later than the twenty-first day prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. Failure to turn in the sign affidavit by this deadline shall require an additional Zoning Review meeting for rezoning, conditional use permit, sketch plat, home occupation permit, and mobile vending applicants.
(3)
Where the land owned by the applicant does not border upon a public road in order that a passersby may see the sign which provides the public notice, the required sign shall be placed on the right-of-way of a public road nearest the property in question as well as upon the subject property.
(4)
Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences which may diminish the effectiveness of the public notice provided shall not void any proceedings or actions taken by any of the three boards or the director.
(5)
Once the zoning board of appeals or board of commissioners has made a final motion upon any application requiring a public hearing, the applicant shall be responsible for the removal of all public hearing signs. Failure to do so will result in a fine of $100.00 per day until the sign(s) are removed. Calculation of the fine shall begin three days after the motion to act on the application or the date the application is withdrawn.
(d)
Additional information. The director may request additional information regarding public notice if said information is deemed necessary to help the public understand the application request.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 9-7-2017(1); Amd. of 10-8-2020(1))
8-3.4. - Conduct of public hearings and procedures for considering applications.
The following procedures shall govern public hearings held for purposes of considering applications as specified in this chapter:
(a)
Presiding officer. The public hearing shall be conducted by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall be the chairman, or in the chairman's absence, a designated member of the body hearing the request according to each board's rules and procedures.
(b)
Requirements for speakers. Persons wishing to speak in support (including applicant and designated spokesperson) or opposition to any application shall provide their name and address on the specified form to county staff prior to speaking at the public hearing. In addition, each person shall be required to disclose any campaign contributions/gifts equal to or greater than $100.00 given to any Forsyth County elected official within two years of the public hearing date.
(c)
Time limits. Speakers at the public hearing shall be allowed up to ten minutes per side, provided, however, that the presiding officer may at his or her discretion elect to extend this time period equally to proponents and opponents. The presiding officer may also, at his or her discretion, permit presentations by other persons and allow the same to exceed the allotted times.
(d)
Actions made in public. Any recommendation, finding, decision, or other action taken by the planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or board of commissioners will be made in public, at the time of the public hearing or at the time said application is continued or deferred for future consideration at a regular meeting of the respective body; provided, however, that an application may be tabled only by the board of commissioners.
(e)
Effect of board decisions. All findings, or other action of the planning commission regarding applications for rezoning and conditional use permits, shall be in the form of recommendations to the board of commissioners. The findings and decision of the zoning board of appeals shall be final unless a person aggrieved shall, within ten days of such decision, petition the Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County to review the decision. All decisions by the board of commissioners shall be final, although an appeal of a board decision may be made in conformance with article XII of this chapter.
(f)
Any property owner or developer, as is applicable, that is granted a rezoning, zoning condition amendment, or conditional use permit under this Code shall have 18 months to commence development based upon the provisions of this Code that existed at the time the rezoning application, zoning condition amendment application, or conditional use permit application was accepted by the county. For purposes of this paragraph, the phrase "commence development" shall mean the application for and issuance of a land disturbance permit for a development that is authorized by the granted rezoning, zoning condition amendment, or conditional use permit. It is not the intention of this paragraph that the receipt of a permit unaccompanied by completion of the work authorized by the permit shall result in an entitlement to avoid future amendments to this Code. It is, rather, the intention of this Code that the application for and issuance of a land disturbance permit is part of a continuous and ongoing land development process. Expiration of the issued land disturbance permit anticipated in this paragraph, with the permitted work not having been completed, shall result in the property owner or developer, as is applicable, having to comply with that version of the Code that exists at the time of tendering any subsequent land disturbance permit application.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 9-4-2014; Amd. of 12-21-2017(1))

The text of this Code may be amended from time to time only by the board of commissioners.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007)
8-4.3. - Statement of policy.
Amendments to this text will be made only if they bear a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morality or general welfare.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007)

Public hearing. All applications to amend the text of this Code shall receive two public hearings in accordance with the provisions as set forth in article III of this chapter.
(1)
Planning commission recommendation. The planning commission shall make a recommendation to the board of commissioners regarding amending the text of this Code. The planning commission's recommendation shall be in the form of a motion for approval, approval with modifications, or denial. The planning commission shall strive to make a recommendation following the closure of the public hearing; however, the planning commission shall have 31 days from the date of the public hearing to provide its recommendation to the board of commissioners. If the planning commission does not provide a recommendation within the 31 days from the date of the public hearing, the department shall automatically schedule it for consideration by the board of commissioners without the benefit of a recommendation from the planning commission.
(2)
Board of commissioners action. Upon completion of the public hearing and recommendation by the planning commission, or upon expiration of the 31-day time period allowed for the planning commission to provide a recommendation, all amendments to the text of this Code shall be scheduled for a second public hearing by the board of commissioners in accordance with article III of this chapter. The board of commissioners may return it to the planning commission or the department, or both, for further study, or it may approve it. In addition, the board may approve it with modifications, or it may deny it. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the board of commissioners shall have the authority to remove, add to, or edit proposed amendments to the text of this Code that have already been the subject of a recommendation by the planning commission without returning such modifications to the planning commission. In such an event, the board of commissioners shall determine whether an additional public hearing is warranted and, if so, may conduct such public hearing.

The modifications, revisions, or amendments shall include such text providing definitions, specifications, and conditions as may be appropriate to the matter considered, as well as maps delineating any geographical changes. Submissions shall be made to planning commission and the board of commissioners.

8-5.2. - Authority to amend.
The official zoning map may be amended from time to time through the rezoning process only by the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners is also the designated decision making authority on granting conditional use permit, and sketch plat approvals.
(Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012)
8-5.3. - When required.
All rezoning, conditional use permit, and sketch plat applications shall be required in accordance with the following specifications:
(a)
Rezonings. Applications for rezonings shall be required when proposed land use or land development is not in conformance with the existing zoning district.
(1)
Rezonings not permitted. No rezoning shall be made nor accepted by the department involving a request to rezone to the following zoning districts:

Conditional use permits. Applications for conditional use permits shall be required as specified in the uses permitted tables in this Code.
(c)
Home occupations. Applications for home occupations shall be required in accordance with chapter 8, article X, and chapter 16, article III of this Code.
(d)
Sketch plats. Applications for sketch plats afford the director and the board of commissioners an opportunity, prior to construction or build-out of a proposed development, to review a detailed site plan ("sketch plat") of the proposed subdivision or land development in order to ensure development compliance with the Unified Development Code and all other county ordinances and regulations. The sketch plat process is also an opportunity to allow public participation with respect to those developments for which a sketch plat is required. All major subdivisions and any other land development requiring a permit for land disturbance that involves either a tract of land two acres or more, or an area of disturbance two acres or more, shall require the submission of a sketch plat to the director. However, it is not the intent of this Code to require an applicant who already has a site plan that was approved as part of a rezoning or conditional use application, to go through a public review process a second time for the same or substantially the same development. Accordingly, a sketch plat shall not be required for major subdivisions or said land development when the development proposal found by the director is substantially in accordance with the site plan on file in the department. Further, a sketch plat shall not be required if proposed land development is declared a targeted business or extraordinary project, as defined and authorized by section 22-256 of the County Code, and if the board of commissioners ratifies this declaration and authorizes such development to be exempted from the sketch plat process. If a proposed sketch plat does not substantially conform to the site plan on file, or if there is no development plan on file for the subject property, then a sketch plat approval shall be required. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance, the board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing and must approve the sketch plat if required.
(1)
Amendments to approved site plans/architectural elevations/sketch plats. The director is authorized to approve minor amendments to site plans, architectural elevations, and sketch plats. Minor amendments shall include, but are not limited to, adjusting residential lot lines, modifying the layout of internal roads to a subdivision, relocating open space, or applying architectural design standards that are equivalent to or more stringent than those previously approved. Any proposed amendment to a sketch plat that is determined by the director to constitute a public interest, that decreases the amount of open space by ten percent or more, or that increases the density by ten percent or more shall be deemed a major amendment. The relocation of an active amenities area from the interior to the exterior of the property or to a different location on the exterior of the property, reduction in minimum lot size, and change of proposed use shall constitute a major amendment. In addition, any proposed amendment that increases the amount of non-residential, open display or outside storage by ten percent or more or when the proposed amendment entails an expansion of non-residential building(s) by ten percent or more shall constitute a major amendment.

The meeting shall be announced by the public participation letter and the public participation sign. The applicant shall ensure that for any proposal involving a major subdivision or a minimum of 5,000 square feet of non-residential building space, the public participation meeting is audio and visual recorded so as to reasonably capture the discussions and presentation made at the meeting. The audio and video recording shall be tendered to the department with the Public Participation Report.
(d)
Major application change. During the applicant work time, the county acknowledges that there may be various site plan and application changes that result from county staff comments, implementation of the public participation plan or through discussions with the various stakeholders. However, the department also has the responsibility to ensure that an application under review for board consideration, including a site plan, is submitted in conformance with chapter 8, articles II, III and article V of this Code. As such, this section defines the following situations as major application changes that shall require a revised application for zoning review and subsequent public participation meeting or a new application depending on the extent and nature of the proposed change(s).

The staff report will be based upon the general considerations set forth in section 8-5.5(f)(2)a. and the special considerations set forth in section 8-5.5(f)(2)b.
(f)
Public hearing. All rezoning, conditional use permit, and sketch plat applications shall receive a public hearing in accordance with the provisions as set forth in article III of this chapter.

The planning commission shall also receive from the department and review a completed staff report including an analysis, a recommendation, staff recommended zoning conditions as well as review and recommendation of all applicant recommended conditions. Therefore, the planning commission shall have all the information necessary to make a recommendation to the board of commissioners on all applications for rezonings, and conditional use permits. The planning commission's recommendation to the board of commissioners shall be in the form of a motion for approval, approval with conditions or denial. Further, the planning commission may, in acting on said application, recommend a reduction of the land area for which the application is made, recommend a change in the proposed zoning district to a district that is no more intense than the one requested by the applicant, or recommend the addition or deletion of conditions or specifications of the application. The planning commission shall strive to make a recommendation on the application following the closure of the public hearing; however, the planning commission shall have until the next scheduled planning commission regular meeting or 31 days from the date of the public hearing, whichever comes later, to provide its recommendation to the board of commissioners. If the planning commission does not provide a recommendation on rezoning, and conditional use permit applications within this time frame from the date of the public hearing, the department shall automatically schedule the application for consideration by the board of commissioners without the benefit of a recommendation from the planning commission.
(2)
Board of commissioners action on rezonings and conditional use permits. All applications for rezoning and conditional use permits shall be scheduled for consideration by the board of commissioners upon the completion of the public hearing and recommendation by the planning commission or upon expiration of the time period allowed for the planning commission to provide a recommendation. Before taking action on said applications, the board of commissioners shall consider the planning commission's recommendation, if any, the staff report and any application materials forwarded by the department to the board. In addition, the board of commissioners may at its discretion recognize the applicant and consider information submitted by the applicant at the time the board is considering the application. However, if the board permits the applicant to provide testimony or to submit additional materials after the public hearing by the planning commission, in fairness to the public the board of commissioners should open the floor to comments or questions from the general public on the applicant's testimony or additional materials provided in support of the application. The board of commissioners may return the application to the planning commission or the department, or both, for further study or it may approve the application. In addition, the board may approve the application with conditions or it may deny the application. Further, the board may, in acting on said application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the zoning district to a district that is no more intense than the one requested by the applicant, add or delete conditions or specifications of the application, or allow the application to be withdrawn with or without prejudice. Notwithstanding section 8-5.5(e)(1), and for residential zonings only, in the event the applicant requests that the board approve a zoning district that is less intense than the one requested by the application, the applicant shall be required to provide written notification of same to at least the same individuals and entities that were previously notified in accord with section 8-5.5(c)(2)(a) and public participation attendees who provide legible addresses on the sign-in sheet. Such written notice must be provided at least 15 days prior to the application being considered by the board for final action with evidence of such notification provided to the department.
