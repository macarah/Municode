(Ord. No. 505, § I(5-2-19(6)), 6-7-2007)
Sec. 38-208. - General criteria.
(a)
Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the town wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to the town that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. All interceptor units shall of the type and capacity approved by the town.
(b)
Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the town.
(c)
Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the town wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under the town grease management program in the following manner:
(1)
Town will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease control program. The as needed inspection shall be determined by the town.
(2)
Each food service facility in the vicinity of the problem area will be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance records will also be reviewed.
(3)
Following the inspections, the town will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following actions:
a.
Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance.
b.
After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be required to develop and submit to the town proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment.
c.
Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance
(d)
Waste minimization plan. Food service facilities shall develop and implement a waste minimization plan pertaining to the disposal of grease, oils, and food particles.
(e)
Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor.
(f)
Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at anytime. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain line. A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by the town. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible.
(Ord. No. 505, § I(5-2-19(3)), 6-7-2007)
Sec. 38-209. - Design criteria.
(a)
Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the town's plumbing standards and outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the town. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology.
(b)
Access. Outdoor grease interceptors shall be provided with two manholes terminating one inch above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chambers as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer.
(c)
Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas).
(d)
Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
(e)
Interceptor sizing. Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds 3,000 gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two results:
(1)
Interceptor Capacity (gallons) = (S) × (25) × (Hr/12)
S = Number of Seats
Hr=Maximum hours of daily operation (Include preparation & clean up)
(2)

  (f)
Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the town. The town reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
(Ord. No. 505, § I(5-2-19(4)), 6-7-2007)
Sec. 38-210. - Grease interceptor maintenance.
(a)
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
(b)
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by town.
(c)
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the town's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 33 percent of the total depth of the trap, town will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
(d)
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the Town of Tyrone to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.
(e)
Additives. Any additives placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the town. Such additives shall include, but are not be limited to commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein.
(f)
Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.

(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 2, 2-6-2014)
Sec. 38-226. - White lining.
(a)
Background. White lining is a practice that has been widely used in the United States where the National Transportation Board concluded that pre-marking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage. The procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated, such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where. White lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately. In short, pre-marking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate.
(c)
Examples; timing. Examples of areas to be white lined are smaller (involving only a portion of a particular address) or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines, service lines (such as for water, gas, electricity and sewer), utility pits, cuts and repairs, curb repairs, bore holes, directional boring pathways, pole and signage placements, etc. Such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive. White lining shall be completed prior to contacting GA811 to obtain a locate request ticket number. Electronic/virtual white lining shall be clearly marked on submitted documentation within a 20-foot tolerance zone of the proposed excavation site.
(d)
Exceptions to white lining. Exceptions are allowed as follows:
(1)
For large projects as defined in O.C.G.A. § 25-9-3(18), unless one or more utility facilities are damaged three times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90-day contract period, white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with GSPC Rule 515-9-4-.13. A copy of GSPC Rule 515-9-4-.13 currently in effect is attached to Ordinance No. 2014-03 as Exhibit "A" and by this reference is incorporated herein; said exhibit is on file in the town offices. Every contractor begins each large project with zero damages. It is only when three damages (at-fault damages) occur during the 90-day period of the specific large project that the white lining requirement will be triggered. A large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt, as stated above, will be subject to no more than a two-day shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the large project marking facility locating agreement schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon;
(2)
Homeowners/occupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel. Homeowners/occupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business, a contractor, or a utility. Businesses, contractors, and utilities are not exempt from white lining;
(3)
"Emergencies" and "extraordinary circumstances" as such terms are defined herein, are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and, hence, also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section. However, if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance, then the excavator's failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section. Also, pre-excavation emergency locate ticket requests (that is, a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit) will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section;
(4)
Residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential address/parcel requests only; and
(5)
Termite baiting systems.
(e)
White lining symbols as directions to locator. White lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines and/or arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated "START" and "END" of such linear white line. Therefore, it is important to identify the starting and ending points.
(f)
Identification of white lining excavator. In order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process, such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavator's name or the applicable locate ticket number or both.
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 3, 2-6-2014; Ord. No. 2015-05, §§ 1, 2, 8-6-2015)
Sec. 38-227. - Facility marking by or for utilities.
(a)
Utility markings. Facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their UPC alpha code, along with the type material (if known) that the facility consists of, at the beginning and end of locates. Also, arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues. In accomplishing the locate task, the line locator shall use industry-approved and generally accepted methods of locating. The tolerance zone shall be 18 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities.
(1)
To avoid confusion on long runs, the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner.
(2)
The marks shall indicate the approximate center-line of the underground lines. For example, the middle of the cable, line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks.
(3)
Location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet. If the facility to be marked has a greater diameter than 12 inches the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If size is not known, then the mark shall be greater than 12 inches.
(4)
The line locator (person marking the lines) shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area.
(5)
In areas such as flower beds, rock gardens, etc., flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint. The decision to use flags, paint, or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions. For instance, flags or stakes in wet areas, offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks.
(6)
Dead ends, stub-outs, termination points, etc., shall be marked as follows:
(7)
Lines that have connections (e.g., T's or Y's) or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated. Marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection. Marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy.
(8)
Manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible (dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover).
(9)
Facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner.
(10)
Unlocateable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and, if the location of the tap for such unlocateable sewer lateral is known, by placing a green "T" or "Y" or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocateable sewer lateral.
(11)
When facilities share the same trench, they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified. This would apply to lines that share the same color code. For example, cable television and telephone lines:
(12)
If the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If the size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches.
(13)
Duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot.
(14)
In areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed, offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface. However, offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility. Offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark. For example, the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow.
(15)
In areas where cables are spliced, the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice. When the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with "SP" should indicate the area of distortion or "splice pit".

Sec. 38-228. - Facility protection/damage prevention requirements for contractors/excavators/utilities.
(a)
When excavating is to take place within the tolerance zone, the contractor/excavator/utility shall utilize at least one of the following: hand digging, pot holing, soft digging, vacuum excavation methods, pneumatic hand tools, or other mechanical methods that may be developed. Other mechanical methods may be used with the approval of the facility owner or operator.
(b)
Any person involved in an excavation with mechanized equipment found digging or performing land disturbing activities within the "Tolerance Zone" of a facility without evidence of "Potholing" will be found to be in violation of this article.
(c)
The tolerance zone shall be 18 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities.
(d)
White lining is a mandatory practice except as stated in section 38-226(d) (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5).
