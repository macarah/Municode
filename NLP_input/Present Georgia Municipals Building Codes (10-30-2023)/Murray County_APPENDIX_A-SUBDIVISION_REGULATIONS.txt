Culs-de-sac. Lots fronting onto a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum of 35 feet frontage.
4-4-14
Lot area. To provide for the orderly and safe development of property utilizing sewer or on-site sewage management systems, minimum lot sizes have been established. Larger lot sizes may be required to meet the requirements of this rule depending on the proposed development of the property. County zoning authorities may require larger minimum lot sizes; the larger minimum lot sizes will take precedence, except where public sewer is utilized, then county zoning regulations will take precedence.
1.
Lot sizing requirements are as follows for single family dwellings such as manufactured homes, stick built homes, modular homes, etc. on or in subdivisions, manufactured home parks and residential lots at large in the county:
Minimum (Min.) Lot sizes, and Maximum (Max.) allowable Sewage Flow with Types of Water Supply System.

***Slope over 35 percent cannot be utilized for individual sewage disposal systems except in cases where special studies submitted by a registered engineer show that site modifications can overcome slope limitations. Said studies must meet current state guidelines.
  (a)
The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. For each additional bedroom over three, a minimum of 3,000 square feet per bedroom of useable soils area (suitable for use for an individual onsite sewage management system) shall be provided for installation of the individual sewage management system.
(b)
The county board of health will also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features or landscape position.
(c)
Lots shall be a minimum width of 125 feet or 150 feet (single family dwellings and duplexes—125 feet, multi-family—150 feet) in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located.
1.
Where on-site sewage management systems and community or public water are used, minimum lot sizes may be reduced by up to 50 percent. However, no lot should be less than 30,000 square feet. No lot size reduction will be allowed on slopes of greater than 35 percent.
2.
The total area encompassed by the access easement or "panhandle" shall not be included in computing the functional area of the lot for sewage disposal purposes.
3.
Lots utilizing drip emitter systems shall be a minimum of 1½ acres.
4.
The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gallons/acre/day when served by non-public or individual water supply or 1,200 gallons/acre/day when served by a public water/common supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gallons/acre/day as indicated) for a given structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall increased proportionally. All lots must have sufficient unobstructed land area for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved complete replacement system. Lots platted before the adoption of these rules and regulations which do not meet the minimum lot size may be approved provided there is sufficient area available to locate the proposed structure, on-site sewage disposal system, and other appurtenances and the complete replacement of the on-site sewage management system.
(d)
For multi-family units (i.e. duplexes, apartments, etc.) lot size shall be increased by 25 percent for each unit above the initial unit.

4-7-2
Water.
(a)
Accessibility. The provision of a public water supply is deemed by the planning commission to be essential to the public welfare in developments where homes will be in close proximity to each other. When a proposed subdivision is not directly adjacent to an area served by a public water supply system, the planning commission shall determine the accessibility of the nearest system and determine whether the subdivider must make connections. Lands without accessibility to public water supply systems or developments not capable of the provision of an adequate supply of water through an approved system of production, storage, and distribution, capable of providing adequate flow for domestic use and fire protection shall generally be deemed unsuitable for development as a subdivision until such time as this system can be provided.
(b)
Water mains properly connected with the applicable water utility district system shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve all lots shown on the subdivision plat for both domestic use and fire protection.
(c)
Materials and construction procedures for water mains and connections shall be in accordance with basic requirements of the applicable water district.
(d)
Mains of six inches in diameter shall be installed throughout the subdivision; except in the last 500 feet of permanent culs-de-sac, where the water lines must meet the specifications of the governing utility for that situation. Every attempt shall be made to establish a gridiron layout, preferably "looped," with a minimum of dead-end lines. All lines shall meet the specifications of the applicable water utility district.
(e)
Fire protection.
(1)
If fire protection can be provided at the time of platting, in residential areas fire hydrants shall be placed no more than 1,000 feet of road frontage apart and no more than 500 feet of road frontage from the build line of any lot in the subdivision. In commercial areas fire hydrants shall be no less than 500 feet of road frontage apart. They shall be so located that they will be accessible, protected from traffic hazards, and will not obstruct walks, roadways, or parking facilities.
(2)
If fire hydrants are not deemed feasible because of inadequate pressure and flow by the governing water utility at time of platting, then "T's" with caps shall be placed at hydrant locations as specified above. Where a "T" and cap are placed there shall be a valve in the lateral between the road main and the cap. Each "T" and cap shall be marked by a permanent concrete marker.
(3)
All fire hydrants shall have two 2½-inch outlets and one outlet to fit large fire department suction hoses.
(4)
There shall be a valve in the lateral between the road main and fire hydrant.
4-7-3
Sanitary sewers and septic tanks.
(a)
Accessibility. When a proposed subdivision is not directly adjacent to an existing public sewer system, the planning commission shall determine the accessibility of the nearest system and determine whether the subdivider must make connections. The planning commission may seek the advice of other government officials, and/or qualified consultants prior to making this determination. In all cases where the subdivision is within 300 feet of an existing sewer line, and if the city permits them to tie in, connection will be made by the subdivider and a sewer system installed within the subdivision.
(b)
Where the planning commission determines that a subdivision does not have to connect to the existing sewerage system, lots must contain adequate area for the installation of approved septic tank(s) and disposal fields as determined by and approved in writing by the Murray County Environmentalist prior to the plat receiving final approval.
(c)
The sanitary sewer lines shall be at least eight inches in size and in accordance with the instructions and specifications of the applicable public sewer department and the Georgia Environmental Protection Department, and in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with connection to the public system.
4-7-4
Other utilities (gas, electric, telephone, cable TV, etc.)
(a)
Below ground. The Planning Commission shall encourage the complete use of underground utilities wherever practical. These are to be installed in the road right-of-way between the paved roadway and road line to simplify location and repair of lines. The following requirements shall apply: After grading is completed and approved, and before any pavement base is applied, all of the inroad underground work (water, sewer, gas and electric lines and all service connections) shall be completely installed and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. The subdivider should install underground service connections to the property line of each lot within the subdivision for such required utilities before the road is paved.
4-7-5
When a water main is to be located in a road right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the road surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the road base is applied.
4-7-6
Natural gas. When natural gas lines are located in a road right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the road surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to applying the road base.

(b)
That, in the case of failure on the part of the developer to complete the specified improvements within the required time period, the creditor shall pay to the Murray County Commissioner immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of credit stated in the letter.
(c)
That the letter of credit may not be withdrawn, or reduced in amount, until released by the Murray County Land Development Officer.
4-8-2
Time limits. Prior to the granting of final plat approval, the developer and the Murray County Land Development Officer shall agree upon a deadline for the completion of all required improvements, such deadline not to exceed two years from the date of final plat approval. The Murray County Land Development Officer shall have the power to extend that deadline for one additional year where the developer can present substantial reason for doing so.
4-8-3
Release of guarantee. Upon acceptance by the appropriate official of the dedication of the final portion of improvements, the Murray County Land Development Officer shall authorize the release of the letter of credit.
Editor's note— Appendix A, referred to in this section, is not printed herein but is on file in the county offices.
4-9. - Improvement maintenance security.
4-9-1
Maintenance required. The developer/subdivider shall be required to maintain all public improvements in a development for a period of one year from the date of Murray County's acceptance of such infrastructure.
4-9-2
Maintenance security; form and amount. The developer shall post with the Murray County Land Development Officer simultaneously with Murray County's acceptance of such infrastructure an irrevocable letter of credit or other acceptable security in an amount equal to ten percent of the total cost of the public improvements. The purpose of the security is to insure faithful maintenance of said installations and improvements by the developer.
4-9-3
Call for security. If, upon being notified by the Murray County Land Development Officer of failure of required installations or improvements, the developer/subdivider does not correct the deficiency or commence work within ten days of notice, it shall be deemed to be a failure upon the posted security, and the Murray County Commissioner shall have the right to make the necessary repairs, either by public work or by private contract, and the surety, cash deposit and/or escrow account aforesaid shall be liable for the full amount of the cost of said repairs. The ten percent security does not indemnify the developer from costs exceeding the ten percent security during the one year maintenance period. Such overages may be collected as provided by law.
4-9-4
Release of security. At the end of the one year period of time, the developer may formally petition the Murray County Commissioner to release the security.
ARTICLE V. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION

5-1. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to provide flexibility in ensuring preservation of open space within a master-planned residential development. A conservation subdivision design preserves open space while maintaining the prorated density of residential units for the overall site area. Neutral density is achieved by allowing smaller individual owned residential lots in neighborhoods that are surrounded by aesthetically and ecologically important areas. The goal of the design process is to identify and set aside conservation open space areas prior to the delineation of transportation and residential pod layouts. Open space areas include wetlands, river buffer zones, woodlands, playing fields, and meadows, depending on the resources of the land.
5-1-1
The intent of the conservation subdivision regulations is to:
(a)
Preserve significant areas of land for ecological, recreational, and agricultural purposes in perpetuity;
(b)
Encourage more efficient development of land consistent with public health, safety, and general welfare;
(c)
Afford greater flexibility of design and placement of buildings and structures;
(d)
Preserve and protect exceptional terrain, natural beauty, or sites of historic interest from inconsequential placement of homes, roadways, utilities and appurtenances;
(e)
Preserve all the streams and tributaries in Murray County as natural resources;
(f)
Prevent flooding, erosion, and water pollution, and protect the quality and quantity of drinking water;
(g)
Preserve wetlands, aquifers, topographical or soil features, marine and wildlife habitat; and other features having conservation values, including views, vistas, and indigenous vegetation;
(h)
Promote a less sprawling form of development.
5-2. - Procedure.
Conservation subdivisions are allowed as a permitted right in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section, article 5, of the Murray County Subdivision Regulations. Also, the conservation subdivision regulation is a floating zone, which is allowed within residential zoning districts in the presence of any land management regulations for Murray County.
5-3. - Housing density determination.
The number of lots created shall be density neutral. Density neutral is defined as maintaining the number of lots so as not to exceed the number that can be created with the conventional minimum area and width as established in Murray County Subdivision Regulations and any land management regulations.
5-3-1
Number of lots. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
(a)
Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size as determined by the Murray County Environmental Health Department (if septic is needed) or land management regulations for Murray County for a conventional subdivision design plan. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
(1)
Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area.
(2)
The 100-year floodplain.
(3)
Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area.
(4)
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
(b)
Yield plan: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan or plat does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan or plat, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
5-4. - Open space.
5-4-1
Definition. Open space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument (see sections 5-4-6 and 5-4-7).
5-4-2
Standards to determine open space.
(a)
The minimum restricted open space shall comprise at least 40 percent of the gross tract area.
(b)
The following are considered primary conservation areas and are required to be included within the open space, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this article:
(1)
The 100-year floodplain;
(2)
Riparian zones of at least 75 foot width along all perennial and intermittent streams;
(3)
Slopes above 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;
(4)
Wetlands that meet the definition used by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act;
(5)
Populations of endangered or threatened species, or habitat for such species; and
(6)
Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds.
(c)
The following are considered secondary conservation areas and should be included within the open space to the maximum extent feasible:

(5)
Prime agricultural lands of at least five acres contiguous area; and
(6)
Existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas.
(d)
Aboveground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface may be included within the protected open space but cannot be counted towards the 40 percent minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and existing trails may be counted). Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space.
(e)
At least 25 percent of the open space shall consist of land that is suitable for building.
(f)
At least 75 percent of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract. The open space shall adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, other protected areas, and nonprotected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected open space.
(g)
The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Nonadjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space.
5-4-3
Permitted uses of open space. Uses of open space may include the following.
(a)
Conservation of natural, archeological or historical resources;
(b)

(a)
Establishment of a mandatory home owners' association (HOA) to own and maintain the land in common for the open space purposes intended according to the following provisions (see suggestions for the HOA in appendix 5-I):
(1)
With their application for a permit to build a conservation subdivision, developers will create and submit minimum requirements and structure for the HOA before the first lot is sold;
(2)

Building "footprint" locations may not be changed more than 50 feet from preliminary plat to final plat without the Murray County Land Development Officer approval.
5-7. - Appendixes.
APPENDIX 5-I
Suggestions for the home owner's association (HOA):
•
At least one member of the HOA should receive training in wildlife habitat conservation, enhancement, and maintenance.
•
Each homeowner should be given site specific information about indigenous habitat and diversity of species.
•
The HOA should develop a longterm conservation plan for maintenance of common areas. This plan should include examples of environmentally friendly landscaping techniques for homeowners.
APPENDIX 5-II
Suggestions for open space:
•
A minimum of ten percent and a maximum of 50 percent should be used for active recreation, such as playing fields or amenity centers (swim/tennis).
•
Open space in one development should be linked to open space in adjoining developments to create the largest, continuous area of open space possible.
Suggestions for streets:
•
Minimize the number of cul-de-sac streets by providing more than one entrance to the development and interconnect streets as much as possible.
•
For cul-de-sac streets, minimize the amount of impervious surface by limiting the internal turning radius to 20 feet and the width of the paved lane to 16 feet. Use grass and vegetation for the inner circle of turn-arounds, rather than paving the entire area. Declare the HOA responsible for the maintenance of the grassy area in the neighborhood bylaws.
•
Vegetated swales are encouraged in a conservation subdivision plan as an alternative to curb and gutter. Omit curbs wherever possible. This allows runoff from roofs and pavements to pass immediately through grass swales or infiltration basins. Use plant material that will absorb rainwater and act as a natural filter for oil and pollution.
•
Utilize permeable pavement for street surfaces, driveways, sidewalks, and pedestrian and bike paths, except where steep slopes, swelling soils, and other site-specific constraints make it unfeasible. Examples of permeable pavement used in neighborhood developments include permeable crushed stone aggregate, open-celled pavers, porous asphalt, and porous concrete. Wooden decks, paving stones, and wood mulch are recommended for pedestrian areas.
•
Provide marked, paved paths for nonvehicular traffic within the development and connecting to neighboring residential and commercial areas.
APPENDIX 5 - III
EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR BUILDING SITE LOCATIONS
In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be considered by the Murray County Land Development Officer as indicating design appropriate to the site's natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this ordinance. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas. Accordingly, the Murray County Land Development Officer shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan:
1.
Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be approved by the township for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities).
2.
Preserves and maintain mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended, with two exceptions. The first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands which raise an equal or greater preservation concern, as described in [subsections] #5 and #8 below. The second involves predominantly agricultural areas, where remnant trees groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat.
3.
If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a field, as seen from existing public roads. Other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs and wildflowers (specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow).
4.
Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds.
5.
Designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows. Minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres), especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines. Also, woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than ten percent should be avoided. However, woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development. When any woodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal fields, etc.,) in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable.
6.
Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from public roadways. (For example, in open agrarian landscapes, a deep "no-build, no-plant" buffer is recommended along the public roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant.) In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a deep "no-build, no-cut" buffer should be respected, to preserve existing vegetation.
7.
Avoids sitting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking advantage of lower topographic features.
8.
Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the US Environmental Protection Agency and/or by the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory.
9.
Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological or cultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature, including stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar holes, earthworks, burial grounds, etc.
10.
Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerows, etc.
11.
Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac islands, and both sides of new streets with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value.
12.
Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering convenient access by residents, and adequately screened from nearby house lots.
13.
Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable).
14.
Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous, and whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the Design and Management Handbook for Preservation Areas, produced by the Natural Lands Trust. For example, fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development. To the greatest extent practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels, and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems, as per the policies in the open space and recreation element of the township's comprehensive plan.
