Sec. 62. - (Restatement) Arrest warrants.
Be it further enacted, that upon complaint being filed with the mayor, or in his absence or disability to act, the mayor pro tem, by affidavit, or in such other manner as may appear to him sufficient, that any person has violated any municipal ordinance or law of the city, said mayor or mayor pro tem., shall have the power to sign and issue a warrant for the arrest of said offender, which warrant shall be directed to the chief of police, or any member of the police force of the city, and may be executed by said chief or any member of the police force of the city, or the marshal or any watchman of the city or any other person authorized, and empowered to make arrests by the ordinances of the city. Arrest, however, may be made by any of the officers or persons who are thereunto duly authorized as aforesaid, without a warrant if the offense is committed in the presence of the arresting officer, or if the defendant is endeavoring to escape, or if for any other cause there is likely to be a failure of justice for want of an officer to issue a warrant. Arrests by said city officers may likewise be made in the one mile zone lying outside of the city limits as now defined, or as may hereafter be constituted, as provided for in a previous section of this Act [Charter], and likewise the officers of the city may follow violators of the laws and ordinances of the city, and who are endeavoring to escape and arrest them in such flight wherever they may be found in the state.
