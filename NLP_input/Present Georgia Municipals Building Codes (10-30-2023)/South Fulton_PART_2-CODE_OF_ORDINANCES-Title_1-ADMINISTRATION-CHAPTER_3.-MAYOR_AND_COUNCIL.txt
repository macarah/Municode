CHAPTER 3. - MAYOR AND COUNCIL

Sec. 1-3001. - Time, place for meetings; open meetings.
(a)
Unless otherwise noted by the council, all meetings of the council shall be held at: 7:00 p.m. In the event that there is no quorum present at the scheduled starting time for that meeting, the mayor shall wait 30 minutes to see whether a quorum will be present. If a quorum is not obtained after this waiting period, the mayor shall adjourn the meeting and readvertise it in accordance with state law. Meetings are held at 7:00 p.m. on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month unless special circumstances dictate a different meeting date, time, or place. In the event that special circumstances dictate a different meeting date, time, or place, the public shall be duly notified in accordance with O.C.G.A. ยง 50-14-1 et seq., the Georgia Open Meetings Act. The council holds regularly scheduled work sessions commencing at 5:00 p.m. on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month.
(b)
All meetings of the council shall be held in accordance with O.C.G.A. ยง 50-14-1 et seq., the Georgia Open Meetings Act. The public shall be granted access to all meetings at all times except closed executive sessions. The law states that where a quorum of the governing authority or agency thereof are present, and where official action is to be discussed or taken, the meetings must be open and the public granted access.
(Ord. No. 2017-003, ยง 1(2-2001), 4-29-2017; Ord. No. 2017-015, ยง 3, 8-22-2017)
Sec. 1-3002. - Presiding officer and rules for debate.
(a)
Generally. In accordance with the City Charter, the mayor shall preside over meetings of the council, and he or she serves as the presiding officer. In order to ensure a fair, orderly, and efficient meeting, the mayor must enforce the rules of procedure adopted by the council. In the absence of the mayor, the mayor pro tempore shall preside. Where a quorum is present and neither the mayor nor the mayor pro tempore is present, the council may designate an acting presiding officer. Meetings are conducted in accordance with these procedural rules, applicable state law, and Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised. Where a councilmember raises a procedural question and these rules are silent, and in the absence of a specific statute, ordinance, or resolution, the question shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised, so long as the provision used to answer the question is not in violation of local, state or federal laws. The parliamentarian shall advise the mayor on parliamentary inquiries for which such advice is sought.
(b)
Debate. All resolutions, contracts, and items of business which require council approval prior to the expenditure of funds, as well as any other item which requires council action, shall be acted upon by the council only after a councilmember makes a motion and receives a second to the motion. A motion and proper second is recorded by the clerk. Each councilmember, by virtue of his/her election to the council, has the right and obligation to debate any and all issues which come before the council for consideration. However, to ensure an orderly and efficient meeting, each councilmember shall observe the following rules in regards to debate:
(1)
The mayor, as presiding officer (or mayor pro tempore in the mayor's absence), shall call for discussion on an item. No debate on an item should begin until the item has been sounded by the clerk to the council (the clerk), or in the clerk's absence, the mayor's designee.
(2)
Once the item has been properly moved and seconded, the mayor shall call for discussion.
(3)
Thereafter, the mayor shall open debate by recognizing each councilmember who wishes to speak for a period not to exceed ten total minutes, with the additional stipulation that no councilmember shall hold the floor for more than five consecutive minutes of their allotted time. However, at the opening of each council meeting, a councilmember may ask their colleagues to waive the normal time limits on issues they deem need more time. The council will vote on each request before the agenda begins and decide among themselves what additional amount of time to allot to each councilmember. The clerk shall be the official timekeeper for the council.
(4)
If a councilmember believes that debate on an issue is too lengthy or that a vote should be called for immediately on an issue, he or she can "call the question" or "move the previous question." This motion is out of order if it is made while another councilmember has the floor or if the maker of the motion is not recognized by the mayor. This is a motion that is not debatable and requires a second. Once the motion has been properly made and seconded, the mayor shall immediately stop debate on the issue being debated and announce that there is a call the question motion on the floor. Immediately thereafter, the mayor shall call for a vote on the call the question motion, not on the main motion. If the call the question motion fails, debate on the issue may continue, and then the mayor may allow debate on the issue to resume. If it passes, the mayor must immediately call for a vote on the issue which was the subject of the call the question motion.
(5)
Any action by the council, including final action on applications for changes in land use status, but excluding a reconsideration of any action previously considered, i.e., motions to adjourn, motions to suspend the rules, an affirmative vote to lay on the table, or to take from the table, shall be subject to a motion to reconsider. After a motion to reconsider is made, a motion to rescind must also be made. After the motion to rescind is made, the matter would be appropriate for an additional passed motion and discussion thereon. Such motions can only be made by a member of the prevailing side on the original action. A motion to reconsider may be made immediately after it fails to prevail but in no case can it be made any later than the next scheduled council meeting. A motion to reconsider is debatable only if the action being reconsidered is debatable. Upon passage of a motion to reconsider, the subject matter shall be considered anew without regard to previous council action. No reconsideration can be made on a zoning request at a subsequent meeting.
(6)
Any zoning matter which is deferred or on which discussion is otherwise postponed by the council shall be heard at the next appropriate scheduled zoning meeting. Zoning matters are heard only on the first meeting of the month, in accordance with a schedule set by the director of developmental services. Ordinarily, no new zoning cases are heard in January.
(c)
Quorum. A quorum must be present for the transaction of business of the council. In accordance with the Georgia law, four of the seven elected councilmembers must be present to constitute a quorum. It is the duty of the mayor to enforce this rule. Any councilmember may raise a point of order if that councilmember believes that a quorum is not present. If during the course of a meeting a quorum is lost, the council cannot transact business. If, however, members of the council are in the councilmembers' conference room adjacent to the assembly hall and are able to hear the business of the council through the public address system, the council has not lost a quorum. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the mayor must adjourn the meeting.
(d)
Duties and privileges of the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall preserve order and decorum, and shall immediately speak to points of order and shall decide all questions of order, subject to appeal. In case of any disturbance or disorderly conduct, the presiding officer shall have the power to require the chamber to be cleared or request that the sergeant at arms (chief of police and or the designee) remove those individuals ruled by the chair as being out of order. In the event the chair fails to rule individuals out of order that are causing a disturbance, any member of council may call for a point of order and present a motion to have the individual ruled out of order and to instruct the sergeant of arms to remove those individuals ruled as out of order. The motion to remove will require a two-thirds vote. The presiding officer shall require the observation of rules of conduct to protect the rights of all councilmembers and citizens.
(e)

The council holds regular meetings on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month. Work sessions of the council are held on the same days. Regular meetings commence at 7:00 p.m., and work sessions commence at 5:00 p.m. All times are Eastern Standard Time. The agenda is prepared at the direction of the mayor and by the clerk's office in concert with the city manager's office. The deadline for submitting items for regularly scheduled council meetings to the clerk's office for inclusion on the next agenda is 10:00 a.m. on Friday prior to the meeting. A final copy of the agenda is distributed to the councilmembers, city attorney, city manager and appropriate staff by 2:00 p.m. on the Friday preceding the scheduled meeting of the council. Copies are also made available to the public at that time. A post agenda is provided after the meeting. The post agenda is a precursor to the final minutes and reflects actions taken by the council at a particular meeting. Post agendas/preliminary minutes are distributed by the clerk's office within 48 hours of a meeting.
(2)
The agenda preparation procedure is as follows:
a.
To have an item placed on the agenda for consideration at a city council work session meeting, it must be submitted electronically for consideration to the city clerk by 12:00 p.m. (noon) on the Wednesday immediately preceding the work session date. Any supporting documents germane to the item should also be submitted. To have an item placed on the agenda for consideration at a city council regular monthly meeting, it must be timely submitted for consideration at the city council work session which precedes such regular monthly meeting.
b.
Adding of items to the agenda during the meeting is disfavored. Where there is a showing of an emergency or extraordinary circumstances exist, an item may be added to the agenda when it is adopted during the meeting by four affirmative votes. A motion shall be properly made and must carry to add each item to the agenda on the day of the meeting. That item shall appear on the post agenda under the "added during the meeting" heading.
c.
Under the public comment section of the agenda, members of the public may be placed on the agenda to discuss a particular item of importance. To do so, the member of the public should first contact the office of the county manager who will ensure that the relevant department heads and other individuals have been contacted in an attempt to resolve the issue. In the event that the issue cannot be resolved by the county manager in consultation with the department heads, the citizen may then contact any councilmember so that councilmember may place that person on the agenda. The councilmember should then inform the clerk by memorandum stating the subject to be discussed, the person who will discuss it, a contact address, and a phone number for the person who will discuss the matter. Any supporting material germane to the item being discussed should also be submitted.
d.
Whenever any agenda item, via resolution, seeks council approval of a written agreement, a copy of the written agreement shall be attached to the agenda item or resolution and shall be distributed by the clerk as with other agenda items. Upon approval of the item, the clerk shall include a copy of the written agreement in the official minutes of the council meeting at which such approval occurred.
(h)
Consent agenda. The council uses a consent agenda which lists items of routine nature, such as renewal of grants, subdivision confirmations, refund reports, etc. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and for which debate is not expected, should be placed on the consent agenda. Items may be removed from the consent agenda for further discussion, but may not be added. The consent agenda is adopted with one motion.
