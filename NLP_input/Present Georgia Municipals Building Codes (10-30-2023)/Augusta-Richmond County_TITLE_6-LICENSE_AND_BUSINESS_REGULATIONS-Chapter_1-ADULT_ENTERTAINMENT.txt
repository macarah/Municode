Editor's note— Ord. No. 6607 , § 1, adopted April 1, 2003, amended Ch. 1, §§ 6-1-1—6-1-27 in its entirety. Formerly, said chapter pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 6532 , § 1, 7-18-02; Ord. No. 6540 , § 1, 8-6-02.

Sec. 6-1-1. - Findings; public purpose.
Based on the experience within Augusta, neighboring counties and in reliance on studies by the Cities of St. Marys, Georgia, Austin, Texas, Amarillo, Texas, Beaumont, Texas, Indianapolis, Indiana, Los Angeles, California, Phoenix, Arizona, St. Paul, Minnesota, Garden Grove, California, and Tucson, Arizona, which experiences and studies have been found by the Augusta-Richmond County Commission to be similar to the problems faced by Augusta, Georgia and in further reliance on federal case law reciting findings on the issue, the Commission takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country. Moreover, it is the finding of the Commission that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, and the display and sale of material distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting, describing, or related to specified sexual activities or specific anatomical areas for observation and purchase by patrons therein, particularly in adult entertainment establishments, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with public nudity, adult bookstores and adult entertainment establishments are disorderly conduct, prostitution, child molestation and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with public nudity, adult bookstores and adult entertainment establishments are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas, and the resultant difficulty in fostering economic and community development in the surrounding neighborhood. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in adult entertainment establishments and the regulation of adult entertainment establishments are in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with adult entertainment establishments.
The Augusta-Richmond County Commission hereby declares that the purpose of this Chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities and undesirable community conditions frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this Chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
