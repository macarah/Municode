(b)
Signatures. No assessment shall be made against abutting property, unless the same is consented to in writing by the owners of fifty-one (51) percent of the property abutting such improvements.

A final decision means the approval or denial of the petition by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. No. 31-03, Pt. I, 11-25-03)
Sec. 23-94. - Funding.
(a)
Assessment. Each owner of property abutting the sidewalks shall be assessed a share of the cost to be funded by the district, which cost shall be added to the ad valorem property taxes for each owner as provided in this section. No assessment shall be made against abutting property, unless the same is consented to in writing by the owners of fifty-one (51) percent of the property abutting such improvements. Abutting shall mean adjacent to, contiguous with, or adjoining.
(b)
Pro rata costs. Each property owner's share of the cost shall be determined as follows: The total cost of the project shall be calculated by the county, and the figure so derived shall be known as the total project cost. The county shall next determine the linear feet of sidewalk that was constructed. The total cost shall then be divided by the total linear feet of sidewalk to derive the cost per foot. Each property owner abutting the sidewalks shall then be assessed an amount that equals the linear feet of street frontage the property owner has multiplied by the cost per foot.
(c)
Payment. The sidewalk tax assessment shall be paid by one (1) of two (2) options, as follows:
(1)
Option one. The assessment may be paid in cash by the property owner within ninety (90) days of the mailing of the assessment by the county. If paid under this option, the assessment will not bear an administrative fee and no lien shall be recorded against the property. Payment shall be made to "DeKalb County" and delivered to the public works department. If payment is not made in full within ninety (90) days of the county's initial billing of the assessment, then payment option two shall automatically take effect. Once option two is in effect, the payment via option two shall be the property owner's sole option until all assessment payments are satisfied.
(2)
Option two. The assessment shall be paid in five (5) equal annual installments. Payment of each such assessment shall be due and payable within sixty (60) days from the mailing by regular mail of a bill from the tax commissioner. In the event option two is selected, the cost of processing, administration, recording the lien, and satisfaction of such lien shall be added to the assessment.
(d)
The property owner shall advise any purchaser of its property within the sidewalk district of the assessment. The property owner may conduct a proration of the assessment with the purchaser. The county shall not be responsible for the proration of the assessments between sellers and purchasers nor shall the county be under any duty to notify any purchaser of the existence or liability for the assessment.
(e)
If the assessment is not paid when due, the assessment shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent ad valorem taxes and shall be subject to the same interest and penalties.
(f)
The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recorded by the tax commissioner in the lien records of the clerk of the county superior court.
(g)
The fee for processing and administration of this option shall be established by the tax commissioner and approved by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. No. 31-03, Pt. I, 11-25-03)
