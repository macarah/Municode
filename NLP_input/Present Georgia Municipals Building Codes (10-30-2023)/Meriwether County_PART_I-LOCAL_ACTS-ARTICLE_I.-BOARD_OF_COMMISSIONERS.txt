Sec. 1. - Creation of board.
(a)
The board of commissioners of Meriwether County shall consist of five members. The members of the board who are in office on July 1, 1997, shall continue in office and shall serve until December 31, 1998, and until their successors are elected and qualified. Successors to such members shall be elected at the general election in 1998. Those persons elected to the first, third, and fifth districts shall be elected quadrennially thereafter. Those persons elected to the second and fourth districts shall serve a term of two years until December 31, 2000, and those elected thereafter shall be elected quadrennially thereafter. Each member of the board shall represent one of the five commission districts described in subsection (d) of this section; and the member representing each commission district shall be elected solely by the electors who reside in that commission district.
(b)
Each candidate for election to the board of commissioners shall, at the time of qualification for election, be a resident of the commission district he or she seeks to represent. The office of any member of the board who ceases to be a resident of the commission district he or she represents shall become vacant by operation of law as of the date of change of residency.
(c)
After the general election to fill the next term of office for Districts 2 and 4, said election being in November, 1998, and expiring on December 31, 2000, the terms of all members of the board for every district shall be for four years beginning on the first day of January next following their election and until their successors are elected and qualified.
(d)
For the purpose of electing members of the board of commissioners of Meriwether County, the county shall be divided into five commissioner districts as follows:
