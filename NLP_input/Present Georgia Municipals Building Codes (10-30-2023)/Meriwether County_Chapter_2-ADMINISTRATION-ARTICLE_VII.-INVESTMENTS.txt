(2)

(3)
Jail fund.
(4)
Capital project fund.

Sec. 2-196. - Investment criteria.
(a)
Safety. Preservation of principal shall always be the foremost objective in any investment transaction involving county funds. Those individuals investing funds on the county's behalf must first ensure that capital losses are avoided by limiting credit and interest risk. Credit risk is the risk that market value portfolios will fall due to an increase in general interest rates.
(b)
Liquidity. The second objective shall be the maintenance of sufficient liquidity within the investment portfolio. The county's investment portfolio shall be structured such that securities mature at the time when cash is needed to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Additionally, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should maintain some securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity).
(c)
Return on investment. The third objective shall be the realization of competitive investment rates, relative to the risk being assumed. However, yield on the county's investment portfolio is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above.
(Code 1991, § 2-251; Ord. No. 2011-06, 10-25-2011)
Sec. 2-197. - Delegation of authority.

The finance director is designated as the investment director for the county and is authorized to make all appropriate investment decisions within the scope of those policies. The finance director shall maintain a standard of prudence in accord with the "prudent person rule" that all investment decisions will be made with the judgment and care a person of intelligence and prudence would exercise in the administration of his own affairs.
