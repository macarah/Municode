[Exhibit A]
COUNTY ATTORNEY MEMO AS REFERRED TO IN SECTION 2-13-44
TO: Board of Commissioners
FROM: Tom Lee, County Attorney
SUBJECT: Street Closings
The law of the State of Georgia recognizes three types of roadways:
(a)
Fee-simple roadway under which complete title is vested in Glynn County. The County actually has a deed to the road bed and the adjoining right-of-way. If the road is closed, Glynn County has to dispose of the real property at public sale.
(b)
Easement-type roadway where the public has no title but merely an easement. The adjacent land owners own the ground underneath the road right-of-way.
(c)
Conditionally owned roadway is where the County owns the road right-of-way, but the right-of-way reverts to the owner if the County ceases using the right-of-way for road purposes.
For the last couple of years, Glynn County has been requiring that streets and roads and the accompanying right-of-ways be deeded to Glynn County. Therefore, the County has fee simple title to the roadway and the ground underneath the roadway. However, most of the roads in subdivisions, developed prior to 1978 or 1979, are easement type roads. Accordingly, the legal title to the ground underneath the road right-of-way belongs to the adjoining lot owners.
If an easement road is no longer used as a road, it can not be diverted to some other public purpose such as a parking lot, recreational area, etc. The rule may or may not apply to fee simple roads owned by Glynn County.
In order for a road to be closed, the Board of Commissioners must determine that all or part of the road has ceased to be used by public so as to no longer serve any substantial useful purpose. This decision is made by the adoption of a resolution which is then recorded on the minutes of the Board of Commissioners. Owners of property located on the road must first be notified of the impending resolution prior to its passage by the Board of Commissioners. A road cannot be closed for the purpose of helping a private landowner. The closing must serve some public purpose such as relieving the public from the charge of maintaining a road or street, or the street or road are no longer useful or convenient to the public. There are several factors which should be considered by the Board of Commissioners in deciding whether or not to close a road or street. These factors are hereinafter set out.
A.
Source of Title. Does Glynn County own fee simple title to the road/street or merely an easement for use by public for road purposes?
B.
Present Use of Road, Street or Alley.
1.
General public;
2.
Limited use by a small group; or
3.
Location of public utilities.
C.
Past History. What use has been made of the road/street in the last 20 years?
D.
Potential Need in the Future.
1.
Growth area.
2.
Transportation studies.
E.
Cost Involved in Opening Road/Street.
1.
Obstructions.
2.
Attorneys fees and court costs.
(Glynn County is under no legal obligation to open a road.)
F.
Availability of Other Means of Travel.
1.
Public
2.
Adjoining landowners.
3.
Neighborhood.
4.
Emergency vehicles.
5.
Garbage pick-up.
G.
Benefit to Public in Continuing Public Usage.
H.
Benefit to Public in Closing Road.
In order to establish a procedure which will be employed in a consistent manner, I believe, prior to the closing or opening of any platted road, the question as to a particular road should be referred to the Joint Planning Commission "Staff", Public Works Department, and County Engineer's Office for their written comment, prior to any action being taken by the Board of Commissioners.

Reports will include the address(es) of the area and the time that the spill occurred. Failure by any individual, firm, business, or corporation to respond to a spill or leak within two hours from the time that the spill or leak occurred or from receiving notification from the County may result in a minimum $500.00 fine.
