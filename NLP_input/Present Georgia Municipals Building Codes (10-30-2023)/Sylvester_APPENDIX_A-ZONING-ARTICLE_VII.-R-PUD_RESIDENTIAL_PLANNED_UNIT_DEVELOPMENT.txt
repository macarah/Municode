ARTICLE VII. - R-PUD RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT

Section 7.01. - Residential planned unit developments [statement of purpose.]
The objective of the [R-PUD residential] planned unit development is to encourage ingenuity, imagination, and flexibility of design efforts on the part of builders, architects, site planners, and developers to produce land developments which are in keeping with density and open space objectives of the zoning resolution, while departing from the strict application of use, setback, height, and minimum lot size requirements of the zoning ordinance. The intent of this section [article] is to permit such flexibility and provide performance criteria for planned developments which:
A.
Permits a creative approach to the residential development.
B.
Provides for an efficient use of land potentially resulting in more economical networks of streets and utilities, thereby lowering housing and other land development costs.
C.
Enhances the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of natural features, the provision of recreation areas and open space.
D.
Provides an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding residential areas and other areas of the City of Sylvester.
Section 7.02. - Permitted uses.
In all R-PUD developments, no building or land, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, shall be erected or used, except for one or more of the following specified uses:
A.
One[-family], two[-family], and multifamily dwelling units, including townhouse dwellings.
B.
Mobile home parks.
C.
Recreational facilities.
D.
Churches, and community clubs.
E.
Schools.
F.
Other governmental functions.

Minimum size. The minimum size of a planned unit development shall be three acres.
C.

Each two square feet of existing and/or natural water surface, periodically flooded (based upon the 100-year flood contour elevation), or inundated land may be credited as one square foot of land area for required open area. Land below the 100-year flood elevation can only be substituted for one-half of the required open space or common areas.
B.
Common open space must be used for amenity or recreation purposes and must be suitably improved for its intended use. Common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures, and improvements which are permitted in the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open space and must conserve and enhance the amenities of the common open space having regard to its topography and unimproved condition. Open space shall not be interpreted to include rights-of-way, easements, paved areas, and pending area of service areas.
