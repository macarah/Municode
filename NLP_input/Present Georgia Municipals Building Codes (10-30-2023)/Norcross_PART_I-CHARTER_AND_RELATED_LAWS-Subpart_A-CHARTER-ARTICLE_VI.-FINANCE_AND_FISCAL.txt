Sec. 6.11. - Property tax levy.
The city council shall assess and collect an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property within the corporate limits of the city as permitted by state law for the purpose of raising revenues to defray the costs of operating the city government, of providing governmental services, for the repayment of principal and interest on general obligations, and for any other public purpose as determined by the city council in its discretion.

Sec. 6.13. - Occupational and business taxes.
The city council by ordinance shall have the power to levy such occupation or business taxes as are not prohibited by law.

The city council by ordinance shall have the power to require any individuals or corporations who transact business in this city or who practice or offer to practice any profession or calling therein to obtain a license or permit for such activity from the city and pay a reasonable fee for such license or permit where such activities are not now regulated by general law in such a way as to preclude city regulations. Such fees may reflect the total cost to the city of regulating the activity and, if unpaid, shall be collected as provided in section 6.19 of this Charter.

If unpaid, said sewer service shall constitute a lien against any property of persons served, which lien shall be second in priority to liens for county and city property taxes and shall be enforceable in the same manner and under the same remedies as a lien for city property taxes as provided in section 6.19 of this Charter.
Sec. 6.16. - Sanitary and health service charges.

Such authority shall include the power to assess, levy and collect annual or monthly sanitary taxes or fees in such amount, or amounts, and based upon and in accordance with such classification of property and sanitary service or services provided, as may be fixed by ordinance. Said sanitary taxes and assessment thereof shall be a charge and lien against the real estate in respect to which said taxes are so assessed and the owner or owners thereof, superior to all other liens except liens for county and city property taxes and shall be enforceable in the same manner and under the same remedies as a lien for city property taxes as provided in section 6.19 of this Charter.
Sec. 6.17. - Special assessments.
The city council, by ordinance, shall have the power and authority to assess and collect impact fees or other special assessment fees to cover all or part of the cost of constructing, reconstructing or improving any public way, street, sidewalk, curbing, gutters, sewers, water systems or other utility mains and appurtenances, against the abutting property owner or the owners of any property having a constitutionally sufficient nexus to the needed public improvement under such reasonable terms and conditions as may be prescribed by ordinance. Such special assessments shall become delinquent 30 days after their due dates, shall thereupon be subject, in addition to fieri facias charges, to a penalty of 10 percent and shall thereafter be subject to interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum from date due until paid. A lien shall exist against the affected property superior to all other liens, except that it shall be of equal dignity with liens for county and city property taxes; and said lien shall be enforceable by the same procedure and under the same remedies as a lien for city property taxes as provided in section 6.19 of this Charter.
Sec. 6.18. - Construction; other taxes.
This city shall be empowered to levy any other tax allowed now or hereafter by law, and the specific mention of any right, power or authority in this article shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of this city to govern its local affairs.
Sec. 6.19. - Collection of delinquent taxes and fees.
The city council, by ordinance, may provide for the collection of delinquent taxes, fees, or other revenues due the city under Sections 6.10 through 6.18 of this Charter by fieri facias issued by the General Government Administration department and executed by any police officer of the city or the city marshal under the same procedure provided by the law governing execution of such process from the superior court or by the use of any other available legal processes and remedies. The city council shall be authorized to impose an interest penalty upon delinquent tax payments to the city in an amount not exceeding the maximum rate of interest allowable under the laws of Georgia. A lien shall exist against all property upon which the city property taxes are levied, as of the assessment date of each year, which lien shall be superior to all other liens, except that it shall have equal dignity with those of federal, state, or county taxes. In case of hardship, the city council shall have discretionary authority to waive any and all penalties imposed by this Charter on delinquent taxes, assessments, or on other amounts due to the city.
