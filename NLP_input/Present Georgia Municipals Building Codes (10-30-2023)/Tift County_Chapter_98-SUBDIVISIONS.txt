(6)
Water and sewer: A statement from the subdivider shall be submitted with the preliminary plat which will describe the method by which sanitary sewer and water facilities will be provided. If non-public sewer is proposed to serve a subdivision, then soils will be identified by an approved soils scientist and soils percolation test results and contour map shall accompany the preliminary plat at the time of submission. The contour map shall show location and identification of each soil class and site of each percolation test. Percolation tests shall be made in accordance with county health department requirements.

(e)
Approval by individual agencies: No preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission unless it is approved by the director of roads and public works and the commissioner of health. Said agencies shall, with or without modification, approve or disapprove the preliminary plat to the extent that each has jurisdiction. If the plat is rejected, the respective reviewing agency shall provide the planning commission with a written statement specifying all aspects where the plat fails to comply.
(f)
Staff development review committee: Upon receipt of the filing of the preliminary plat, the zoning administrator shall prepare those materials for presentation to the staff development review committee. The staff development review committee shall review the preliminary plan for technical compliance with the Tift County Land Subdivision Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive Plan, and other county ordinances that might impact on the proposed land subdivision. The staff development review committee shall recommend in writing, approval, conditional approval, postponement or disapproval within 30 days of submission.
(g)
Coordination: It shall be the responsibility of the zoning administrator to insure that the respective reviews of the director of roads and public works and staff development review committee are brought together in a timely fashion for proper presentation to the planning commission.
(h)
Review by planning commission: The planning commission shall review the preliminary plat, giving due consideration to the reviews of the staff development review committee and the director of roads and pubic works. The planning commission shall then recommend to the Tift County Commission for preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement or disapproval within 30 days of submission. If after 30 days the planning commission has failed to act, the preliminary plat will be forwarded to the Tift County Commissioners for their action, unless the subdivider may waive in writing this requirement and consent to an extension of such period.
(i)
Review by county commission: Final review of the proposed preliminary subdivision plat shall be made by the county commission at their next regular meeting. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for coordination of information to be brought before the county commission, which at a minimum shall include the recommendations of the staff development review committee, the director of roads and public works, the commissioner of health, and the recommendation of the planning commission. The county commission may grant preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement of disapproval within 30 days of submission.
(1)
Preliminary approval by the county commission means that the developer is now authorized to proceed with the preparation of the required improvement plans, outlined in detail under section 4-2. No developer shall proceed with any construction or any other work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining preliminary approval of these improvement plans in writing. Lots shall not be sold nor shall building construction begin at this time. Preliminary approval grants the developer a maximum time of 18 months within which he shall submit his improvements plan and final plat for approval unless a time extension is granted by the county commission before the expiration of the 18-month period. If such time extension is granted, it shall be for not more than 12 additional months. Failure to submit improvements plan and final plat within this time period, including extension if any, shall invalidate preliminary plat approval, and require resubmission of preliminary plat. Additionally, if, in the opinion of the staff development review committee, substantial changes have been made to the approved preliminary plat, the revised plat shall be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat.
(2)
Conditional approval by the county commission means the developer may proceed after written notice from the zoning administrator, as outlined under "preliminary approval" but only after he has submitted at least five copies of the corrected preliminary plan to the zoning administrator, noting thereon the condition or changes required by the approval of the county commission.
(3)
Postponement by the county commission means action is delayed for specific reasons which shall be noted and transmitted in writing to the developer by the zoning administrator. Postponed preliminary plans may be reconsidered by the county commission without resubmittal to the staff development review committee, the director of roads and public works, the commissioner of health and the planning commission.
(4)
Disapproval by the county commission means denial of the application for subdivision because the developer's plans are not in compliance with this article. For further consideration, the developer must rework and resubmit his plans as though they were a completely new preliminary plan. The specific reasons for disapproval shall be stated to allow for correction.
(Ord. No. 98-02, 6-8-98)
Sec. 98-33. - Improvement plans.
(a)
General requirements: Subdivision plans receive their second official consideration as "improvement plans."

Should such services be required, such plans shall reflect the engineer or consultant's state registration.
(c)
Filing: To secure formal review of his improvement plans, the developer shall file with the zoning administrator three certified (signed and sealed by the developer's registered consultant) white background prints of the improvement plans.

(1)
Approval means the developer is now authorized to proceed with the physical improvements in the subdivision, after securing any required construction permits, and may proceed with the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
(2)
Conditional approval means the developer may proceed as outlined in the preceding paragraph, but only after he submits three certified copies of the corrected improvement plans to the director of roads and public works for his review and approval.
(3)

(d)
Plans and data required for improvement plan submission: The plans for the required public improvements shall be prepared for the approval by the staff development review committee and director of roads and public works prior to the construction and only after approval of the preliminary plan. Such improvement plans shall show the proposed locations, sizes, types, grades and general design features of each facility, and shall be based on reliable field data. Construction plan approvals are good for 24 months. If the subdivision is sold prior to completion and final platting, a mandatory review by the staff development review committee and director of roads and public works is required. Failure to comply may result in revocation of construction permit after notice and hearing before the staff development review committee. The developer shall receive a minimum of ten days written notice of said hearing.

At the end of the 24-hour period, the treated water in all portions of the main shall have a residual of not less than 10 mg/L free chlorine. Rechlorinate if required results are not obtained on all samples.
8.
After the applicable retention period, the heavily chlorinated water must not be disposed in a manner that will harm the environment. Neutralizing chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite or sodium thiosulfate can be used to neutralize the chlorine residual remaining in the water to be wasted.
9.
Flush all lines until residual is equal to existing system. After final flushing and before the water main is placed into service, water samples shall be collected from the main and tested for microbiological quality in accordance with the Georgia Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Chapter 391-3-5. The laboratory results must show the absence of coliform organisms in the water. Reflush and redisinfect the lines, as necessary, until satisfactory bacteriological results are obtained.

Special structural support for the water and sewer pipes may be required.
2.
When local conditions prevent a vertical separation of 18 inches, the sewer passing over or under water mains shall be constructed of materials and with joints that are equivalent to water main standards of construction and shall be pressure tested to assure water-tightness prior to backfilling.
3.
When water mains cross under sewers, additional measures shall be taken by providing:
(i)
A vertical separation of at least 18 inches between the bottom of the sewer and the top of the water main;
(ii)
Adequate structural support for the sewers to prevent excessive deflection of joints and settling on and breaking the water mains;
(iii)
The length of water pipe be centered at the point of crossing that the joints will be equidistant and as far as possible from the sewer; and

b.
At high points in water mains where air can accumulate, provisions shall be made to remove the air by means of hydrants or air relief valves. Automatic air relief valves shall not be used in areas where flooding of the manhole or chamber may occur.
c.

Valves should be located at not more than 500 foot intervals in commercial districts and at not more than one block or 800 foot intervals in other districts. Where systems serve widely scattered customers, the valve spacing should not exceed 4,000 feet.
g.
Valves shall meet the current AWWA Standards.
(g)
Fire fighting.
(1)
Fire hydrant flow. Aside from the general purpose of delivering water for fire fighting, the fire hydrant must be based on a number of operational elements. Some issues to consider include:
a.
How much water (GPM or L/min) is needed for fire fighting.
b.
How many and what size hose connections are required.
c.
The established hose sizes and coupling threads in the region.
d.
Current (and future) configuration of fire apparatus.
e.
Issues of clearance and visibility.
f.
Operating characteristics of the hydrants.
g.
Amount of head (static pressure) that is present in the system.
h.
Climatic conditions in the area.
Generally speaking, water supply systems in residential areas should be designed to deliver no less than 1,000 GPM (3,785 L/min) at each individual hydrant. In commercial and multistory apartment zones, this volume should increase based on the required fire flows for the buildings being protected. If the required fire flows are several thousand GPM, the required flow will usually have to be met by two or more hydrants flowing simultaneously.
(2)
Design criteria. While there are numerous published minimum standards, design criteria for water systems should be based upon the expected service needs over the life of a particular system. Storage and water delivery capacities should include peak domestic consumption combined with peak anticipated fire flows. Storage capacity should be sufficient to hold two days' peak domestic use plus a minimum of two hours of peak fire flow in ordinary hazard zones, and a minimum of three hours (or greater) in high hazard zones.
Calculations for pipe sizing should take into account a minimum of 50 years subsequent community growth and its increased demands on the system. Over the life of a system it is less costly to install a proper system that has sufficient capacity for future community needs than it is to remove and replace pipes every few years.
(3)
Water tanks and storage reservoirs. Water for fire fighting should be provided by gravity storage wherever possible. Using elevation as the means for developing proper water pressure in water mains and hydrants is reliable, not dependent on pumps that could fail or be shut down as a result of an electrical outage. Storage can be provided through one or more large storage reservoirs or by multiple smaller reservoirs throughout the community that are linked together. In determining the desired storage tank elevation, one can assume that every foot of head will produce 0.434 psi of pressure (1 meter of elevation will produce 9.813 kPa). Therefore to generate 65 psi (450 kPa) in the water distribution system, storage tanks must be located at an elevation of approximately 150 feet (45 meters) above the service area. Adequate system pressures are generally accepted to be between 65 and 85 psi (450 and 585 kPa). Accordingly, storage tanks should be placed at elevations between 150 and 200 feet (45 and 60 meters) above serve areas. Since most communities are not perfectly flat, there will be some variation in service pressure. While it may not be possible to establish a storage tank elevation to service most of a hilly community, it is often possible to design a system where the majority of the community falls within the 65 to 85 psi (450 and 585 kPa) range with pressures in some portions experiencing less desirable but acceptable ranges as low as 50 psi (345 kPa) and as high as 120.
(h)
Street crossings. Open cutting of streets shall be allowed only where permitted by the county engineer. At locations where open cutting is not permitted, the crossing shall be made by boring or tunneling. Crossings may be boring or tunneling shall require a casing pipe unless otherwise approved by the county engineer. All work and materials shall be in conformity with all requirements of the technical specifications of Tift County. The diameter and length of the casing pipe to be used shall be as determined by the county engineer. All temporary surfacing shall consist of cold-mix asphalt at a minimum.
(1)
Borings without casing pipe shall be a maximum size of two-inch pipe. Borings without casing pipe is used only with the recommendation of the design engineer and approval of the county engineer. Sand shall be blown into the bore hole to fill the remaining voids.
(2)
Fire flow requirements. Public improvement plans for waterline projects serving development sites other than single-family or duplex subdivisions shall be reviewed for fire protection sufficiency as determined by the fire marshall for Tift County. The fire marshall shall determine the amount of water that is required for fire protection based on I.S.O. guidelines for the proposed type of structures to be built within the development. The design engineer shall obtain the flow requirement and then determine if the existing and proposed waterlines can provide this flow based on existing operating conditions. Calculations verifying that the required flows can be met shall accompany the drawings when submitted for approval.
(i)
Water supply.
(1)
Credit for the water system. For maximum credit in the schedule, the needed fire flows should be available at each location in the district. Needed fire flows of 2,500 gpm and less should be available for two hours, 3,000 and 3,500 gpm for three hours and all others for four hours. See the table at subsection (4).
All AWWA standard hydrants within 1,000 feet of a building, measured as hose can be laid by apparatus, are credited; 1,000 gpm for hydrants within 300 feet; 670 gpm for 301 to 600 feet; and 250 gpm for 601 to 1,000 feet. Credit is reduced when hydrants lack a pumper outlet, and is further reduced when they only have only a single 2½-inch outlet.
(2)
Credit for hydrants. For maximum credit in the schedule, all hydrants should have a pumper outlet, six-inch or larger branch connection, uniform size operating nut and should operate in a uniform direction.
(3)
Credit for inspection and condition of hydrants. For maximum credit in the schedule, all hydrants should be inspected twice a year, the inspection should include operation and a test at domestic pressure. Records should be kept of the inspections. Hydrants should be conspicuous, well located for use by a pumper, and in good condition.
(4)
Calculation of needed fire flow (NFFi).
NFFi — (Ci)(Oi)(X+P)i
When a wood shingle roof covering on the building being considered, or on exposed buildings, can contribute to spreading fires add 500 gpm to the needed fire flow.
The needed fire flow shall not exceed 12,000 gpm nor be less than 500 gpm.
The needed fire flow shall be rounded off to the nearest 250 gpm if less than 2,500 gpm and to the nearest 500 gpm if greater than 2,500 gpm.
NOTE 1: For one-family and two-family dwellings not exceeding two stories in height, the following needed fire flows shall be used:
EXPAND
Distance Between Buildings Needed Fire Flow
Over 100'  500 gpm
31—100'  750 gpm
11—30' 1,000 gpm
10' or less 1,500 gpm
  NOTE 2: Other habitational buildings, up to 3,500 gpm maximum.
