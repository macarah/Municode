ARTICLE XIV. - B-1, NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS DISTRICT

Sec. 1401. - Purpose and intent.
The Neighborhood Business District is intended to provide areas for limited small-scale commercial uses of a convenience nature serving nearby residential neighborhoods as opposed to a regional market. The district is not intended to accommodate automotive or other types of more intensive commercial activities that are of such magnitude or type that would result in the generation of excessive traffic, noise, odors, pollution, safety hazards, or other adverse impacts which would detract from the desirability of adjacent properties for residential use. In general, the neighborhood business district includes offices and retail and service establishments but excludes those highway-oriented uses which involve use of chemicals and outside sales, storage or display.

modified
Outdoor display of goods shall be allowed as an accessory use for all uses requiring site plan approval. It is the intent of this Ordinance to allow the display of merchandise for sale, but not where the display of such items impedes the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or creates an unsafe condition.

All outdoor sales must be conducted solely and exclusively on private property.
2.
The business seeking to conduct outdoor sales must be in full compliance with all existing City of Dahlonega codes including but not limited to sign and zoning regulations.
3.
The business must absolutely meet or exceed the applicable off-street parking regulations for said business, and no portion of the required off-street parking spaces for the business may be used for the conducting of outdoor sales;
4.
All outdoor display of goods shall be located immediately adjacent to the store front and not in loading zones or fire lanes. All outdoor display areas must be contiguous to one another.
5.
No goods shall be attached to a building's wall surface and all goods offered for outdoor sale shall be goods owned by the applicant and sold in the normal course of the applicant's business;
6.
At least 5 feet along the perimeter of the display shall be maintained free of obstruction to allow for pedestrian and handicap movement, such that handicapped pedestrians and others do not have to enter the parking lot or drive aisle to "walk around" the display.
7.
The area used for outdoor display and sale of goods shall be limited to no more than Â½ of the length of the store front.

8.
The area of outdoor display and sale shall not encompass the width of the entrance doors to the facility as projected straight out from the facility.
