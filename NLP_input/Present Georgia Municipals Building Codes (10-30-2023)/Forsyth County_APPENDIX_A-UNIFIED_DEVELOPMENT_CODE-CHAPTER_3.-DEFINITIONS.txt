Significant recharge areas for Forsyth County are typified by those in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge, where rocks have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. The significant recharge areas are those with thicker soils. Field mapping indicates that thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two or more geologic contacts per four square miles (source: 1976 1:500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight percent. These aquifer recharge areas, which contain soils with properties that support the recharging of groundwater, are mapped on the Official Zoning Map of Forsyth County and/or on the Official Overlay District Map of Forsyth County. Groundwater recharge areas represent freshwater resources for some residents of the county.

Street, major arterial: Unless otherwise defined by the Forsyth County Major Transportation Plan or Comprehensive Plan, a major arterial street is a street connecting two or more towns or communities, connecting two highways of equal or greater capacity, or serving as the primary access to a large land area. A major arterial may also serve a large traffic generator (e.g., an industrial area) and perform a secondary function of providing local access.
Street, marginal access: A residential street parallel and adjacent to a major thoroughfare and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through traffic.
Street, private: A road or street that has not been accepted for maintenance by the county and that is not owned and maintained by the state, City of Cumming, another county, or another public entity.

Subdivision, minor: A subdivision of six or fewer lots which does not involve the construction of a new public or private street. Because minor subdivisions do not involve the construction of a new public or private street, they are processed administratively by the department of planning and community development as final plat applications that do not require sketch plat approval. Any improvements to an existing public street abutting the tract proposed for minor subdivision, or the installation of utilities along said existing public road, as may be required to comply with this Code, shall be done according to plans and permit requirements of this Code, but said requirements shall not subject the minor subdivision to the requirements for a major subdivision as specified in this Code.
Subdivision, major: A subdivision of seven or more lots which may or may not involve the construction of a new public or private street; or any subdivision of less than seven lots that involves the construction of a new public or private street. Because major subdivisions involve construction of a new public or private street or the upgrade of an existing private way to county standards, construction plans and land disturbance permits are required, and major subdivisions are therefore processed in multiple steps including sketch plat approval (unless specifically exempted), approval of construction plans and issuance of land disturbance permits, and final plat approval.
