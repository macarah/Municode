Footnotes:
--- (12) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2020-09 , § 1, adopted Dec. 10, 2020, repealed the former Art. XIV, §§ 104-557—104-564, and enacted a new Art. XIV as set out herein. The former Art. XIV pertained to post-development stormwater management for new development and redevelopment and derived from Code 1992, § 8-450—8-457; Ord. No. 2010-08, § 4, adopted Aug. 26, 2010.

Sec. 104-557. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Land development projects and other land-use conversions, and their associated changes to land-cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
(2)
Land development projects and other land-use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving water;
(3)
The impacts of post-construction stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of land and water;
(4)
These adverse impacts from new development and redevelopment can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures; and
(5)
Localities in the state must comply with state and federal laws, regulations and permits that require impacts of post-construction stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution be addressed.
Therefore, the county has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance regulating post-construction stormwater runoff to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-construction stormwater runoff.

i.
The environmental management department shall require documentation and calculations beyond the original submittal if, in their opinion, the plan does not satisfy the purpose as stated in this article. The approval of the plan does not preclude the necessity for field changes once construction has begun. Any such amendments to the approved plan shall be submitted to the environmental management department on revised drawings and shall be supported by such documentation as is appropriate
j.
Applicants shall consult the stormwater design manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a stormwater structural control.
(7)
Modifications for off-site facilities.

c.
Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
d.
Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or
e.
Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations.
(8)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system. In calculating runoff volumes and discharge rates, consideration may need to be given to any planned upstream land-use changes. The analysis shall be in accordance with the Stormwater Design Manual. All downstream stormwater systems (eg. road culverts) withing the analysis area shall be studied for the impacts of the development.
(9)
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
