Sec. 156.005. - Abatement authorized.
The chief building official or his designee is hereby designated as the public officer to enforce this division and is authorized to abate any nuisance existing in the county, whether or not such nuisance is specifically recognized by this division. Whenever any nuisance exists within the unincorporated area of the county or upon any property of the county, or whenever any condition shall exist on any property in the unincorporated areas of Clay County that is required or subject to be demolished, removed or abated under any of the ordinances of the county and the owner or person responsible for the nuisance refuses or fails after due notice to demolish, remove or abate the nuisance, the public officer shall issue a summons and cause it to be served upon such owner and all parties in interest (O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12), stating the condition complained of and the ordinances or parts of ordinances claimed to be violated, and requiring such person to appear before the magistrate's court at a time, date and place stated in the summons, to show cause why such condition should not be demolished, abated or removed.
(Res. of 7-5-2011)
Sec. 156.006. - Service of process.

(Res. of 7-5-2011)
Sec. 156.007. - Order for abatement.
If the magistrate at the hearing determines that a condition does exist as alleged, that constitutes a nuisance or a condition that under the ordinances of the county is required or subject to be demolished, removed or abated, the magistrate shall issue his order and judgment so finding, and shall order the property owner or other responsible person to demolish, remove or abate such condition within a period of time to be fixed by the magistrate. This order shall further provide how the condition is to be abated. This order shall further provide that if the property owner or responsible person shall fail to comply with the order within the time specified, the county, its officers and employees, shall be authorized to proceed without further notice to demolish, remove or abate such condition and to take whatever action is deemed necessary to demolish, remove or abate such condition; and the expense shall be charged against the owner of the property or responsible party in question and shall be a lien against the property upon which the condition existed, ranking equally with the lien for county taxes. Execution shall issue as in the case of county taxes, and the procedure for the enforcement of such execution shall thereafter be the same as in the case of county taxes. Where the address of the person to be served is known, or where there is a last known address, a copy of the notice shall also be mailed to such person at that address by certified mail return receipt requested.
