The order entered under subsection (e) of this section shall further provide that, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, demolish, or close the property within the specified time, the public officer may cause such property to be repaired, demolished, or closed. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence.

"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(h)
Salvage. If the public officer has a structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Neither the public officer nor the County shall have any liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(i)

(j)
Alternate remedies. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to limit or impair the authority of public officers or other County employees under existing and future ordinances to issue citations for violations of State minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, and life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and to seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section.

Sec. 10-124. - Recoupment and collection of costs; lien rights.
(a)
Lien for costs. The order issued pursuant to section 10-123(f) shall provide that the amount of all costs associated with the abatement action shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such costs shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of abatement and/or demolition, reasonable attorneys' fees and all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the Municipal Tax Collector or City Revenue Officer, restoration to grade of the real property should it be demolished, and title examination costs. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the Office of the Clerk of Superior Court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 10-121(b)(1). The Clerk of Superior Court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the County and enter the lien for costs of abatement on the general execution docket. Such lien should cross-reference the order and include the original caption and case number from the nuisance abatement action. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full.
(b)
Enforcement of lien.
(1)
Upon a final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer shall transmit to the Municipal Tax Collector or City Revenue Officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the Municipal Tax Collector or City Revenue Officer to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply. The Municipal Tax Collector or City Revenue Officer shall remit the amount collected to the general fund of the City.
(2)
Enforcement of liens may be initiated at any time following receipt by the Municipal Tax Collector or City Revenue Officer of the final determination of costs. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article.
(3)
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the County and the Tax Commissioner in the enforcement of the lien. Redemption of the property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
(c)
Waiver of lien. The City Council may waive and release any such lien imposed on property of the owner for costs incurred by the City up to the time of the entry of the order and any additional costs incurred subsequent thereto in attempting to bring the property into compliance by entering into a contract with the owner in which the owner agrees to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
