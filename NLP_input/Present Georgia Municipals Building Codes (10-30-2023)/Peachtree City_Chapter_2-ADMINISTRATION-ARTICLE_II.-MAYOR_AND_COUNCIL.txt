Sec. 2-22. - Procedure for appointing council members or mayor.
In the event that city council is authorized to appoint an individual to fill a vacancy on the council, the following procedure shall be followed:
(1)
Within five days of the occurrence of a vacancy on the city council, the mayor shall declare that a council seat is vacant and shall direct the city clerk to publish a notice in the legal organ of the city that the seat is vacant and that the city will accept applications from all citizens who are legally eligible to hold an elected council position.
(2)
Applications shall be accepted by the city clerk beginning Monday following the date the notice set forth in subsection (1) is published. Applications shall be accepted for one business week from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday unless such week contains a legal holiday in which case applications shall be accepted on the remaining business days of that week.
(3)
During the week following the acceptance of the applications on a date and time set by the mayor, the city council shall interview each of the applicants separately in a public meeting, with applicants waiting outside the meeting until their time to interview. The interviews shall consist of an oral presentation of no more than five minutes made by each candidate to the city council and no more than two questions from any single member of the city council to each applicant, with a limit of two minutes per applicant response to each question.
(4)
After all of the interviews are completed, each member of the city council shall rate the four applicants of whom he or she would like to have as a finalist for the appointment. The council members shall give a rating of "4" to his or her favorite applicant, a "3" to his or her next favorite, and so forth. If there are only three or four applicants, then the city council shall rate only two such applicants. If there are only two applicants, then the city council shall exclude this vote and proceed on to the procedure set forth in subsection (6).
(5)
The four applicants who receive the highest aggregate points shall be the four finalists. If more than one applicant ties for the fourth highest aggregate points, then all of those applicants who so tied shall also be included as a finalist. If the city council is only selecting two applicants to be finalist as provided in subsection (4), then the same procedure as set forth in this section shall be followed, but for only two finalists as opposed to four.
(6)
The finalists shall be further interviewed by the city council in a common session. After the interviews are completed, the mayor shall instruct the city council to rank each of the finalists in writing by assigning the number equal to the number of finalists for his or her favorite finalist (e.g., if there are four finalists, then the favorite would receive a ranking of "4"), a ranking of one less than the number of finalists for his or her second favorite (e.g., if there are four finalists, then the second favorite would receive a ranking of "3"), and so forth so that a numerical rating is given to each finalist. The finalist with the highest aggregate score shall be appointed as a council member for the vacant seat.
(7)
In case there is a tie for the finalist with the highest aggregate score, then the city manager and city attorney will announce that there is a tie. The mayor shall instruct the city council to rank each of the finalists that tied the highest aggregate score in writing by assigning the number equal to the number of tied finalists for his or her favorite finalist (e.g., if there are two finalists that are tied, then the favorite would receive a ranking of "2"), a ranking of one less than the number of finalists for his or her second favorite (e.g., if there are two finalists tied, then the second favorite would receive a ranking of "1"), and so forth so that a numerical rating is given to each finalist. The finalist with the highest aggregate score shall be appointed as a council member for the vacant seat. In the event of a tie for the highest aggregate score, then the procedure set forth above shall continue until two finalists remain. If the procedure is conducted again with only two finalists and a tied result, the mayor will initiate discussion between council members and a subsequent round of voting will be held. In the event of a tie, the city manager and city attorney will consult the round one scores for the tied finalists, and whichever finalist had the higher aggregate score in round one shall be appointed to the vacant seat. In the event of a tie among the same candidates in round one, the mayor shall indicate which of the two tied candidates shall be considered "heads" and the city attorney shall flip a coin to determine the appointment for the vacant position. After a candidate is identified to fill the vacant position, a motion shall be made, seconded, and voted upon to appoint the applicant to the vacant council position.
(8)
All written votes shall be counted by the city manager and city attorney.
(9)
All written votes shall contain the name of the voting council member and shall be maintained following the meeting by the city clerk. All written votes are open records.
