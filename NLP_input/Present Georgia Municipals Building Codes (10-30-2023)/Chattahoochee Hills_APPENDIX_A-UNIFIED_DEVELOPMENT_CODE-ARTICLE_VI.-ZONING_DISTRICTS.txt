ARTICLE VI. - ZONING DISTRICTS

Sec. 6-1. - Intent.
A.
The rural (RL) district is intended primarily for low density agricultural and single-family residential uses. This district is designed to stabilize and protect the rural, agricultural, and residential characteristics of the city and to encourage single-family uses on larger lots.
B.
Hamlet (HM) districts. Hamlet districts are intended primarily for the creation of communities developed at a low overall density. These districts provide a location for agricultural and residential uses to exist in close proximity to smaller scaled mixed uses, including commercial, office, manufacturing or civic uses complete with standards and parameters to encourage a pedestrian-friendly traditional development form which enhances community aesthetics and limits conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians. There are two hamlet districts:
1.
Residential hamlet (HM-R). This district is intended primarily for residential areas. This district allows agricultural or residential uses to be provided at higher densities than in the RL district and requires clustering of development and high levels of open space preservation within each individual district. No part of any residential hamlet (HM-R) district shall be within 500 feet of another residential hamlet (HM-R) district, as measured in a straight line.
2.
Mixed-use hamlet (HM-MU). This district is intended primarily for a medium-density, fine-grained mix of uses, and requires high levels of open space preservation within each individual district.
C.
Village district (VL). The village district is intended primarily for the creation of larger mixed-use communities developed at a medium to high density. This district allows agricultural and residential uses in close proximity to medium or larger scale commercial, office, manufacturing, or civic uses complete with standards and parameters to reduce dependence on automobiles, in order to encourage fine-scale mixed uses and a pedestrian-friendly traditional urban form which enhances community aesthetics and limits conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians.
D.
Historic crossroads (HC) districts. The intent of the historic crossroads (HC) districts are to:
1.
Protect the existing old Rico and Campbellton commercial areas from uses and building forms which are incompatible with the scale, character and needs of the surrounding area;
2.
Reconstitute historic crossroads communities as identified in the comprehensive plan as viable downtown districts with authentic historic character;
3.
Preserve and restore existing traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in historic crossroads communities;
4.
Promote historic small scale, local-serving commercial uses in historic crossroads communities;
5.
Provide opportunities for incremental development within a defined framework of streetscapes and building form;
6.
Prohibit or place reasonable controls on the development of inappropriate large-scale, highway-oriented retail, service, office, and dining uses which are intended to serve large areas of the city;
7.
Alleviate development pressure on the surrounding rural area by placing reasonable controls on development and expansion of strip commercial uses, especially at the fringes of this district; and
8.
Promote a nodal form of small scale historic commercial development that other zoning districts are unable to properly facilitate.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 6-2. - Development controls.
A.
Clustering.
1.
Development within each hamlet (HM) or village (VL) district shall be clustered to promote walking and relationships between building users.
2.
At least 98 percent of all lots within any individual hamlet (HM) or village (VL) district must share a side or rear lot line with, or be located immediately across a thoroughfare from, at least two other lots not used for open space and in the same development. Any lot adjacent to or across the street from a qualifying lot shall be in compliance with and count toward the total percentage. No lot shall be more than 200 feet from the nearest cluster.
3.
No more than five percent of single-family residential lots within an individual hamlet (HM) or village (VL) district may be larger than one-half acres.
B.

1.
All structures and improvements shall have facade materials and details architecturally consistent with historic pre-World War II rural, crossroads, or small-town styles common in the Piedmont or southeastern region of the United States. Approval may be contingent on proof of such consistency, as determined by approval of the zoning administrator, planning commission, and city council.
2.
Any curb cut on any public thoroughfare must be approved by the zoning administrator. Direct thoroughfare connections shall be provided for both vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent hamlet (HM) or village (VL) districts.
3.
Site design shall minimize cut-and-fill in siting of buildings, drives, and parking facilities.
4.
Buildings:
a.

Color. Paint colors shall be chosen from Sherwin Williams "Color Through the Decades" collections from 1850—1930 or the Benjamin Moore Historical Collection, or similar historical palette as approved by the zoning administrator. Unpainted surfaces shall be muted natural and earth tones. Buildings should be a single color with a complementary trim color. Bright colors or franchise colors are permitted as accents only.
c.
Windows and doors. Windows shall be vertical in proportion and topped with an appropriately proportioned lintel or arch. Windows that are openable shall be double hung.
d.
Roofs. Pitched roofs shall have pitches equal to or greater than 8:12, except that shed roofs on additions or porches may be shallower. Pitched roofs shall be traditional materials and treatments, appropriate to the historical style of the building. Where provided, parapet walls shall be of a design and materials consistent with the building facade. Facades should have a well-defined cornice with appropriate cornice returns on gabled roofs.
e.
Doorways. Front entrance doorways shall be recessed a minimum of three feet unless under an awning or a porch with a depth of eight feet or greater.
f.
Buildings shall include historically accurate architectural elements such as columns, arcades, covered entry-walkways, arches, facade offsets, windows, balconies, and recesses. Exceptions may be approved for design, color, or roof pitch when the application is accompanied with appropriate documented historical antecedents and approved by the city council.
