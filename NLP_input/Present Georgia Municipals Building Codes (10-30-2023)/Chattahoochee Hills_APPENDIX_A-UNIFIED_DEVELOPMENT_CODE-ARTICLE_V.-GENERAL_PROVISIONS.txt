Concurrency. It is the intent of this subsection that required open space is preserved as buildings and/or phases within a district are completed rather than at full build out. The following shall apply within individual hamlet (HM), village (VL), and historic crossroads (HC) districts.
1.
Residential units shall not be issued a certificate of occupancy until at least the minimum amount of required open space for those units has been permanently protected, per section 5-3 and section 6-3C. However, no open space shall be required to be permanently protected until at least ten percent of the total number of proposed units in a district have received a certificate of occupancy.
2.
Certificate(s) of occupancy shall not be issued for commercial floor area until at least the minimum amount of required open space for that floor area has been permanently protected, per section 5-3 and the percentage of the site proposed to be devoted to commercial uses, which shall consist of uses from any use category except for residential and agricultural uses. However, no open space shall be required to be permanently protected until at least ten percent of the total commercial floor area in a district has received a certificate of occupancy.
E.
Open space may be maintained and/or improved through reforestation, agriculture, sustainable forestry, pasture management, buffer replantings, stream bank protection and wetlands management or by other acceptable means as described in this UDC. The owner of the open space shall be responsible for maintenance, insurance, and taxes on the open space. The city may require a bond for maintenance.
F.
An open space management plan shall be submitted with the preliminary plat application. The open space management plan shall include the anticipated ownership and use of all protected open space parcels, along with a financial plan that demonstrates that the management expenses, taxes, and insurance will be covered by income derived from the property or other source of revenue.
(Ord. No. 21-10-228 , § 1, 10-5-2021)
Sec. 5-6. - Off-site open space.
Required open space may be transferred to an off-site parcel when meeting the following requirements. For the purpose of this section, an off-site parcel shall be a parcel outside the geographic area within which conformance with district requirements is set.
A.
The city finds that the transferred open space provides demonstrably greater value to the community than if the open space were not transferred off site. The zoning administrator will consider the following in making its determination:
1.
Whether the amount of off-site open space is sufficient to maintain the open space protection ratio required for the district in section 5-2 as calculated on the acreage of the district and the off-site open space property taken together;
2.
Whether the off-site open space protects a site currently identified as within a scenic view area;
3.
Whether the off-site open space connects elements of the city's greenspace network;
4.
Whether the off-site open space provides public Chattahoochee River access; and
5.
Whether the off-site open space protects and/or provides public access to some valued landscape, view, historic site, cultural feature, or other valued amenity unique to its site.
B.
The following transfer methods may be utilized:
1.
The purchase of property and subsequent application of a conservation easement to that property in accordance with the open space protection standards of this article;
2.
The purchase of development rights via the transferable development rights (TDR) program (see article XIII), where one TDR shall equal one acre of transferred open space requirement; or
3.
A payment in lieu of direct preservation as regulated under density transfer charges in article XIII.
C.
In no case shall the transfer of required open space result in development that does not comply with the remaining regulations of this district.
D.
The off-site parcel ("open space parcel") shall contain the amount of open space otherwise required for any permitted development on that parcel. No transferred open space may satisfy the open space requirement for more than one site.
E.
Open space requirements fulfilled on an off-site parcel shall be documented on approved zoning and development plans. Such documentation shall include the total amount of open space relocated and the location of the open space parcel.
F.
Once transferred to an open space parcel, the square footage of the transferred open space shall not be used or credited toward future open space transfers or other open space or TDR requirements.
G.
The maximum amount of the open space requirement that can be transferred off-site is as listed in the following table.

B.
Adjacent to scenic roads as designated on the city's official scenic road map, buffers shall consist of a wooded area consisting of existing or newly planted trees. Adjacent to non-scenic roads, buffers may be wooded, open, or agricultural areas. Buffers shall not include any buildings or pavement, except as specified in subsection (F).

6.
Openings within the buffer shall be allowed adjacent to non-scenic roads for up to 20 percent of the total length that a district fronts an individual thoroughfare, but not to exceed 500 feet per thoroughfare for any village (VL) district or 250 feet per thoroughfare for any hamlet (HM) district. This opening may be open rather than wooded and may include agricultural uses, but shall not include any structures or pavement. Any buildings visible from a thoroughfare within such an opening must be designed consistent with an architectural style found within 100 miles of the site between the years of 1850 and 1900.
