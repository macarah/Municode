EXPAND
Maximum Limits
Metals Conventional Pollutants
Arsenic .032 mg/l Ammonia 45 mg/L
Cadmium .008 mg/l BOD 500 mg/L
Chromium T. 3.07 mg/l Suspended Solids 500 mg/L
Chromium IV .22 mg/l PH 6.0 - 9.0 mg/L
Copper .109 mg/l
Cyanide .08 mg/l
Lead .12 mg/l
Mercury .002 mg/l
Molybdenum .021 mg/l
Nickel .150 mg/l
Phenols 14.71 mg/l
Selenium .028 mg/l
Zinc .61 mg/l
  The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances and conventional pollutants are for "total" metal and conventional pollutants unless indicated otherwise. The superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above.
(d)
State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharge shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations of those in this article.
(e)
City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(f)
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(g)
Surcharge limits. The following limits when exceeded will be assessed as follows:
EXPAND
BOD ALLOWABLE DAILY
CONCENTRATION OF
0 - 320 mg/l *normal sewer rates
320 - 400 mg/l *mg/l over 320 × 8.34

  ALKALINITY
Failure to maintain enough alkalinity to comply with requirements of Alkalinity (minimum) = ((10 + (7 × N(NH3) mg/l)) will result in the industry paying the pro rata cost incurred by the water works commission to add enough alkalinity at the qpc plant to effect the necessary treatment.
The reasoning for this assessment is to help the POTW recap out added cost of operation. These assessment charges will be billed on a separate statement monthly when occurring. The rates at which these assessments are charged are listed on a separate schedule which is on file at the City of Chatsworth Water Works office, as well as listed in each permit.
*Rates figured on daily maximum flow.

No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the superintendent of the Chatsworth Water Works Commission.
(b)
The owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnish by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgement of the superintendent. A permit and inspection fee as specified elsewhere shall be paid at the time the application is filed.
(c)
All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection or the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
(d)
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway; the front building sewer may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any single connection aforementioned.
(e)
Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the superintendent, to meet all requirements of this article.
(f)
The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in construction shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city. In the absence of code provision or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within city supervision:
(1)
The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revision, or equal; ductile iron pipe; American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe. Bolted mechanical joints may be required by the superintendent where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the superintendent.
(2)
The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the Superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eight inch per foot. Furthermore the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed.
(3)
The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines.
(4)
An excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and backfilling shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved.
(5)
All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Push-on joints for cast iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Specification C-564. Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber "O"-ring gasket having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wastes (including oils), and groundwater which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gaskets shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instruction using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the superintendent.
(6)
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly locate "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owners expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45 degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least one tenth foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent.
(g)
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor, but above the top of the manhole of the manholes upstream and downstream from the connection. Where such a connection is not possible, the city assumes no responsibility for damage to property from backups in the sewer due to blockages, flooding, collapse of the line or other unavoidable situations. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any load bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
(h)
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is approved for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage.
(i)
The applicant for the building permit shall notify the superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the superintendent or his representative.
(j)
All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
(k)
The superintendent will define the availability of sewers and any costs associated with sewer permits or construction.
(l)
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Superintendent before installation.
(m)
If any house sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow, the city may:
(1)
Require the owner to repair the house sewer.
(2)
Charge the owner a sewer rate that reflects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property.
(3)
Require the owner to disconnect his sewer from the city sewer system.

In order to provide for accurate sampling and measurement of industrial wastes, each designated discharger shall provide and maintain, on each of its industrial waste outlet sewers, a large manhole or sampling chamber with a key furnished to the city. There shall be ample room provided in each sampling chamber to enable convenient inspection and sampling by the city, or its agent. The city will require all industries to install a monitoring manhole and a separate line for industrial waste discharging. This applies to all significant industrial users.
(2)
Each sampling chamber shall contain a partial flume, accurate weir, or similar device, with a recording and totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity; or the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as the liquid quantity where it is substantiated that the metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment can be made in the metered supply to determine the liquid quantity. The measuring, totalizing, recording devices are to be supplied, installed, and maintained by the owner. The city requires any measuring device to be calibrated by a certified/trained outside party whenever the city can fairly determine that the measurement results they have been receiving are inaccurate.
(3)
Samples shall be taken every hour, properly refrigerated and composited in proportion to the flow for a representative 24-hour sample. Such sampling shall be repeated on as many days as necessary to insure representative quantities for the entire reporting period. Industrial plants with wide fluctuations in quantities of wastes, will require an automatic sampler placed automatically by the flow-measuring device. Minimum requirements for representative quantities shall include reevaluation during each quarterly period. The determination of representative quantities shall include not less than three consecutive days of 24-hour composite samplings taken during periods of normal operation, together with acceptable flow measurements. The frequency of sampling, sampling chamber, metering device, sampling methods, and analysis of samples shall subject, at any time, to inspection and verification by the city. Sampling and measuring facilities shall be such as to provide safe access for authorized personnel of the authority for making such inspection and verification. Plans for sampling chambers, with their location shown on a site plan shall be submitted to the city.

(Ord. of 10-10-96, § 7.5)
Sec. 8-52. - Reports of potential problems.
(a)
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(b)
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
(c)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the even of a discharge described in subsection (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(Ord. of 10-10-96, § 7.8)
Sec. 8-55. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 7-51. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 8-47, 8-49, and 8-50.
(b)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. of 10-10-96, § 7.9)
Sec. 8-56. - Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in questions, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. of 10-10-96, § 7.10)
Sec. 8-57. - Sample collection.
(a)
Except as indicated in subsection (b), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(Ord. of 10-10-96, § 7.11)
Sec. 8-58. - Timing.
