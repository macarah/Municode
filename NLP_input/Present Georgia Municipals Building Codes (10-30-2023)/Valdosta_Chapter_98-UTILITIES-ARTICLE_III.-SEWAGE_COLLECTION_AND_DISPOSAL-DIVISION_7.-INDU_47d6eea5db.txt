DIVISION 7. - INDUSTRIAL SEWER SURCHARGES

Sec. 98-341. - Standard pollutants.
Industrial users discharging process wastes with standard pollutants named in this section with concentrations greater than the described normal strength must obtain a wastewater contribution permit from the director of utilities. The contribution permit shall impose concentration limits and/or impose mass limitation on the daily discharge for users discharging wastes with concentrations of standard pollutants greater than these normal strengths. The director shall consider factors such as the effects on the POTW and receiving stream, the concentration and total load reaching the headworks of the treatment facility and the historical load from the user. The director shall also impose penalties for violation of concentration limits or mass limitation in additions to surcharge rates established by this article.

  The user discharging such waste shall be charged and assessed a surcharge as provided in this article, if the waste has a concentration greater than the above normal concentration.
(Code 1976, § 5-2121; Ord. No. 83-29, 9-8-1983; Ord. No. 93-42, 10-21-1993)
Sec. 98-342. - Quality determination for surcharges.
As provided in division 5 of this article, the director of utilities shall from time to time make tests to determine the character and concentration of the industrial wastes from the users. The director of utilities shall determine the average concentration of the industrial discharge from a user at least annually for calculation of the surcharge rate. If at any time the director of utilities determines that the quality of the discharge has changed, the surcharge rate may be adjusted accordingly, provided, further, that the director of utilities shall also have the authority to require pretreatment or to take other action as provided elsewhere in this article.
(Code 1976, § 5-2122; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979)
Sec. 98-343. - Quantity determination for surcharges.
A volume of flow used on computing industrial surcharges shall be determined as provided in division 5 of this article; provided, however, a reasonable approximation of flows cannot be obtained otherwise, the volume of flows shall be determined by actual measurement, utilizing a flow meter provided by the person discharging the industrial waste and approved by the director of utilities. Such meter shall be capable of recording total flows and shall also be capable of recording minimum, maximum and average flows for a period of not less than seven days.
(Code 1976, § 5-2124; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979)
Sec. 98-344. - Billing procedure.
Industrial waste surcharges provided for in this article shall be prepared and rendered with the regular water and sewer bill. The surcharge for the discharge of excessive concentrations of pollutants shall be calculated as follows:
Volume (in ccf) x 0.00624 (in pounds per ccf) x (concentration minus normal strength) x surcharge rate (in dollars per pound)
(Code 1976, § 5-2125; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979)
Sec. 98-345. - Surcharge rates.
The surcharge rates for standard pollutants shall be according to the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk, except that the director may impose incremental escalation of these rates and/or other enforcement actions for violation of mass limitations established in the users permit for discharge.
(Code 1976, § 5-2126; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979)
Secs. 98-346—98-370. - Reserved.
