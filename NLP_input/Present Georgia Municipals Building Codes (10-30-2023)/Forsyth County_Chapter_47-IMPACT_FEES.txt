(1)
The issuance or extension of a building permit, or
(2)
The issuance or extension of a permit that would allow the construction or installation of a structure, including a mobile home, or
(3)
The issuance or extension of a permit that would allow the installation or placement of a recreational vehicle.
Persons who filed a fully completed application for a permit prior to 5:00 p.m., the business day prior to the date on which the collection of road impact fees commences, which was subsequently approved within 30 days of submission, shall not be subject to the road impact fees for that permit.
(b)
Payment due.
(1)
General. Impact fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of a permit for any activity requiring payment of an impact fee. All payment shall be made in the following manner:
a.
Payment by approved credit card, personal or business check, cashier's check, or money order payable to the county;
b.
All payments are to be made at offices of the Forsyth County, Department of Planning and Community Development.
(2)
Invalid payment. In the event the payment of impact fees subsequently proves to be invalid due to insufficient funds, improper execution, or for any other reason, then the following actions shall be taken:
a.
The impact fee administrator shall, within 30 days of detection of such a deficiency, notify the feepayer, the contractor, and the property owner by certified mail to the last known address:
1.
An impact fee amount is due by valid payment immediately upon receipt of said notice;
2.
Permits, inspections or certificates will not be issued until the amount is paid and, if not paid within 30 days, the impact fee administrator shall have authority to instruct the Forsyth County Building Department to stop all construction on the site of said building or construction until the payment is received.
b.
No further building permits, construction permits, inspections or certificate of use and occupancy (C.O.) shall be issued by the county until the required impact fee is paid.
c.
The amount due shall be the amount of the impact fees plus the amount charged by the bank for the dishonored payment plus a service charge as established by the county
(3)
Credit in lieu of payment. In the event the feepayer has received approval from the impact fee administrator for credits for construction or dedication of land pursuant to section 47-24 and the credits are provided before completion of the improvements, the feepayer must comply with all requirements as a condition of receiving such credits. Otherwise, full payment of the impact fee due will be required.
(c)
Determination of fee.
(1)
General. The amount of the impact fee shall be determined by the impact fee administrator, who shall receive assistance from other departments when necessary and appropriate. The impact fee administrator shall determine the amount of the fees due, whether the method of determination is based on the fee schedule contained in the appropriate impact fee ordinance or by independent fee determination study. The calculation of exemptions, refunds, and credits, and the determination of the net impact fees due shall also be the responsibility of the impact fee administrator with the assistance of appropriate county departments.
(2)
Credits. In lieu of monetary payment, up to 100 percent of impact fees due may be paid by the use of credits, as provided in section 47-24. However, road credits may be used only for the payment of road impact fees, park credits may be used only for the payment of park impact fees, library credits may be used only for the payment of library impact fees and public safety credits may only be used for the payment of public safety impact fees.
(d)
Expiration of building permits.
(1)
If a permit expires, is revoked, or is voluntarily surrendered and is, therefore, voided and no construction or improvement of land has commenced, then the feepayer shall be entitled to a refund, without interest, of 95 percent of the impact fees which were paid as a condition for its issuance. The county shall retain five percent of the fees to offset the costs of collection and refund. The feepayer must submit an application for such a refund to the impact fee administrator within 30 days of the expiration of the permit. In the case of an expired permit which was obtained in whole or in part by the use of credits, only that portion not paid by credits may be refunded, and it is from this part that the five percent administrative fee shall be deducted.
(2)
If a refund has been received by the feepayer, the feepayer must pay the appropriate impact fee if he/she reapplies for a permit. Conversely, if a permit expires and no refund has been issued, a feepayer will not have to pay the fee again if he/she reapplies for the permit on the same lot, parcel or tract unless the use or size of the structure has changed and then the amount due would be the change in the amount of the fee based upon the new structure as contrasted with the original.
(3)
A credit for previous payment of an impact fee must be requested by the feepayer. Any exemption or credit not so requested at the time of reapplication shall be deemed waived by the feepayer.
(4)
A refund of the impact fee shall not be granted if the permit expires and construction has commenced. In this case, the feepayer will not have to pay an impact fee if he/she reapplies for a permit for the same type and size of structure. In case of reapplication, the provisions of section 47-12(g) for change of use shall apply.
(5)
The feepayer shall be responsible for requesting any credits or refunds pursuant to the terms of this chapter. The county will not be responsible for notifying the developer of a right to a refund or credit due to an expired permit. Upon receipt of such request, refunds and credits will be determined in accordance with section 47-23 and section 47-24.
(Ord. No. 125, 4-7-2016)
Sec. 47-12. - Determination of fees based on fee schedules.
(a)
Payment from schedule. At the option of the feepayer, the amount of the fees can be determined from the schedule of fees listed below, utilizing section 47-32, Impact Fee Calculation Form. Impact fees for nonresidential development shall be converted to a fee per square foot by dividing the fee per 1,000 square feet by 1,000. Any impact fee for a development application shall be rounded to the nearest dollar.
(1)
Fee schedule applicable on effective date. The following fee schedule shall apply to new development for which a building permit is issued on or after the effective date of this section.
EXPAND
Land Use Type Development Unit Impact Fee per Development Unit
Roads Parks Library Public Safety Total

Public/Institutional 1,000 sq. ft. $0 $0 $0 $227 $227
  (b)
Automatic adjustment. The impact fee schedule shown in subsection (a) above shall be adjusted by the impact fee administrator in April of each calendar year. Unless otherwise directed by the county board of commissioners, any adjustments to the impact fee made pursuant to this section shall be effective the first Monday in October of each calendar year.
(1)
The base for computing any adjustment is the January Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for the United States, published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
(2)
If the index is changed so that the base year is different, the index shall be converted in accordance with the conversion factor published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the index is discontinued or revised, such other government index or computation with which it is replaced shall be used in order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the index had not been discontinued or revised.
(3)
The current inflation-adjusted fee schedule shall be available at the building permit counter and shall be posted on the County's web site in the County's current schedule of development fees and/or separately.
(c)
Determination of land use type. If the type of development activity is not specified in the fee schedules, and is not already on a list of miscellaneous land use types maintained by the impact fee administrator, the impact fee administrator shall apply the fee of the most nearly equivalent type of land use on the fee schedules. The impact fee administrator shall be guided in the selection of a comparable land use type by the definitions in section 47-4, the list of land uses in section 47-31, the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and the land development regulations of the county. In the event that the classification of a particular use of land into the classification established by the ordinance is unclear, the North American Industry Classification System, United States, latest edition, shall be used as the final authority. The impact fee administrator shall maintain a list of the fees determined administratively for miscellaneous land use types.
(d)
Interpretation of fee schedules. Individuals may request an interpretation of the impact fee schedules as they may apply to their developments. If the individual requests, the impact fee administrator shall certify the impact fees due for that development and said certification shall establish the applicable impact fees for such development for a period of 180 days from the date thereof. If the feepayer disagrees with the interpretation of the impact fee schedules, the feepayer may prepare an individual fee determination study in accordance with this chapter and the relevant impact fee ordinance.
(e)
Mixed use development. If a development includes both residential and nonresidential uses, the impact fees are to be assessed for each use based on the fee schedule and the results added together.
(f)
Mixed use structures. If a structure includes both residential and nonresidential uses, the impact fees are to be assessed for each use individually based on the relevant fee schedule and the results added together.
(g)
Shell permit. Builders may apply for a building permit to construct the "shell" of a building. Tenant finish permits are issued later to finish construction of the interior of the structure. The impact fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of the building permit for construction of the shell. The amount of the fee shall be based on the intended land use as described by the builder. If a builder applies for a "shell" permit and the intended land use is not known, the impact fees shall be assessed based on that land use which generates the greatest impact and is allowed under the existing zoning for the lot or parcel. If it is found during review of the application for a tenant finish permit that the actual land use differs from the intended land use as described by the builder, a determination shall be made as to whether or not an additional impact fee is due based on the procedures for change of use. If so, the additional impact fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a new building permit for the completion of the shell. If it is determined that there has been an over-payment of impact fees, a refund would become available pursuant to section 47-23(e) of this chapter. If a shell permit was issued prior to the effective date of the appropriate impact fee ordinance and left unfinished, no impact fee shall be assessed for tenant finish permits. Subsequent change of use, redevelopment, or modification of the structure may be subject to an impact fee based on the procedures for change of use.
(h)
Change of use. In the case of a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fees for the new use as compared to the previous use. The amount of the impact fees that is due as a result of the change in land use shall be determined at the time the feepayer applies for a building permit. The impact fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for construction or remodeling. Previous land use shall be the lawful land use physically existing on the effective date of the ordinance or the current lawful land use. The feepayer shall furnish all documentation required by the impact fee administrator to determine the previous use. Should the change of use, redevelopment, or modification result in a net decrease in the impact, no refunds or credits for impact fees previously paid shall be made. If the change of land use does not require the issuance of a building permit, there shall be no requirement to pay an impact fee.
(i)
Accessory or auxiliary uses. Generally, no fee shall be assessed for accessory or auxiliary land uses for residential developments, such as a clubhouse or tennis court in an apartment complex, unless it can be established by the impact fee administrator that the land use serves as an individual attraction. However, structures that meet the definition of a "dwelling" in the Forsyth County Building Code are not exempted as accessory or auxiliary uses.
(j)
Mobile homes. When a person applies for a permit that would authorize the installation of a mobile home, the feepayer may request a determination by the impact fee administrator as to whether or not a mobile home (or other dwelling unit) was legally in place on that lot, parcel, or space prior to the effective date of the ordinance. If so, no impact fee shall be assessed for installation of the mobile home. An exemption will be granted if it can be documented that an impact fee has been paid previously for a mobile home on that same lot, parcel, or space. Documentation to be used by the impact fee administrator may include utility bills for the period of time in question or tax records.
(k)
House moves and mobile home moves. Impact fees shall be assessed for structures or mobile homes moved from one location to another unless the structure or unit being moved is a replacement of an equivalent use at the new location. If the structure or mobile home so moved is replaced by an equivalent use at the old location, no impact fee shall be due for the replacement use. In every case, the burden of proving past payment of impact fees, exemption, or equivalency of use rests with the feepayer.
(l)
Recreational vehicles (RV's). Reference to "recreational vehicles" refers to the recreational vehicle site which has been permitted by an applicable development approval. The development of an RV site, not the issuance of a permit, is the relevant regulatory issue for this chapter and the administration of the impact fee. Recreational vehicle development approval should contain a condition of approval providing for payment of the impact fee. The impact fee shall be paid according to this condition of approval and the following provisions:
(1)
No impact fees shall be assessed for "move in" of a recreational vehicle in an RV park developed prior to the effective date of the ordinance or that has paid an impact fee.
(2)
RV's located outside of RV parks shall be treated as mobile homes. RV owners who apply for a permit, et cetera, shall pay the impact fees at the same rate as a mobile home and are entitled to the same exemptions as mobile home owners.
(m)
Model homes. Model homes on residentially zoned land shall be charged residential impact fees. Model homes on land zoned for nonresidential use shall be charged nonresidential impact fees.

Sec. 47-14. - Individual fee determination.
(a)
Option of the feepayer. If a feepayer shall opt not to have impact fees determined according to the fee schedule in section 47-12(a), then the feepayer shall prepare and submit an individual fee determination in accordance with this section and the appropriate impact fee ordinance. The utilization of this option by the feepayer shall not exempt him/her from paying the impact fee prior to the issuance of a permit.
(b)
Notice of intent by feepayer. The feepayer shall inform the impact fee administrator of his/her intent to utilize an individual fee determination. The impact fee administrator shall then schedule a pre-application meeting with the applicant.
(c)
Pre-application meeting. Before beginning the individual fee determination study, the feepayer or his/her representative shall be given the opportunity to attend a pre-application meeting with the impact fee administrator. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to discuss the procedures of the individual fee determination study, the methodology to be employed, and the standards to be met. Results, conclusions, and agreements reached at the pre-application meeting regarding methodology, required forms or documentation, or procedures, which may not constitute a waiver of ordinance provisions, shall be placed in writing by the impact fee administrator within 15 days. A copy of this memorandum shall be sent to the applicant. The agreements set out in the letter will expire in 30 days unless the applicant acknowledges receipt and acceptance of the agreements in writing, to the impact fee administrator, within those 30 days. The applicant may waive the pre-application meeting. Any applicant who waives this pre-application meeting has waived his/her right to administratively raise methodological or procedural issues at a subsequent time.
(d)
Guidelines.
(1)
The purpose of the individual determination study is to measure the impact of the development in question on the arterial road system, the park and recreation system, the library system, or the public safety system of the county.
(2)
An individual determination study must address the expected impact of the development over the projected life of the structures within the development. Any claim that the use or occupancy of the structures within the development will be different from normal use or occupancy must be supported by deed restrictions, restrictive covenants or other appropriate documentation that will support the claim.
(3)
The individual fee determination study shall follow the methodologies and formats which are agreed upon during the pre-application meeting and be in accord with the methodology used in the supporting impact fee study. The methodology in the impact fee study multiplies the number of service units generated by the land use by the net cost per service unit. The individual fee determination study may only address the expected number of service units to be generated by the development, and shall use the net cost per service unit contained in the appropriate impact fee study. The service units are daily vehicle-miles of travel for the road impact fees, household residents for the park and library impact fees, and functional population for the public safety impact fees. In the event that the impact fees are adopted at a percentage less than 100 percent of the maximum fees calculated in the impact fee study, the individual fee determination study shall apply the same percentage at which the current fees are adopted.
a.
A minimum of three sites for the land use in question should be selected. The selected sites should be single use sites and should, whenever possible, be located in the county.
b.
The site inventory and sites proposed for the survey shall be reviewed by the impact fee administrator. The impact fee administrator must approve the sites to be surveyed prior to initiation of any survey.
(4)
The individual fee determination study shall be prepared and presented by professionals qualified in their respective fields. The methodology shall be consistent with best professional practice and support the central claim of the study. The study shall provide all necessary supporting documentation and information. Failure to adhere to best professional standards is a basis for rejection of the study. The applicant's submission must certify that the study complies with best professional practices and this attestation shall be sealed where and when applicable.
(5)
The applicant shall submit the study to the impact fee administrator. This submission shall begin the 30-day clock referred to below.
(6)
The applicant shall provide the impact fee administrator with the name, address and telephone number of the property owner, the contractor and the applicant.
(e)
Recoupment of cost.
(1)
The impact fee administrator may require applicants pursuing an individual fee determination to reimburse the county for reasonable non-staff personnel and associated expenses it incurs in order to adequately review and evaluate independent fee determinations.
(2)
The impact fee administrator shall notify applicants in writing if the county intends to obtain and seek recoupment for non-staff personnel and associated expenses that it deems necessary to properly evaluate the application.
(3)
Subsequent to notification, the impact fee administrator shall provide good faith estimates of the costs to be borne by the applicant.
(f)
Sufficiency determination.
(1)
The impact fee administrator will review the individual fee determination study for sufficiency, methodology, technical accuracy and findings. The impact fee administrator shall have 30 days to review the study and to inform the applicant, in writing, of any deficiencies or defects in the study, or to find the study complete and competent. The notice of sufficiency or lack thereof shall be mailed to the applicant. In the event that this notice is not given within 30 days, the study shall be considered complete and competent.
(2)
Upon receipt of notice of deficiencies or defects in the study, the applicant may modify or supplement the study and resubmit a modified study. The applicant shall have 30 days to respond to said notice and/or resubmit a modified study to remedy defects or deficiencies identified in the notice. The impact fee administrator will consider the individual fee determination study to be inactive if the impact fee administrator does not receive a response from the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the above notice.
(3)
Upon receipt of a response or resubmittal of the study, the impact fee administrator shall have 30 days to review the resubmittal or response and notify the applicant of any further defects or deficiencies in the resubmittal. If the impact fee administrator finds deficiencies or defects in a resubmitted study, notice of such deficiencies or defects shall be provided as in subsection (1) above and subsequent responses from applicants shall be resubmitted as provided in subsection (2) above.
(g)
Determination of fee.
(1)
The determination of the amount of the applicable impact fee shall be made by the impact fee administrator based on his/her review of a competent and sufficient independent determination study.
(2)
If an applicant requests, the impact fee administrator shall certify, as provided in the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-71-2(h), the impact fees due for a development and said certification shall establish the applicable impact fees for such development for a period of 180 days from the date thereof.
(h)
Effective date. The effective date for impact fees assessed by an individual fee determined shall be the date at which the individual fee determination study is found to be sufficient, or 30 days after submission if there is no finding with respect to sufficiency.
(i)
Notification of feepayer and appeal. Within 30 days of the determination that the study is deemed competent and complete, the impact fee administrator shall notify the feepayer in writing of the acceptance, conditional acceptance, or rejection of the request. If the feepayer disagrees with the findings of the impact fee administrator, the feepayer may appeal the decision pursuant to section 47-25.
(j)
Application for permit. It shall be the responsibility of the feepayer, at the time of application for a building permit, to present the approved individually determined fee as approved by the impact fee administrator.

(2)
Appeal to the board of commissioners.

The impact fee administrator shall transmit to the board of commissioners all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is taken. The board of commissioners shall thereafter establish a reasonable date and time for a hearing on the appeal, give due notice thereof, and make a determination on the appeal within a reasonable period of time following the hearing. Any applicant or feepayer taking an appeal shall have the right to appear at the hearing, to present their arguments through documentation and/or oral presentation, and may be represented by counsel.
