Sec. 9-5-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of the Agricultural Residential (AR) district is to maintain an area of rural use and character within Athens-Clarke County, to preserve a working agricultural landscape in these areas, to conserve environmentally sensitive resources, to stabilize and protect single-family characteristics of the districts, and to promote and encourage a suitable environment for family life. Application of the zone will ensure that the farming, pasture, and forestry uses, and the scenic values associated with these, and the single-family residential character of these areas, are protected from incompatible development that could result in the degradation of these values. Clustered housing is permitted and encouraged in the form of conservation subdivisions, leaving large amounts of land in agricultural use and open space. Recreational, institutional, and limited commercial uses are also appropriate for these districts.
