None of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions payable under the Plan shall be subject to the claim of any creditor of any Participant or to the claim of any creditor of any Beneficiary hereunder, or to any legal process of levy or attachment by any creditor of any such Participant or Beneficiary; and no such benefits shall be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any Participant or Beneficiary; and neither shall any such Participant or Beneficiary have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate, transfer, encumber, pledge, or assign any of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions under this Plan.
(b)
Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed to preclude the Administrator, subject to any terms and conditions set by the Administrator, from making a deduction and direct payment to the Adopting Employer or GMEBS on behalf of a Retired Participant for the limited purpose of paying for a contribution or premium for a post retirement benefit offered by the Adopting Employer or GMEBS, if the Retired Participant elects to have such deduction and direct payment made. An election by the Retired Participant for such deduction and direct payment may be revoked at any time.
