Employees who have been ineligible for membership in this plan, but who, because of a change in the eligibility requirements, have become eligible, shall be entitled to accumulate past service credits by electing, within 60 days after first becoming eligible, to pay into the pension fund a sum of money equal to that which would have been paid had they been eligible at the time of their employment.
Each employee who is a member of this plan who has worked for a joint city-county office or who has worked for the City of Macon, and has service for which credit has not been granted in the past due to a break in service may re-establish his or her service effective as of January 1, 1977 by paying within sixty (60) days after said date the amount of employee contributions, as determined by the retirement committee in order to establish and reinstate any broken service not previously credited.

ARTICLE IV. - REQUIREMENTS FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Every employee may retire on his or her normal retirement date (subject to the service requirement for a normal pension); however, at the employee's option, an employee may continue working after his or her normal retirement date for an extended period or periods. All employees working beyond the normal retirement date shall provide the employer a minimum of sixty (60) days' notice of intent to retire from employment.

Sec. 4.2. - Early retirement.
An employee shall become fully vested and eligible for an early pension if his or her employment is terminated on or after his or her 55th birthday provided said employee has completed five or more years of service. Payment of an early pension shall commence as of the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the date of retirement, or such later date as the employee may elect but in no event later than the first day of the month following his or her normal retirement date, and if the employee has received 60 monthly payments, the last payment shall be made as of the first day of the month in which the death of the retired employee occurs.
( Ord. No. O-15-0063, § 1, 12-15-2015 )

If the employee has received 60 monthly payments, the last payment shall be made as of the first day of the month in which the death of the retired employee occurs, or if disability ceases prior to his or her normal retirement date the last payment shall be made on the first day of the month in which disability ceases.
Disability under the plan shall be considered total and permanent if the employee is eligible for and receives disability benefits under the Social Security Act.
Where an employee is not eligible for disability benefits under the Social Security Act, he or she may be otherwise considered totally disabled under the plan if, in the opinion of the Committee, relying on the advice of a licensed physician or physicians, said employee is wholly prevented by his or her physical and/or mental condition from discharging his or her usual or comparable duties in an efficient manner. Any employee shall be considered permanently disabled, if, in the opinion of the Committee, relying on the advice of a licensed physician or physicians, said employee is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently. The Committee may require an employee, applying for retirement on the basis of total and permanent disability, under the terms of this paragraph, to undergo a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Committee, the expense thereof to be borne by the Committee. Should any such employee refuse to submit to such medical examination or examinations, he or she shall not be granted any retirement benefits during the continuance of such refusal. Once each year the Committee may require an employee receiving a disability benefit under this paragraph who has not reached his or her normal retirement date to undergo a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Committee. If it appears from such medical examination that the disability of an employee who has not reached his or her normal retirement date has ceased, his or her disability benefit shall be discontinued by the Committee. Should any such employee refuse to submit to such medical examination and should he or she fail to undergo such medical examination for a year, all his or her rights in and to his or her disability benefit shall cease. The decision of the committee on these questions shall be final and binding and may not be appealed.
If disability ceases before a retired employee attains his or her normal retirement date and the employee is reemployed by the employer, the pension payable upon his or her subsequent retirement shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.2 hereof.

( Ord. No. O-15-0063, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
Sec. 6.2. - Ten years certain option—Option 3.
The employee may elect to receive a reduced pension payable for life with 120 monthly payments guaranteed. In the event the employee should die before having received 120 monthly payments, the remaining payments will be made to his or her contingent pensioner.

Such adjusted pension payments shall be the actuarial equivalent of the pension otherwise payable to such employee. This option shall cease to be available to employees retiring on or after October 1, 2022.

The time during which payment shall be made of any of the other forms of payment provided for in this Article shall be limited to a period not exceeding the life or the life expectancy of the Employee and/or contingent pensioner.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the actuarial value of an Employee's benefit under any optional benefit is less than 50% of the value of the benefit otherwise payable to the Employee, the optional benefit shall be adjusted so that the value of the Employee's benefit under the option will be equal to an amount not less than 50% of the value of the benefit otherwise payable to the Employee.

Eligible Rollover Distribution: The term 'Eligible Rollover Distribution' means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; and any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(b)
Eligible Retirement Plan: The term 'Eligible retirement Plan' means an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or an individual retirement plan described in Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code (Roth IRA) that accepts the Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distribution. However, in the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to the surviving spouse, an Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. For these purposes, an Eligible Retirement Plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. The definition of Eligible Retirement Plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse.
(c)
Distributee: The term 'Distributee' includes an Employee or former Employee. In addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving spouse are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse. For distributions after December 31, 2009, a non-spouse beneficiary who is a "designated beneficiary" under Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, may, in accordance with Section 402(c)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code, by a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer ("direct rollover"), roll over all or any portion of his or her distribution to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) the beneficiary establishes for purposes of receiving the distribution. In order to be able to roll over the distribution, the distribution otherwise must satisfy the definition of an "eligible rollover distribution" under Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. Although a non-spouse beneficiary may roll over directly a distribution, the distribution is not subject to the direct rollover requirements of Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice requirements of Section 402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code or the mandatory withholding requirements of Section 3405(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a non-spouse beneficiary receives a distribution from the Plan, the distribution is not eligible for a 60-day (non-direct) rollover. If the Participant's named beneficiary is a trust, the Plan may make a direct rollover to an IRA on behalf of the trust, provided the trust satisfies the requirements to be a "designated beneficiary" within the meaning of Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(d)
Direct Rollover: The term 'Direct Rollover' means a payment by the Plan to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee.

( Ord. No. O-15-0063, § 1, 12-15-2015 )
Sec. 7.2. - Death benefit.
If the death of an employee who has a surviving spouse occurs before actual retirement, and such employee has at least five (5) years of service, a benefit equal to fifty (50) percent of the employee's benefit, shall be computed in accordance with section 5.14} considering average monthly compensation and service at the employee's date of death, shall be payable to such spouse. For purposes of this section 7.2, surviving spouse or spouse shall be the person to whom the employee was married on the date of his or her death. The spouse's benefit shall commence on the first day of the month following the employee's death, with payment continuing for the lifetime of the spouse. If the spouse dies before receiving benefits equal to the amount of the employee's contribution to the plan, the difference between the employee's own contributions and the actual benefits paid will be refunded to the spouse's estate.
Prior to October 1, 2022, if there is no surviving spouse and the death of an employee occurs before age fifty-five (55), no benefit is payable under the plan with the exception of the return of the employee's contributions, if any.
Effective October 1, 2022, if there is no surviving spouse and the death of an employee with five (5) or more years of service occurs before actual retirement, regardless of the age of the employee at the time of death, a pension shall be payable to the employee's beneficiary, designated pursuant to section 7.3, for sixty (60) months. The amount of such pension shall be equal to the pension which the employee would have received if his or her retirement had taken place immediately prior to his or her death. After the sixty (60) monthly payments have been made to the beneficiary, the beneficiary will receive an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the employee's own contributions over the actual benefits paid.

Sec. 7.3. - Post-retirement death benefit.
If an optional benefit under Article VI is in effect at the time of the employee's retirement or death, any death benefit payable will be in accordance with the option elected.
If a retired employee is receiving a pension under Article V and no option was elected and if his or her death occurs before he or she has received payments for 60 months, the employee's beneficiary shall be entitled to a monthly pension for the remainder of the 60 month period, that is, until such time as 60 monthly payments have been made to the employee and his or her beneficiary. The monthly amount payable to the beneficiary shall be equal to the monthly amount of pension which the employee was receiving prior to his or her death.
Every employee shall designate the beneficiary who shall receive the benefit, if any, which is payable upon his or her death under this Section 7.3. An employee may change or revoke his or her designation of beneficiary at any time and from time to time. The designation of a beneficiary, and any change or revocation thereof, shall be made in writing on forms approved by the committee. An employee may also designate a contingent beneficiary to receive benefits under this section in the event the primary beneficiary's death occurs before all payments under this Section 7.3 have been made. If an employee fails to designate a beneficiary, or if no designated beneficiary survives the employee, or if all designated beneficiaries die before all payments required by this Section 7.3 have been made, the remaining payments shall be paid in accordance with the following order of precedence:
(a)
to the employee's surviving spouse; or, if there be none surviving,
(b)
to the employee's surviving children (in equal shares); or, if there be none surviving,
(c)
to the employee's surviving parents (in equal shares); or, if there be none surviving,
(d)
to the employee's estate.

Sec. 7.4. - Cost of living adjustment.
Beginning sixty (60) days immediately following the effective date of this ordinance and each January 1 thereafter, all retired employees and beneficiaries thereof eligible to receive a monthly retirement payment shall receive an annual cost of living adjustment increase of 1.5% of their monthly retirement benefit, except that no such increase shall be effective as to any year for which such increase is disapproved by the governing body of the City of Macon, based on the financial soundness of the plan. The monthly retirement payment shall be adjusted by multiplying the amount of the monthly payment by 1.5%. For purposes of clarity, this cost of living adjustment shall apply to benefits paid to Employees who retire in one calendar year, but who do not receive their first monthly benefit payment until on or after January 1st of the following calendar year, such that the very first monthly benefit payment made to such Employee will be increased by the amount of the cost of living adjustment.
( Ord. No. O-15-0063, § 1, 12-15-2015 ; Ord. No. O-22-0049 , § 1, 8-16-2022)
Sec. 7.5. - Refund of employee contributions.
In no event will the total amount paid to or on account of an employee under Articles V and VII of the plan be less than the amount he or she has contributed to the pension fund, if any.
Upon the termination of an employee who is not eligible for any benefit under the plan, such employee shall receive a refund of his or her employee contributions, if any said contributions were made by employee. Any employee entitled to a deferred termination benefit, as defined under Section 7.1, shall not ordinarily receive a refund of employee contributions, if any such contributions have been made. However, should any employee entitled to a deferred termination benefit request a refund of his or her employee contributions, if any, then said employee shall sign a Waiver of Deferred Termination Benefit before such refund is granted and shall have no other remaining rights or interest in the plan.

ARTICLE XI. - EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE

Sec. 11.1 - Early Retirement Incentive Program
An enhanced early retirement benefit shall be made available to certain employees participating in this Plan on a one-time basis, in accordance with and subject to the following requirements, and shall be referred to herein as the Early Retirement Incentive Program or "ERIP".
An employee participating in this Plan is eligible to elect to participate in the ERIP and receive a normal pension, if, assuming the employee worked through December 31, 2015, he or she attained age fifty-eight (58) and earned at least three (3) years of service on or before December 31, 2015. An employee is eligible to elect to participate in the ERIP and receive an early pension if, assuming the Participant worked through December 31, 2015, he or she attained age fifty-three (53) and earned at least three (3) years of service. Terminated employees and elected employees are not eligible to elect to participate in the ERIP.
Subject to the applicable limitations of Code Section 415, the enhanced early retirement incentive benefit payable to an employee who elects to participate in the ERIP shall be computed by substituting a multiplier of two percent (2.0%) for benefits determined under Section 5.1 and 5.2, and assuming the employee worked for the employer until December 31, 2015. Therefore, the pension benefit shall be based upon the employee's service and his average compensation as of December 31, 2015, times 2.0%; provided, however the early pension shall be subject to the reductions as provided in Section 5.2 of the Plan.
A supplemental benefit will be paid from the Plan to an employee who elects to participate in the ERIP equal to $200 per month for the life of the employee.
Any employee, who satisfies the eligibility requirements of the ERIP in Section (a) above, may elect to terminate employment, retire and receive the enhanced early retirement benefit described in this Section by submitting the required forms to the designated individual no later than 5:00 p.m. on July 31, 2015. An employee may not make an election to retire under the ERIP after he or she has terminated employment with the Employer.
Any employee electing to retire early under the ERIP may revoke his or her election by providing written notice of the revocation to the designated individual within seven (7) days after he or she submitted the election form (the revocation period). If the employee does not revoke his or her election within the 7-day revocation period, the election to terminate employment, retire and receive an enhanced retirement benefit pursuant to the ERIP shall become irrevocable when the revocation period ends.
Employees who irrevocably elect to participate in the ERIP shall be required to retire no later than September 30, 2015. Benefits for an employee who elects to participate in the ERIP shall commence on the first day of the month following his or her termination of employment and shall be paid on the first day of each succeeding month thereafter for as long as the employee remains eligible to receive such benefits. If the employee dies before commencement of benefits under this ERIP, the employee's election to participate in the ERIP shall be null and void, notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary.
The election to retire and receive enhanced early retirement benefits pursuant to the ERIP shall be completely voluntary.
The rights and obligations under the Plan with respect to employees whose employment with the Employer is terminated for any reason whatsoever prior to the effective date of this Plan Amendment shall be governed by the Plan as it existed and was in effect at the time of such termination.
Notwithstanding any prior provisions or agreements to the contrary, effective October 1, 2022, any disqualifications from reapplying for employment with the Employer or from becoming reemployed with the Employer, which were placed on any former employee who elected to retire under the ERIP provided for in this Article shall be released, and henceforth, the participation of any former employee in the ERIP program under this Article shall no longer be a bar to reemployment with the Employer, provided that any such application for reemployment will be evaluated on the applicant's qualifications, and that no special favor or consideration will be granted to any applicant on the basis of participating in the ERIP program either.
