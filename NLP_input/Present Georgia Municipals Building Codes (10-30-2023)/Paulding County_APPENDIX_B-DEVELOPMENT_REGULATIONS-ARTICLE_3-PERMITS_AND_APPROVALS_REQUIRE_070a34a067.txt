ARTICLE 3 - PERMITS AND APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPMENT OR CONSTRUCTION

3.1 - Developments of regional impact.
The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 authorized the department of community affairs (DCA) to establish procedures for regional review of development projects that are of sufficient size that they are likely to create impacts beyond the jurisdiction in which the project will be located. These large-scale projects are referred to as developments of regional impact (DRIs). Projects that exceed the minimum thresholds established by the DCA are required to go the DRI process prior to commencement of development activity. This process involves submittal to the Coosa Valley Regional Development Center (RDC) and review and comments from other local governments and affected parties. Within 30 days, the RDC will issue the results of the review process including a review finding that the proposed activity is or is not in the best interest of the state.

3.2.1 Land disturbance permits. No disturbance of the land, including clearing, grubbing or grading activities, shall commence or proceed except in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, unless the activity is exempt as an agricultural activity, or is for the construction of an approved private dwelling on a buildable lot of record.

For the purposes of these regulations, a lapse in or suspension of development activity as authorized by a development permit, as a direct result of action or inaction on the part of Paulding County completely beyond the control of the developer, shall not be considered as a lapse in activity causing the development permit to expire. The 12 months within which development activity must begin shall exclude any such time period during which the activity is prohibited or has been caused to lapse by said county action or inaction.
