Sec. 10-324. - Legislative findings.
In enacting this article, the mayor and city council of the city make the following legislative findings:
(a)
The orderly flow of motorized traffic is a major concern in congested urban areas, particularly because an obstruction or delay in traffic at one point along a traffic artery results in delays and backups far down the roadway.
(b)
There exists a substantial disruption in crowd and traffic control caused by the solicitation of contributions.
(c)
Solicitation and selling requires "stopping [individuals] momentarily or for longer periods of time as money is given or exchanged for literature." Heffron v. International Society of Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 653 (1981).
(d)
Restrictions on the solicitation of contributions or sale of items on public streets and highways is necessary to assure the free movement of vehicle traffic on those streets and highways.
(e)
Unlike oral advocacy of ideas or the distribution of literature, successful solicitation of contributions or sales requires the individual to respond by searching for currency and passing it to the solicitor.
(f)
After the solicitor has departed, the driver must then secure any change returned, replace a wallet, or close a purse, and then return proper attention to his or her full responsibilities as motor vehicle driver.
(g)
The direct personal solicitation from drivers and occupants of motor vehicles distracts the driver from his or her primary duty to watch the traffic and potential hazards in the road, observe all traffic control signals or warnings, and prepare to move through the intersection.
(h)
The distraction of motorists occasioned by solicitation not only threatens to impede the orderly flow of traffic, but also raises concerns of traffic and public safety.
(i)
Evident dangers of physical injury and traffic disruption are present when individuals stand in the center of busy streets trying to engage drivers and solicit contributions from them. United States Labor Party v. Oremus, 619 F.2d 683, 688 (7th Cir. 1980).
