Sec. 302. - Districts explained.
A.
Districts are areas of land within Spalding County to which different development requirements and standards are applied. These differences are intended to promote the separation of incompatible uses, encourage sound land use patterns, and retain the character of the community. Although this ordinance establishes the locations of districts as indicated on the official map, a district may be changed in the future in order to meet changing needs.
B.
In making the decision to change a district, the points contained in section 414 must be considered by the planning commission as well as the board of commissioners.
