State Law reference— Governing authority has power to enact legislation to restrict operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3; establishment, maintenance or use of building, structure or place for unlawful sexual purposes, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1.

Sec. 10-19. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Purpose; intent. The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments as defined herein, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character and preservation of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful.
(b)
Findings. Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Georgia, Fulton County, Georgia, DeKalb County, Georgia, Richmond County, Georgia, Floyd County, Georgia, Amarillo, Texas, Austin, Texas, Garden Grove, California, Houston, Texas, Renton, Washington, Phoenix, Arizona, Augusta, Georgia, LaGrange, Georgia, Dalton, Georgia, Whitfield County, Georgia, Carrollton, Georgia, Smyrna, Georgia, Rome, Georgia, Bartow County, Georgia, and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences are believed to be relevant to the problems faced by Wilkes County, Georgia, the Wilkes County Board of Commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed in the unincorporated limits of the county and prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in said establishment is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.
