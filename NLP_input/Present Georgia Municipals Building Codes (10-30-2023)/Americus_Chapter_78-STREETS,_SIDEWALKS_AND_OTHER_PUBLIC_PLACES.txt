ARTICLE VI. - NAMING OF STREETS
DIVISION 1. - NAMING OF NEW STREETS

Sec. 78-150. - Title.
This division shall be known as the "naming of new streets" division and may be referred to by that title.
(Ord. No. O-07-03-12, § 18-100, 3-22-2007)
Sec. 78-151. - Authority.
The governing body of the city shall have the sole power and authority to name new streets located within the incorporated limits of the city where such streets are owned by the City of Americus.
(Ord. No. O-07-03-12, § 18-101, 3-22-2007)
Sec. 78-152. - Procedures.
With respect to the naming of a new street owned by the city and located within the corporate limits of the City of Americus, the governing body shall be required to follow the following procedures with respect to the naming of such new street:
(1)
By application of a citizen or group of citizens.
a.
A citizen or group of city citizens may submit an application to name a new street hereunder. Such application shall be on forms prescribed by the city clerk. Such application shall not be considered unless at least 75 percent of the persons owning real property abutting such new street submit a written application to the city clerk requesting that such street be named a particular name.
b.
Such application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $100.00, which is intended to cover administrative and other costs which are anticipated to be incurred by the city in connection with its consideration of the application. Such application fee shall be deposited into the general fund of the city.
c.
The governing body of the city shall consider such application and act thereon in accord with this division no later than 90 calendar days after the date of submission of such application to the city clerk. In the event that the governing body does not act upon the application prior to the expiration of such 90 calendar day period, then the street shall be automatically renamed as requested in the application.
d.
Upon receipt of the application by the city clerk, the city clerk shall proceed to validate the application. The city clerk shall validate the application by verifying that the proper number of signatures is contained on the application and that the persons signing the application are owners of real property abutting said street as required by this division. In the event that the city clerk determines that the application is invalid for any reason, or that the application does not contain sufficient signatures, the application shall be returned to the person or persons submitting such application, and it shall not be subject to further consideration by the governing body until such time as a new application is submitted and the city clerk validates the new application.
e.
In determining the required percentage of the persons signing such application in connection with the validation thereof, where property abutting such street is owned by more than one person, the signature of only one such owner shall be counted in calculating such 75 percent. In addition, persons who rent or lease real property abutting such street may sign such application, but their signatures shall not be counted toward the 75 percent threshold for submission of the application to the governing body. Signatures on any such application signed more than 90 calendar days prior to the date of submission of the application to the city clerk shall be invalid and shall not be counted toward the 75 percent threshold. In the event that more than one application for naming a new street is presented to the city clerk, the city clerk shall validate such applications in the order received. The first application validated by the city clerk shall be presented to the governing body first, and only if the resolution to approve the application is denied shall the city clerk present the second or subsequent validated application to the governing body.
f.
The application shall be in such form as established by the city clerk. At a minimum, the application shall indicate thereon the location of the street, the proposed name of the street, the printed name, street address, and signature of each property owner signing such application, and the date that each property owner signed the application. In addition, each such application shall include therewith a written statement which provides, in succinct detail, the reasons for the proposed street naming in honor of a particular person or business listed in the application. In providing such written statement, the criteria to be considered by the governing body regarding the naming of such street as more particularly established in this division shall be specifically addressed by the application in such written statement accompanying the street naming application. In addition, the application shall also list any public announcement or public recognition request that should accompany any official street naming ceremony undertaken by the city in connection with the naming of such street.
g.
In the event that the city clerk determines that the application is valid, then prior to the submission of the application to the governing body, the city clerk shall undertake the following:
1.
Provide notification of the application to and compile for review by the governing body responses to the application from the following:
i.
All city agencies and departments, including, but not limited to; city police, city fire and EMS, city GIS system personnel, city building risk management risk department, and other city agencies or departments that the clerk deems appropriate;
ii.
All other local, state, or national agencies which the city clerk determines may be affected by the naming of the street;
iii.
All schools located in the immediate vicinity of the street;
iv.
Any other persons or entities the city clerk deems, in his or her sole discretion, should receive notice of the proposed street naming.
2.
Review existing public records for the purpose of establishing that the proposed street name does not duplicate any existing street name and is not confusingly similar to any existing street name in Americus or Sumter County.
h.
Upon the completion of the foregoing, the city clerk shall be required to place consideration of the application on the agenda for the city council meeting occurring in the calendar month after the month in which the application was finally validated. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the tabling of such proposal by the governing body, but in no event shall consideration of such proposal by the city council be delayed beyond 90 calendar days after the validated application was filed with the city clerk.
i.
Prior to the governing body considering or voting upon such application, the governing body shall hold a public hearing regarding such application. Notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the city's legal organ no later than the day prior to the date of the public hearing. Such public notice shall advise the public regarding the application, the proposed new street name, and the time and place of the scheduled public hearing before the governing body. Such public hearing shall be conducted with the same formality as that required of public hearings in connection with zoning and rezoning matters before the governing body. Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the governing body shall be authorized to vote on the application.
j.
In the event that the application is approved by an appropriate resolution of the governing body, the name of the street shall take effect at such time as is determined by the governing body in such resolution.
k.
Upon adoption of the resolution by the governing body, the city clerk shall undertake the following:

Provide written notice to each property owner owning property abutting the street of the official name of the street as approved by the governing body;
2.
Provide written notice of the name of the street to the United States Postal Service;

The procedures to be followed by the governing body in the event that such an application is submitted shall be the same procedures as previously outlined in this section, except that no application fee shall be required, and the application shall not require the signatures of 75 percent of the persons owning real property abutting the new street.

With respect to a living person, such person must have reached the age of 75 years at the time of the submission of the application, unless such age limitation is affirmatively waived by the governing body of the city within 30 calendar days after the filing of the application required by section 78-152.

In the event that consideration is given to naming a new street after a business, an organization, or a nonprofit entity, the governing body of the city shall consider the following:
(1)
Whether such entity is located upon such street;
(2)
The length of time that such entity has been located on such street;

The length of time that such entity has been located within the city;
(4)
The civic, community, and educational contributions of the business to the city and its citizens; or

(Ord. No. O-07-03-11, § 18-202, 3-22-2007)

(a)
Whenever any lot owner or owners located within the corporate limits of the city desire to request the city to install a sidewalk fronting the property owned by such lot owner or owners along one or more sides of a city block, then such lot owner or owners shall notify the city clerk, who shall provide the lot owner or owners with a pre-printed petition, which petition shall be for the purpose of ascertaining the level of support for the installation of such sidewalk. At the time of providing the petition to the lot owner or owners, the city clerk shall determine an estimated installation cost of the proposed sidewalk, which cost shall be assessed to each lot owner in a prorated amount as established in this article, and such estimated cost shall be provided to the lot owner or owners requesting the application.
(b)
Such petition shall have typed thereon a title, which shall be "Petition Requesting the City of Americus to Install a Sidewalk Along the ___________ Side of ___________ Street from ___________ Street to ___________ Street." There shall further be typed thereon the following statement at the top of each page of the petition:
The undersigned, by signing this petition, do hereby request the City of Americus to install a sidewalk as described above. The undersigned have been informed and do understand that if at least 75 percent of the record owners of lots abutting such proposed sidewalk sign this petition, the governing body of the city may authorize the installation of such sidewalk, and each record owner of a lot or lots abutting said sidewalk shall be required to pay the pro-rated cost of installation of such sidewalk as established by city ordinance.
(c)
Such petition shall thereafter have spaces for the printed name and address, the legal signature, and the date of signing for each lot owner who signs such petition. Such petition shall be returned to the city clerk within 90 calendar days of the date that the petition was delivered by the city clerk to the lot owner or owners requesting such petition. No such petition shall be returned to or accepted by the city clerk until at least 75 percent of the record lot owners abutting the proposed sidewalk shall have signed the petition. For purposes of ascertaining the 75 percent threshold, the following shall apply:
(1)
A lot owner may be counted as signing the petition only once, regardless of the number of lots such lot owner may own abutting said sidewalk.
(2)
Where property is owned by more than one person, the signature of only one such owner shall be counted in calculating such 75 percent.
(3)
Persons who rent or lease property abutting such proposed sidewalk may sign such petition, but their signatures shall not be counted toward the 75 percent threshold.
(4)
Where the lot owner is a corporation or other legal entity, the petition shall only be signed by an authorized officer or agent of the corporation.
(d)
Upon submission of said petition as a single petition to the city clerk, the city clerk shall cause the signatures thereon to be verified. The city clerk shall validate the petition by verifying that the proper number of signatures is contained on the petition and that the persons signing the petition are owners of real property abutting said proposed sidewalk as required by this article. In the event that the city clerk determines that the petition is invalid for any reason, or if the application does not contain sufficient signatures, the application shall be returned to the person or persons submitting such application, and it shall not be subject to further consideration by the governing body until such time as a new application is submitted and the city clerk validates the new application. Any persons who are not record
owners of lots abutting the proposed sidewalk, or who are otherwise not authorized to sign such petition or have their signatures counted, shall have their names stricken from the petition and shall not be counted for purposes of ascertaining the 75 percent threshold.
(e)
If, after verification of the signatures, the city clerk determines that at least 75 percent of the lot owners owning real property abutting the proposed sidewalk have signed the petition, then said petition shall be presented to the governing body of the city at its next regular monthly meeting for consideration. In the event that the petition contains the properly verified signatures of at least 75 percent of the persons owning real property abutting the proposed sidewalk, the city council shall be authorized to approve the installation of the sidewalk, but the city council shall not be required to approve such installation.
(f)
If the installation of such sidewalk is approved by the city council, the appropriate city departments shall proceed with the installation of such sidewalk, which installation shall be performed in accord with applicable building and other codes.
(g)
The city shall provide all labor and materials required for the installation of the sidewalk. At the conclusion of the installation, the city clerk shall determine the actual total installation cost incurred by the city, including, but not limited to; the cost of labor, materials, right-of-way acquisition, surveys, and engineering costs. Such cost shall be determined within 30 calendar days of the completion of the installation. The finance director shall then determine the cost of the installation per linear foot and shall cause each lot owner abutting such subdivision to be billed an amount equal to such cost per linear foot times the number of linear feet owned by such lot owner abutting the installed sidewalk. Such bills shall be paid by the lot owners within 30 days of submission by the city. In the event that it is requested by one or more lot owners and approved by the governing body, and in lieu of payment of such cost of installation in one payment, as to any lot owner or owners so requesting, the city shall be authorized to bill each lot owner for such lot owner's prorated cost over a 12-month period; provided, however, that any lot owner requesting to be billed over a 12-month period shall also pay interest equal to one percent per month on the unpaid principal balance until all payments are paid in full. The sale of the lot prior to the lot owner's payment of such prorated cost shall not relieve the lot owner of the obligation to pay such cost in full as required by this article. Failure to pay any installment when due shall entitle the city to terminate utility services to the lot owner in the same manner as if the lot owner had failed to pay a city utility bill. Nothing herein shall prohibit the city from including the billing for the pro-rata share of the installation of such sidewalk to the lot owners in the lot owner's monthly utility bill.

The city shall not be required to install such sidewalk unless the city obtains from each lot owner a deed to such real property as the city may require in order for the city to construct said sidewalk. Such right-of-way shall be conveyed to the city in fee simple and at no cost or expense to the city.
(b)
No application for the construction of a sidewalk shall be accepted by the city clerk hereunder, unless such application includes the construction and paving of a sidewalk for the distance of at least one side of a city block.
(c)
No application shall be accepted by the city clerk hereunder for the repaving of an existing paved sidewalk.
(Ord. No. O-07-03-11, § 18-204, 3-22-2007)

(Ord. No. O-07-03-11, § 18-205, 3-22-2007)
Sec. 78-206. - Prohibition.
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit the city from undertaking to construct sidewalks at such locations as the city may deem appropriate and in the best interest of the city and its citizens, regardless of whether a petition as described in section 78-203 hereof, has been submitted to the city. Any such construction by the city shall be undertaken and completed at the sole cost and expense of the city.
