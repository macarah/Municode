ARTICLE V. - STANDARDS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAE AND TOWERS

Sec. 18-150. - Purposes.
(a)
This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this article shall:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city;
(2)
Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae;
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunications tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
(7)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

Sec. 18-151. - Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves for telephonic radio, television, or personal wireless services. For the purposes of this article, the term "antenna" does not include any tower and antenna under 70 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, any device designed for over-the-air reception of radio or television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution service or direct broadcast satellite service, or any cable television head end or hub towers and antennae used solely for cable television services.
Director means the Planning and Development Director of the City of Chamblee or his/her designee.
Governing body means the City Council for the City of Chamblee.
Macro-telecommunications facilities are those which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing support structures and which project more than three feet above the top of the structure but no more than ten feet above the roof line, parapet or top of the structure. Macro-telecommunication facilities may exceed the height limitation specified for the zoning district.
Micro-telecommunications facilities are those which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing support structures where antennae do not project more than three feet above the top of the structure and there are no more than six antennae per site.
Monopole tower means a telecommunications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors.
Telecommunications facilities refers to antennae and towers, either individually or together.
Tower means a structure, such as a lattice tower, guy tower, or monopole tower, constructed as a freestanding structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, on which is located one or more antennae intended for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication. The term includes microwave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers.

(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Sec. 18-153. - Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district.
(a)
In districts zoned for primarily light industrial use (I and IT), micro- and macro-telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 80 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of building permit. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least three users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 120 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the director.
(b)
In districts zoned for primarily multifamily residential use or mixed-use (NR-3, VR, NC-1, NC-2, CC, CVC, VC, TOD, and MU-BC), micro- and macro-telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right following design review by and receipt of a building permit. Monopole towers up to a height of 50 feet are permitted as a use of right following design review by and receipt of a building permit.
(c)
In districts zoned for primarily single-family residential use (NR-1 and NR-2), micro-telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use as of right on nonresidential structures following design review by and receipt of a building permit.
(d)
Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built after approval of a variance in accordance with the zoning provisions of the city (see subsection 18-156(c)), as well as receipt of a building permit.
(e)
No application for a telecommunications facility with a tower height above the minimum heights as set forth above will be accepted unless the applicant has a valid, binding contract with a co-locator for a term no less than the term of the lease between the applicant and the property owner or tenant of the property on which the telecommunications facility is to be located.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Sec. 18-154. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
(a)
Preferred locations sites.
(1)
Co-location sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the director or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive.
(2)
Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches.
(3)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Mixed-use buildings in high density districts. Mixed-use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
(b)
Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or two-family dwelling (duplex) structure or site, shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facility.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Sec. 18-155. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
(a)
General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article.
(1)
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director.
(2)
Regulatory compliance.
a.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standard or regulations.
b.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
(3)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(5)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this article are met.
(6)
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(7)
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The director may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the director.
(8)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(9)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
(10)
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided however, that the director may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to 1½ times the height of the tower from any property line. (Example: 80-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires 120-foot setback from any property line).
2.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
3.
Telecommunications facilities must be set back from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 18-156.
b.
For antennae attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1.5 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires 15-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
(b)
Additional requirements for towers.
(1)
Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
(2)
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
(3)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and build environment.
(4)
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable.
(5)
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district.
(6)
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
(7)
Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
(8)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the tower on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(9)
No tower may be located within 800 feet of the centerline of any approach or departure flight path of aircraft, including helicopters, operating from any airport or helipad located partially or wholly within the city limits.
