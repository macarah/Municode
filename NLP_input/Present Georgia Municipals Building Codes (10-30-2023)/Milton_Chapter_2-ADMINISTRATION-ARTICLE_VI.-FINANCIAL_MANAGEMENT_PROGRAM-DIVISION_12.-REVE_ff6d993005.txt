DIVISION 12. - REVENUE ADMINISTRATION POLICY

Sec. 2-670. - Scope.
The city levies, collects and records certain taxes, license and permit fees, intergovernmental revenues, charges for service, investment income, fines and forfeitures, and other miscellaneous revenues and financing sources. This division provides direction in the application, acceptance and administration of revenues the city receives.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-671. - Diversification and stability.
(a)
All revenues have particular characteristics in terms of stability, growth, sensitivity to inflation or business cycle effects, and impact on the tax and ratepayers. A diversity of revenue sources can improve a city's ability to handle fluctuations in revenues and potentially help to better distribute the cost of providing services.
(b)
The city shall strive to maintain a diversified and stable revenue structure to shelter it from short-term fluctuations in any primary revenue source. When possible, the revenue mix shall combine elastic and inelastic revenue sources to minimize the effect of economic downturns.
(c)
The city will work towards diversifying its revenue base in order to reduce its dependence upon property taxes.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-672. - Conservative revenue estimates.
As part of the annual budget process, an objective analytical process, will estimate revenues realistically and prudently. The city will estimate revenues of a volatile nature conservatively.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-673. - User-based fees and charges (exchange revenue).
(a)
The level of user fee cost recovery should consider the communitywide versus special service nature of the program or activity. The use of general purpose revenues is appropriate for communitywide services, while user fees are appropriate for services that are of special benefit to easily identified individuals or groups.
(b)
The city will strive to keep a simple revenue system that will result in a decrease of compliance costs for the taxpayer or service recipient and a corresponding decrease in avoidance to pay.
(c)
The city's revenue system will strive to maintain equity in its structure. This means the city will seek to minimize or eliminate all forms for subsidization between entities, funds, services, utilities, and customers. However, it is recognized that public policy decisions may lead to subsidies in certain circumstances (e.g., senior citizen partial tax abatement).
(d)
Fees will be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis to ensure that they keep pace with changes in the cost-of-living as well as changes in methods or levels of service delivery.
(e)
For services associated with a user fee or charge, a fee shall offset the costs of that service, where possible. The costs of services include direct and indirect costs such as:
(1)
Operating and maintenance costs;
(2)
Administrative costs; and
(3)
Charges for the use of capital (e.g., depreciation and/or debt service).
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-674. - Alternative revenue sources.
The city shall seek alternative funding sources whenever possible to reduce the required revenue from nonexchange transactions (e.g., property taxes). Such alternative sources include:
(1)
Private and public grants;
(2)
Federal or state assistance; and
(3)
Public and private contributions.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-675. - Revenue collection.
The city will follow an aggressive policy of collecting revenues consistent with state and federal laws. This policy includes the following:

Charging of penalties and interest;
(2)
Revoking city licenses; and
(3)
Providing for the transfer and assignment of tax executions.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-676. - Rates and charges.
The city council shall approve all revenue rates, charges, and processes in association with receipted funds that are deposited by the city in conjunction with the annual financial plan (i.e., fiscal year budget) and revenue handbook (see section 2-677).
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-677. - Revenue handbook.
A revenue handbook will be established and updated annually as part of the budget process. This handbook will be utilized to adjust all fees, user charges, and applicable taxes or other revenue sources. The handbook will include at least the following information:
(1)
The revenue source.
(2)
Legal authorization.
(3)
Method of collection.
(4)
Department responsible for collection.
(5)
Rate or charge history.
