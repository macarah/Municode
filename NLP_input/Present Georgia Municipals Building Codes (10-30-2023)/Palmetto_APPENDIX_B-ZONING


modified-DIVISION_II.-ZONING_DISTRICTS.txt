Sec. 9-1. - Purpose.
new
A.
"M-1," Light Industrial District. The M-1 District is established for light industries such as light manufacturing or processing of previously refined materials and other industrial uses that have little or no adverse impact upon neighboring districts. This district also allows certain commercial uses of an industrial character or that are necessary to provide services to employees within the district. Limitations regarding the degree of noise, smoke, glare, odor and vibration are placed upon M-1 uses to preclude or minimize adverse effects upon nearby commercial or residential districts. It is intended that this district act as a transition between heavier manufacturing and non-industrial areas. Its purpose is to provide jobs for citizens of the community and surrounding area, establish a sustainable tax base and create value for property owners and the community.
B.
"M-2," Heavy Industrial District. The M-2 District is established to accommodate intense industrial uses that are primarily of a manufacturing, assembling and fabricating character. These tend to be large-scale or specialized industrial operations more likely to produce external physical effects impacting to some degree surrounding districts. This district is intended to be located in areas where the allowed uses can most efficiently utilize major roadways, utilities and other infrastructure, while minimizing potentially incompatible influences upon neighboring districts. Like the M-1 district, the M-2 district is also intended to support the economic vitality of the city through job creation and tax revenues.

ARTICLE 10. - FORM-BASED CODE DISTRICTS

Sec. 10-1. - Purpose and guiding principles.
new
A.
Purposes. Palmetto's form-based districts provide specific regulations to achieve the following:
1.
Develop a fully integrated, mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented environment with traditional residential neighborhoods and a traditional downtown with buildings containing commercial, residential and office uses.
2.
Create a synergy of uses within the downtown area, supporting economic development and redevelopment.
3.
Calm traffic, thereby creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment and preventing a clustering of auto-oriented uses.
4.
Regulate building height and placement to achieve appropriate scale along streets and ensure a proper transition between the different areas of the city.
5.
Establish clear controls on building form and placement to frame a well-defined public realm comprised of human-scale streets, neighborhoods and public spaces, all of which contribute to creating a safe, comfortable and livable environment.
B.
Form-based Districts. A form-based code is established for the core area of Palmetto, which is divided into the following districts:
1.
Residential Form-based Districts.
a.
R-3A Traditional Residential District. The Traditional Residential District supports a predominantly single-family residential setting and preserves the traditional development patterns of the area. The intent of this district is to retain the period character of Palmetto's older neighborhoods. The R-3A District also includes currently undeveloped land, envisioned to be an extension of traditional residential development patterns.
b.
R-3B Mill Village Residential District. The Mill Village Residential District consists of historic dwellings built for cotton industry workers and is predominantly single-family. This district is characterized by modest worker housing with a distinctive and historic style that reflects Palmetto's heritage as a cotton milling and production center.
2.
C-2 Central Business District. The Central Business District protects the traditional, small town character of downtown Palmetto and enhances a pedestrian-oriented environment. The district accommodates a mix of retail stores, offices, entertainment, public spaces, residential uses and related activities that are mutually supporting and serve the needs of the community. The intent of this district is to encourage a lively social environment and economically viable downtown with a wide variety of uses in a pedestrian-oriented and unified setting.
C.
Requirements. All requirements of this ordinance shall apply within the form-based districts, except as modified by this article. If regulations elsewhere within this ordinance conflict or appear to conflict with the regulations in this article, the regulations of this article shall apply.
D.
Components of this Article. The article is comprised of Use Regulations, a Form-based District Regulating Plan, Lot Area, Siting, and Height Requirements, Architectural Standards, and Accessory Provisions (including parking, landscaping and sign requirements) as described below:
1.
Use Regulations. Uses in the form based districts are listed in Section 10-2. Those uses listed as conditional or special uses are subject to the review and approval requirements of Articles 14 and 15.
2.
Regulating Plan.
a.
A regulating plan provides standards for each property and illustrates how each relates to adjacent properties and the street. The regulating plan is the coding key for the form-based districts; it is similar to a zoning map but it provides specific information on permitted development for each property.
b.
The regulating plan identifies the form district for each property, which in turn determines the lot area, siting and height requirements for all building sites. The regulating plan also shows how each lot relates to public spaces and surrounding neighborhoods. There may be additional regulations for lots in special locations as identified on the regulating plan.
c.
The regulating plan determines the frontage street for each lot in the form districts, along which the required building line (RBL) shall apply. Principal structures shall face the frontage street. Yards (front, side, rear) shall be determined according to the frontage street.
d.
The boundaries of the form-based districts on the regulating plan shall be the same as those shown on the Official Zoning Map. Therefore, any change to the boundaries of the form-based districts shall be reviewed and approved according to the map amendment (rezoning) process in Section 21-10. The regulating plan shall be revised upon approval of any rezoning or change to the form-based district boundaries on the Official Zoning Map.
E.
Lot Area, Siting, and Height Standards.
1.
The lot area, siting and height requirements establish basic parameters governing building form, including the envelope for building placement (in three dimensions) and certain required or permitted building elements, such as shop fronts, doors, windows, balconies, and street walls. The lot area, siting and height standards establish both the boundaries within which things may be done and specific things that must be done. The applicable lot area, siting and height standard for a lot or parcel is determined by its street frontage, as designated on the regulating plan.
2.
The lot area, siting and height requirements shape public spaces throughout each form-based district through placement and envelope controls on buildings that frame streets. The standards aim for the minimum level of control necessary to meet that goal.
a.
Architectural Standards. The goal of the architectural standards is to promote a coherent and pleasing architectural character that is complementary to the best regional traditions. The standards govern a building's architectural elements regardless of its building envelope standards and set the parameters for allowable materials and configurations. Equivalent or better products than those specified are always encouraged and may be submitted for approval.
b.
Accessory Standards. The accessory standards govern development standards related to parking, site landscaping, signs and other accessory aspects of development within the form-based districts.
F.
How to Use this Code. Understanding how each property within the respective districts is regulated requires the following steps:
1.
Look at the regulating plan. Find the property and note the required building line or lines. Note the color of the fronting street-space, this determines the form based district for the property, which contains the lot area, siting and height requirements for buildings fronting that street.
2.
Review the use regulations. The use table describes the allowed uses within each form-based district.
3.
Review the lot area, siting, and height standards. These regulate siting of buildings and parking.
4.
Review the architectural standards. These define permitted building materials and architectural forms.
5.
Determine the accessory standards applying to the property. These list requirements for landscaping, lighting, and signs, among others.
6.
Submit plans for approval to the zoning administrator. Developments that conform to the standards and requirements of this article can be approved administratively, unless a special land use is also required. Projects that deviate from the standards may be approved, but are subject to site plan review by the planning and zoning board. Section 10-9 describes the processes.
Sec. 10-2. - Schedule of uses.
new
A.
Uses shall be permitted based upon the district. Land and/or buildings in the districts indicated at the top of Table 10-2 may be used for the purposes denoted by the following abbreviations:

( Ord. No. 2013-02 , § 5, 4-1-2013)
Sec. 10-3. - Residential form-based districts (R-3A and R-3B).
new
A.
Applicability. The form-based requirements for the residential districts apply to properties with frontage on existing streets, as shown on the Regulating Plan. Any lot or parcel created after the effective date of this ordinance shall be subject to the requirements of Section 10-7.
B.
Purpose and Intent. Implementation of the dimensional requirements of the residential form-based districts realizes a complementary residential development pattern that is based on traditional neighborhood design principles. It also ensures that a consistent architectural character is maintained and the street is neither dominated nor defined by imposing garages that project beyond the front façade of a building. Such a pattern will additionally help support a walkable, pedestrian environment and promote neighborhood accessibility. By regulating building character, facades can be located closer to a street and sidewalk and be aligned to form an edge that frames the public realm, while retaining sufficient room for people to walk and mingle with neighbors. Further, as expressed by traditional architectural forms, defined building entrances, window openings, materials and heights, new structures can be designed to blend with existing homes, thereby enhancing the character of residential neighborhoods.
C.

new
A.
Purpose and Intent. By regulating building elements, facades can be aligned along streets and sidewalks to form a street edge that frames the public realm, while retaining a sufficient dimension to accommodate pedestrians, shoppers and outdoor diners. Strong architectural character should be reflected in the design of buildings by clearly defining a base, middle and roof line. Traditional storefronts should be expressed by their distinct front entries, ample window openings and appropriate building heights. Facades visible from streets and other public spaces must be divided by rhythmic architectural elements to define scale and include customary architectural features, such as awnings, cornices, columns, trim details or other character elements.
B.
Applicability. The architectural standards for specific building types shall apply in addition to any lot area, siting, and height standards for the individual form-based districts.

new
A.
Intent. The subdivision of existing lots and the development of any lot or parcel that does not front on a street in existence on the effective date of this ordinance shall be subject to the requirements of this section. This section ensures undeveloped lands within form-based districts are developed in a manner consistent with traditional development patterns, block sizes and architectural character. Diverse block and lot sizes can help create an urban form that accommodates various housing types in a pedestrian friendly manner. Short blocks, defined by a traditional grid street layout, can yield multiple travel routes and choices that are more direct and safer for pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists. Lot and block design should promote development that is compatible with natural features, minimizes pedestrian and vehicular conflicts, promotes street life and activity, reinforces public spaces, promotes public safety, and visually enhances development.
B.
Existing Lots. A building containing a use allowed in the district and meeting the requirements of this article may be developed on a lot or parcel existing on the effective date of this ordinance, provided the lot or parcel can be accessed in accordance with Section 13-2.B. The building shall conform to the lot area, siting and building height requirements, architectural standards and accessory provisions applying to the district in which the property is located.
C.
New Subdivisions. A new lot or parcel shall not be created unless it fronts on a street in existence on the effective date of this ordinance, except in the R-3A District, as follows. All subdivisions, including minor and estate subdivisions, shall conform to the requirements of Appendix A of the Code of the City of Palmetto, except as modified by this section. Where the requirements of this section conflict or differ with any other requirements of the city, the requirements of this section shall prevail.
D.
R-3A District. An applicant seeking approval of a subdivision in the R-3A District shall submit a plan showing all proposed streets, lots and street extensions necessary to also serve adjacent undeveloped properties within the R-3A District. The plan for the subject property shall comply with the following minimum standards:
1.
Streets and Blocks.
a.
Streets shall be designed to implement the requirements of the R-3A District.
b.
Multiple street connections to and from a subject property shall integrate existing and planned streets and provide access to adjacent properties.
c.
Planned street extensions shall terminate at property lines to serve future development on adjacent property. A street terminating at a lot line shall interconnect with any future development.
d.
Streets shall be designed as an interconnected grid network and shall not result in cul-de-sacs or dead end streets, except as required in subparagraph c, above. Where possible, the design of streets should consider terminating vistas, interesting views and variety in the streetscape.
e.
Blocks that are defined by the street network shall be in the range of 200—400 feet deep by 400—800 feet long.
f.
Right-of-way widths shall be 50 feet. Pavement widths shall be no greater than 28 feet.
g.
Streets may intersect at angles less than 90 degrees, provided that adequate site distance for all turning movements is provided.
h.
Alleys for rear access to lots are permitted.
2.
Lots. Lots shall conform to the requirements of the R-3A District and comply with the following:
a.
A variety of lot sizes meeting or exceeding the district requirements should be provided to facilitate housing diversity and choice and meet the projected requirements of people with different housing needs.
b.
Lot widths should create a relatively symmetrical street cross section that reinforces the street as a simple, unified public space.
3.
Other Requirements.
a.
Sidewalks are required on both sides of all streets.
b.
Street lighting shall be designed to enhance vehicle and pedestrian safety and shall use fixtures and supports that are in character with the form-based district.
c.
Landscaping shall be provided to create transitions between the public realm of the street and sidewalk and the front yards and porches of dwellings. Canopy street trees shall be used to frame the streetscape.
4.
Procedure. A preliminary development plan that shows how the requirements of this section are met shall be approved prior to submittal of a preliminary plat of subdivision, minor subdivision or estate subdivision. The plan shall include the following:
a.
A preliminary survey, drawn to scale by a licensed surveyor or civil engineer, showing the proposed layout of lots, streets and public spaces.
b.
The plan shall show compliance with all of the requirements of this section and shall be accompanied by descriptions, specifications and other documents that show how the requirements of this section are met.
c.
The planning and zoning board shall review the preliminary development plan and shall recommend approval, approval with conditions or denial of the plan to the city council. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning board, the city council shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the preliminary development plan. If the plan is approved with conditions, the applicant shall submit a revised plan reflecting the approved conditions for final approval by the city council prior to submitting a preliminary plat of subdivision, minor plat or estate plat.
d.
The planning and zoning board and the city council shall find that:
1.
The preliminary development plan conforms in all ways with the requirements of this section;
2.
The arrangement of streets and lots reflects the intent and character of the R-3A District;
3.
Streets are arranged so that they can be extended into adjacent undeveloped properties and will provide for an efficient street grid that reflects the intent and character of the R-3A District.
4.
The subdivision is designed to account for development of all of the undeveloped area in the R-3A District and not just the property in question, so that the completed development will be cohesive and shall be an extension of the currently developed R-3A District areas.
e.
A preliminary plat, minor plat or estate plat shall be submitted for the property in question within one year of approval of the preliminary development plan. The planning and zoning board may approve one extension of up to one year, if the applicant can show that the delay is due to factors beyond the control of the applicant. Upon expiration of one year or upon expiration of any granted extension, the preliminary development plan shall lapse and any future development shall require approval of a new preliminary development plan.
f.
The preliminary and final plats of subdivision (or the minor or estate subdivision) shall conform to the approved preliminary development plan. Any deviation from or amendment to the approved plan shall be approved via the same process as the original approval. Upon approval of the preliminary plat of subdivision, minor plat or estate plat, the Regulating Plan shall be revised accordingly.
Sec. 10-8. - Variances and deviations.

A.
Administrative Approvals. An administrative approval provides an incentive to applicants who develop projects or sites within form-based districts that fully comply with all of the requirements of this article, without deviations or variances, and do not require conditional or special land use review or approval.
1.
The zoning administrator shall have the authority to make an administrative approval. The zoning administrator shall consult with designated representatives of other city departments, as deemed necessary, before making an administrative approval.
2.
Upon receiving a completed application, the zoning administrator shall administratively approve the plan, or shall inform the applicant in writing as to why the administrative approval has not been granted.
3.
Permits for building or site development shall not be submitted or applied for until administrative approval has been granted.
4.
Decisions by the zoning administrator may be appealed to the zoning board of appeals.
5.
The zoning administrator may elect to submit a plan for a level "B" site plan review, in accordance with Article 20, even if it is eligible for administrative approval when the scale or effect of the project is deemed significant enough to warrant such review.
B.
Variances. All variances listed in Table 10-8 shall be considered by the zoning board of appeals, in accordance with Article 23.
C.
Deviations from Form Based District Requirements. Any deviation from these Building Envelope Standards, Architectural Standards or Accessory Standards, other than those specified for a variance in Table 10-8, shall cause the plan to be reviewed as a level "B" site plan, in accordance with Article 20.
1.
A deviation from requirements not listed as variances shall be reviewed under the requirements of this subsection.
2.
The planning and zoning board and city council shall not have the authority to change part of a site plan that meets the development requirements of the district.
3.
In determining if a deviation is warranted, the planning and zoning board and city council shall consider the following:
a.
Deviations shall be permitted when an applicant demonstrates that the resulting design is superior in terms of compatibility with surrounding structures and better fits the character of the area than when it conforms to form-based requirements.
b.
The city council may also allow deviations when the applicant shows that conformance with the form-based requirements is impractical due to existing building or site layouts or on adjacent sites, where the deviation has no exterior effect, or where the deviation is necessary to meet other laws or regulations.
c.
The deviation shall be the least necessary to achieve the results in either subparagraphs 1 or 2, above.
d.
Cost, convenience or franchise/corporate designs shall not, by themselves, be reasons for granting a deviation.
e.
The planning and zoning board may grant a lesser deviation than requested.
f.
When approving a deviation, the planning and zoning board may attach conditions necessary to meet the requirements of this section and to uphold the intent of this article.
D.
Conditional and Special Use Procedures. Within the form-based districts, conditional and special land uses shall be considered according to the requirements and procedures specified in the zoning ordinance. Where the requirements of this article conflict with the requirements in Articles 14 and 15, the requirements of this article shall prevail.
Sec. 10-10. - Nonconformities in the form-based districts.
new
A.
Existing uses, structures (other than signs) and lots that do not conform to the standards of the form-based districts shall be subject to the regulations of Article 24, except that the following provisions shall apply:
1.
C-2 District. Any expansion of a nonconforming structure greater than 25 percent of the gross leasable area of the existing building or any expansion or renovation of such structure greater than 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure at the time of the expansion shall require the entire structure to meet the requirements of the form-based district. For any expansion, the more restrictive of these two criteria shall be controlling. For the purposes of this subsection:
a.
Expansion of a nonconforming structure shall be undertaken only one time per structure without requiring compliance with the code.
b.
The assessed value shall be determined at the time of the proposed expansion.
c.
An expansion on the front of a nonconforming building does not increase the extent of nonconformity if the expansion is at the same or less distance to the required build-to line as is the existing structure.
d.
Façade alterations to existing buildings or expansions that comply with the required build-to line shall also comply with the architectural standards of this article.
e.
Repair and maintenance work shall be allowed without regard to subparagraph 1, above. Such exempt activities include roof replacement, window replacement and maintenance, mechanical and electrical upgrades, interior fit out (tenant improvement work), parking resurfacing and other site work, such as stormwater improvements, landscaping, and site amenities. Any such expansion or site improvements shall nevertheless not occur outside of the required build-to lines of the property.
f.
A structure destroyed by any means by more than 50 percent of its value prior to such destruction shall be replaced only by a structure that conforms to the requirements of the form-based district; however, this does not preclude the property owner from seeking variances or deviations as provided by this article.
g.
Parking lots, bicycle facilities, loading areas, landscaping, screening, and other site improvements shall be considered structures for the purposes of these provisions.
2.
R-3A and R-3B Districts.
a.
Non-residential uses and structures in the R-3A and R-3B Districts shall be subject to the same requirements as for all nonconforming uses and structures in the C-2 District.

ARTICLE 11. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS

Sec. 11-1. - Intent and scope.
new
A.
Intent. The intent of the overlay districts is to establish regulations in addition to the applicable regulations of the existing (underlying) zoning district that either supplement or replace those existing regulations. The Overlay Districts are applied in specific locations based on the environmental features, historic assets, traffic conditions or other unique characteristics of the area, regardless of the established zoning districts.
B.
Scope. Several overlay districts are established, as described in this article, to address the varied and unique needs of specific locations within the city. The boundaries of these districts shall be as described in this article and shown on the zoning map. The requirements of this article are in addition to and shall supplement those imposed on the same lands by any underlying zoning provisions of this ordinance or other ordinances of the City of Palmetto. These regulations supersede all conflicting regulations of the underlying districts to the extent of such conflict.
Sec. 11-2. - Arterial corridor overlay.
new
A.
Purpose. Certain arterial roadways within the city have been identified in the comprehensive plan as important gateways and areas of economic opportunity.

  a.
Minimum spacing between two commercial driveways shall be determined based upon posted speed limits along the parcel frontage. The minimum spacing indicated in Table 11-2b. is measured from centerline to centerline.
b.
To reduce left-turn conflicts, new commercial driveways shall be aligned with those across the street, where possible. If alignment is not possible, driveways shall be offset from those on the opposite side of the street a minimum of 250 feet along arterial streets and 150 feet along collector and local streets. These standards may be reduced by the reviewing authority where there is insufficient frontage and shared access with an adjacent site is not feasible. Longer offsets may be required depending on the expected inbound left-turn volumes of the driveways.
4.
Modification of Requirements.
a.
Given the variation in existing physical conditions along arterials and the intersecting streets, modifications to the spacing and other requirements above may be permitted by the reviewing authority, as part of the site plan review. The reviewing authority shall consider the criteria in subparagraph 3.b. when determining if there is a need for modification, in the following circumstances, and the degree to which any modification is necessary:
1.
The modification will allow an existing driveway to remain that does not meet the standards of this section but that has, or is expected to have very low traffic volumes (less than 50 in- and out-bound trips per day) and is not expected to significantly impact safe traffic operations.
2.
The use is expected to generate a relatively high number of trips and an additional driveway will improve overall traffic operations.
3.
Practical difficulties exist on the site that make compliance unreasonable (sight distance limitations, existing development, topography, unique site configuration or shape), or existing off-site driveways make it impractical to fully comply with the standards.
4.
Because of restricted turning movements or presence of a median that restricts turning movements, the driveway does not contribute to congestion or an unsafe situation.
b.
The reviewing authority may waive certain requirements of this section upon consideration of the following:
1.
The proposed modification is consistent with the general intent of the standards of this overlay zone, the recommendations of the Palmetto Comprehensive Plan, and, if applicable, published GDOT guidelines.
2.
Driveway geometrics have been improved to the extent practical to reduce impacts on traffic flow.
3.
Shared access has been provided, or the applicant has demonstrated it is not practical.
4.
Such modification is the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access, will not impair public safety or prevent the logical development or redevelopment of adjacent sites and is not simply for convenience of the development.
5.
Commercial Driveways Permitted.
a.
The number of commercial driveways serving a property shall be the minimum number necessary to provide reasonable access and access for emergency vehicles, while preserving traffic operations and safety along the public street.
b.
Access shall be provided for each separately owned parcel. Access may be via an individual driveway, shared driveway or service drive. Additional driveways may be permitted for property only as follows:
1.
One additional driveway may be allowed for properties with a continuous frontage greater than 300 feet, if the reviewing authority determines there are no other reasonable access alternatives;
2.
The reviewing authority determines additional access is justified without compromising traffic operations along the public street; and
3.
The minimum spacing requirements, specified in Table 11-3b. can be met.
6.
Commercial Driveway Design.
a.
All commercial driveways shall be designed according to the standards of the City of Palmetto or Georgia Department of Transportation, as applicable.
b.
For high traffic generators, or for commercial driveways along streets experiencing or expected to experience congestion, the reviewing authority may require two egress lanes.
c.
Where a boulevard entrance is proposed by the applicant or required by the reviewing authority, a fully curbed island shall separate the ingress and egress lanes. The radii forming the edges on this island shall be designed to accommodate the largest vehicle that will use the driveway. The minimum area of the island shall be 180 square feet. The reviewing authority may require landscaping, tolerant of street conditions, on the section outside the public right-of-way.
7.
Shared Driveways, Frontage Roads and Service Roads.
a.
Where noted above, or where the reviewing authority determines that reducing the number of access points may have a beneficial impact on traffic operations and safety while preserving the property owner's right to reasonable access, a shared commercial driveway, frontage road or rear service drive connecting two or more properties or uses may be required. In particular, service drives may be required near existing traffic signals or locations having potential for future signalization; along arterial streets with high traffic volumes; and along street segments with a relatively high number of crashes or limited sight distance.
b.
Shared commercial driveways and service roads shall be within a recorded access easement. A draft of the access easement shall be provided to the city for review prior to filing.
c.
The number of access points along a service road shall be according to the standards of this section. The reviewing authority may allow temporary access where the service road is not completed if a financial guarantee is provided which assures elimination of the temporary access upon completion of the service road. Building permits shall not be issued until the financial guarantee has been submitted to the city.
8.
Service Road Design Standards.
a.
Location. Service roads shall generally be parallel to the front property line and may be located either in front of, adjacent to, or behind principal buildings. In considering the most appropriate alignment for a service road, the reviewing authority shall consider the setbacks of existing buildings and anticipated traffic flow for the site. However, placement of the service road intersection with the driveway from the abutting arterial should be as far as possible from the arterial for safe, more efficient operation. The distance between the roadway traffic and the first internal movement shall meet the minimum requirements shown in Table 11-2c. For large sites with high volumes or heavy truck traffic, and along high volume roadways, the required distance may be increased to avoid interference with the mainline traffic flow. If no other design alternatives exist, the reviewing authority may permit lesser separation distances, provided the left turning movement shall be prevented by means of a raised concrete median. Sites shall be designed so interior driveways accommodate at least 100 feet of storage.

EXPAND
Lot Depth (feet) Minimum Required Distance (feet)
1,000 or more 200
500—999 Not less than ⅕ lot depth
Less than 500 100
  b.
Access Easement. The service road shall be within an access easement permitting traffic circulation between properties. This easement shall be 60 feet wide, except an access easement parallel to a public street right-of-way may be 40 feet wide, if approved by the reviewing authority. The required width shall remain free and clear of obstructions, unless otherwise approved by the reviewing authority.
c.
Construction and Materials. Service roads shall have a base, pavement and curb with gutter in accordance with city standards for public streets, except the width of the service road shall have a minimum pavement width of 26 feet.
d.
Parking. The service road is intended to be used exclusively for circulation, not as a parking maneuvering aisle. The reviewing authority may require the posting of "no parking" signs along the service road. In reviewing the site plan, the reviewing authority may permit temporary parking in the easement area where a continuous service road is not yet available, provided that the layout allows removal of the parking in the future to allow extension of the service road.
e.
Access to Service Road. The reviewing authority shall approve the location of all access points to the service road, based on the driveway spacing standards listed in Table 11-3b.
f.
Elevation. The site plan shall indicate the proposed elevation of the service road at the property line and the city shall maintain a record of all service road elevations so their grades can be coordinated.
g.
Landscaping. The area between a service road and the public street right-of-way shall be planted as a landscaped greenbelt as specified in Section 19-4.
h.
Maintenance. Each property owner shall be responsible for maintenance of the easement and service road.
Sec. 11-3. - Watershed overlay.
new
A.
Purpose. In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public and provide a sound economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city.
B.
Applicability. The city water supply watershed district is hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains to the city water supply reservoir. The boundaries of these overlays are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the city water supply reservoir. These overlays shall be further delineated and defined on the Water Supply Watershed Protection District Overlay Map of the city. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and their boundaries shall be identified on the Water Supply Watershed District Overlay Map.

ARTICLE 12. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 12-1. - Purpose.
new
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is established as an optional development tool to permit flexibility in the regulation of land development; to encourage innovation in land use, form of ownership and variety of design, layout and type of structures constructed; to achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land; to preserve farmland, significant natural, historical and architectural features and open space; to promote efficient provision of public services and utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts; to provide better housing, employment and shopping opportunities particularly suited to residents; to encourage development of convenient recreational facilities; and to encourage the use and improvement of existing sites when the uniform regulations contained in other zoning districts alone do not provide adequate protection and safeguards for the site and surrounding areas. It is the further intent of the PUD regulations to promote a higher quality of development than can be achieved from conventional zoning requirements in furtherance of the vision and goals of the adopted Palmetto comprehensive plan.
Sec. 12-2. - Qualifying conditions.
new
In order to qualify for PUD approval, the applicant shall demonstrate, in writing, that each of the following criteria is or will be met by the proposed PUD:

B.
Size. Each PUD shall contain a minimum of 30 acres. If the PUD contains a mix of residential and non-residential (commercial or industrial) uses, the minimum size shall be 60 acres. Sites containing less than the minimum required acres, but no less than 50 percent of the requirement, may be considered for rezoning to PUD, if the city council determines that the site will advance the purposes of the PUD District. When determining the appropriateness of areas less than the applicable minimum required, the city council shall determine that rezoning the area to PUD will not result in a significant adverse effect upon nearby or adjacent city lands; the proposed uses will complement the character of the surrounding area; the purpose and qualifying conditions of the PUD District can be achieved within a smaller area; and the PUD is not being used as a means to circumvent conventional zoning requirements.
C.
Utilities. The PUD shall be served by public water and sanitary sewer.
D.
Ownership. The PUD application shall be filed by the property owner, lessee or other person with legal interest in the property and written consent by the owner. The proposed development shall be under unified ownership or control, so one person or entity has proprietary responsibility for the full completion of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions indicating that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed.
E.
Comprehensive Plan. Proposed uses within the PUD shall be substantially consistent with the future development map of the city's adopted comprehensive plan.
F.
Pedestrian Accommodation. The PUD shall provide for integrated, safe and abundant pedestrian access and movement within the PUD and to adjacent properties.

  1. See section 12-3.D and E for regulations pertaining to previously approved developments.
B.
Residential Units Allowed. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted within the PUD shall be computed as the gross area of the underlying residential zoning district(s) multiplied by the "maximum residential density" permitted for that zoning district in Table 12-3. The gross area of the underlying zoning district shall not include existing street rights-of-way, wetlands, water bodies or 100-year flood plain, utility easements or other easements that prohibit buildings. If a property contains more than one residential zoning district with different density limits, the number of units allowed shall be the aggregate of each of the residential districts calculated separately.
C.
Minimum Lot Size and Zoning Requirements. Unless altered, in accordance with Section 12-4.E., the lot area, width, setbacks, height, lot coverage, minimum floor area, parking, landscaping, lighting and other provisions for the district in effect immediately prior to the rezoning to PUD shall be applicable for all uses proposed as part of a PUD. In no case shall a variation of the requirements, however, result in a greater density of residential units than permitted by Section 12-3.B.
D.
Foxhall Village Planned Unit Development. Prior to the adoption of this ordinance, the Foxhall Village PUD was proposed and reviewed pursuant to the State of Georgia requirements and procedures for developments of regional impact (DRI). Having undergone that process and having received authorization based on specific development parameters, the property designated as the Foxhall Village PUD is hereby zoned "planned unit development."
1.
Development Parameters. It is recognized that some elements of the previously reviewed project may not fully comport with the provisions of this article. Therefore, the following parameters are established for the Foxhall Village PUD and shall govern its development, except as otherwise specifically provided.

3.
Conditions.
a.
In order to provide some degree of flexibility, a variation of up to five percent shall be permitted for any of the development parameters specified in Table 12-3a; provided the area of the PUD site shall not be increased or decreased. Any adjustment exceeding five percent shall require city council approval and may be cause for the city to initiate a change in zoning of all or part of the property.
b.
The PUD zoning of this property is based on its single ownership and the stated intent to develop the entire site as a planned development, consistent with the parameters specified in Table 12-3a. Therefore, any increase or decrease in the area of the proposed PUD or any sale or transfer of any portion of the total property shall nullify the provisions of this subsection, 12-3.D, and may be cause for the city council to initiate a change in zoning of all or part of the property. In any case, the allowed development parameters of Table 12-3a would no longer be in effect.
4.
Plan Review and Approval. The Foxhall PUD shall be subject to the review and approval procedures of Section 12-5, except for rezoning the property, and all other applicable provisions of this article, unless specifically waived or modified herein.
E.
Existing Planned Developments. Within the City of Palmetto there are two previously approved planned developments, Weldon Park and Princeton Village, identified on the zoning map as PUD. These developments shall be exempt from the requirements of this article and shall conform to the prior approved development plans for those specific projects. However, any expansion to or modification of the existing approved developments that constitutes a major change as defined in Section 12-7 shall be subject to the applicable requirements of Section 12-5.
Sec. 12-4. - General PUD provisions.
new
A.
Conditions. The planning and zoning board may recommend and the city council may impose reasonable conditions upon the PUD approval. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, those necessary to ensure public services and facilities will be capable of accommodating increased loads; to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy; to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of land; be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of this ordinance; be related to the standards established in the ordinance for the proposed PUD; be necessary to ensure compliance with the final development plan and the provisions of this ordinance. The conditions imposed shall be recorded in the minutes of the approval action, and shall remain unchanged except upon amendment of the PUD in accordance with the procedures of Section 12-7.
B.
Performance Guarantees. The planning and zoning board may recommend and the city council may require reasonable performance guarantees, in accordance with Section 21-5 of this ordinance to ensure completion of specified improvements within the PUD.
C.
Interior Streets. Public or private streets may be required to be extended to exterior lot lines in order to allow connection to existing or planned streets on adjacent parcels, so as to provide for secondary access, continuity of the circulation system and to reduce traffic on collector streets.
D.
Time Limits. Each PUD shall be under construction within 12 months after the date of approval of the final development plan. If this requirement is not met, the city council may, in its discretion, grant one extension not exceeding up to 12 additional months; provided that prior to the expiration of the initial 12-month period, the applicant submits reasonable evidence in writing to the effect that unforeseen difficulties or special circumstances have been encountered, causing delay in commencement of the PUD. If the PUD has not been commenced within the initial 12 month approval period, or within any authorized extension thereof, any building permits issued for the PUD or any part thereof shall be of no further effect. At the expiration of the applicable period of time, the planning and zoning board or city council may initiate proceedings for the rezoning of the lands to some other zoning district.
E.
Variations from Minimum Requirements. District regulations applicable to a land use in a PUD may be altered from those of the district(s) in effect immediately prior to the PUD rezoning, including but not limited to, modification from the lot area and width, building setbacks, height, lot coverage, signs and parking. The applicant for a PUD shall identify, in writing, all intended variations from the prior zoning being proposed. Variations may be approved during the preliminary development plan review by the city council, after planning and zoning board recommendation. These adjustments may be permitted only if they will result in a higher quality of development or in better integration of the proposed use(s) with surrounding uses. The variations shall also satisfy one or more of the following criteria:
1.
Preserves the best natural features of the site;
2.
Creates, maintains or improves habitat for wildlife;
3.
Creates, improves or maintains open space for the residents;
4.
Enhances the views into the site as well as the view from dwellings to be built on site; and
5.
