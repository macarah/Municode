ARTICLE XVII. - CBD, CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT

Sec. 1701. - Purpose and intent.
The intent of this Article is to establish and preserve a compact central business district convenient and attractive for a wide range of retail uses, business transactions, government and professional offices, places of amusement, employment activities, and services to the public designed primarily to meet the day-to-day shopping and service needs of residents of the City of Dahlonega.
It is further the intent of this Article to ensure that development within the Central Business District is consistent or compatible with development in the B-3, Historical Business District. The Governing Body finds that, due to the proximity of the Central Business District (CBD) to the historic downtown square, that development within the Central Business District could either substantially enhance or threaten the character and economic conditions of the historic downtown square, depending upon the type, nature and architectural character of such development. Because of the potential impact development within the CBD could have on the long term economic vitality of properties within the B-3, Historical Business District, which such historical properties are found to be of utmost importance to tourism and the economies of Dahlonega and Lumpkin County, the Governing Body finds that all alterations to structures and development of new structures within this district shall require a review according to the guidelines of the City of Dahlonega Historic Preservation Ordinance. This is required to ensure the integrity, stability and enhancement of the B-3, Historical Business District. (See Section 1705.)
