An employee may not provide to anyone or permit others to use confidential or personal information except in the performance of the employee's official duties. Our ethics require employees to maintain the highest degree of confidentiality. Do not disclose personal or confidential information to anyone. The impression the public has of our city is based, in part, on how we care for records. We respect the confidence we are entrusted and ensure files are handled with care. As authorized, obtain material from files then return back to files in the same condition as received. No request for file information can be fulfilled absent clerk approval.
(c)
Social security number (SSN) privacy and personal information. No employee may acquire, disclose or unlawfully use SSN, address, phone number, email address, internet name or password, parent's surname prior to marriage or driver's license number of anyone except per city policy. The release of personal identifying information to external parties is prohibited unless required by law. Internal access to SSN is restricted to legitimate city need. SSN will not be posted, displayed, or printed on any identification badge or time card. SSN may be collected in the ordinary course of city business for identity verification or to administer benefits and per laws. Records that include SSN will be maintained per laws. Documents that include SSN and are to be discarded should be destroyed by shredding or data scrubbing before disposal.

Sec. 2-419. - Appearance during work hours; neat workplace; searches.
(a)
While the city does not specify a citywide dress code, employees are expected to be clean and neat in appearance during work hours. As representatives of the city, employees should present a business-like professional image. Dress code policies may be established within individual departments. In certain types of jobs, employees may be required to wear uniforms. The city may designate specific days as "casual days." Dress on casual days may be less formal, but should always be clean, neat, and suitable for the workplace.
(b)
Lettered or illustrated clothing shall not promote a political, moral, religious, personal or other opinion. Clothing which is obscene, vulgar, offensive, or inflammatory is prohibited. Employees may be required to change inappropriate dress or instructed not to wear the same or similar in the future. The city may require employees to wear identification badges issued by the human resources office while at work or on duty. Employees are not to wear these identification badges while away from work or off-duty.
(c)
Good habits and a neat workplace are essential for job safety and efficiency. Keep the workplace organized and in good order. Report anything that needs repair or replacement to the clerk or supervisor. To ensure safety of all, the city may conduct personal searches per law, and inspect any possessions or articles. The city may search any office, desk, files, locker, equipment or any other area or article. All these are the property of the city, and issued only for employment. Persons entering who refuse to cooperate with a search may not be permitted to enter.

City property is to be used for work-related reasons only. Employees are not to use, misuse or permit the use of city property for other than work-related reasons. City property includes, but is not limited to, computers, telephones, copiers or other equipment, supplies, vehicles, work areas and furniture. All office supplies will be provided for city use only and should not be removed from the office. If you need additional items not regularly stocked, speak to the clerk.
(b)
Use proper care with city property/equipment. No property may be removed without approval of clerk. Should an employee lose, break or damage property, report to the clerk at once.

Sec. 2-421. - Gifts and gratuities.
An employee shall not accept gifts, gratuities, or loans from organizations, business concerns, or individuals with whom the employee has official relationships on business of the city government. These limitations do not prohibit the acceptance of articles of negligible value which are distributed generally, nor do they prohibit employees from obtaining loans from regular lending institutions. An employee should not accept any gift over $25.00 in value in any one year from any single individual, corporation, business, or interest group.
(Ord. of 3-6-2020, ch. 6(E))
Sec. 2-422. - Conflict of interest.
Employees shall refrain from unfavorable relationships which might be construed as evidence of favoritism, coercion, unfair advantage or collusion. When an employee is faced with a situation which is questionable or problematical with regard to posing a conflict of interest, that employee shall discuss it with the supervisor who may, in turn, refer the matter to human resources. A city's reputation for integrity is its most valuable asset and is directly related to conduct of its employees. Employees must never use their positions with the city, or its clients, for private gain, to advance personal interests, to obtain favors or benefits, or engage in activities, investments or associations that interfere with an employee's judgment concerning the city's best interests, or exploit an employee's position with the city for personal gain. The city adheres to the highest legal and ethical standards applicable. The city follows strict observance of the letter and spirit of the law. The integrity of each employee is of utmost importance. Employees shall conduct personal affairs so their duties and responsibilities are not jeopardized and legal questions do not arise.

Sec. 2-424. - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discriminating against disabled individuals in regard to the terms or conditions of employment, including the application and hiring process, if the individual is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation. To comply with the ADA, the city will make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities per the ADA when such reasonable accommodations will permit those employees to perform the essential functions of their respective jobs. The city is not required by ADA to provide an accommodation when a direct threat of harm to the employee or others remains. Employees who believe they are disabled, and who require a reasonable accommodation, should inform their supervisor and human resources.

(4)
Immediately report any harassing or discriminating behavior by non-employees. Anyone who experiences or observes harassment, discrimination, or retaliation should report it to the clerk. If an employee makes a report to the clerk and that person does not respond satisfactorily, report the situation to another city official. Report any actions that are believed to violate policy no matter how slight they may seem. We will investigate and take prompt, appropriate action. The city will protect the confidentiality of those reporting suspected violations to the extent possible consistent with our investigation. Employees won't be penalized or retaliated against for reporting improper conduct, harassment, discrimination, or retaliation. We cannot resolve a violation unless we know about it.

If the complaint involves someone in the employee's direct line of command, the employee should go to human resources with the complaint. Any supervisor observing or having knowledge of any harassment, sexual or not, must immediately report the matter to human resources. All harassment complaints will be promptly investigated. Confidentiality will be maintained to the greatest extent possible. When justified, appropriate corrective action will be taken, including termination of any person engaging in harassment, to remedy all violations of this policy. Any retaliation taken as a result of a person making a complaint under this policy is strictly prohibited.
