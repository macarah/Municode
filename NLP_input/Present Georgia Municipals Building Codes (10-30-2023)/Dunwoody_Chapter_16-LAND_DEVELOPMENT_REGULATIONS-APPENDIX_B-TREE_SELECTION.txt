APPENDIX B - TREE SELECTION
(1)
Trees selected for planting must meet minimum requirements as provided below and in the American Standard of Nursery Stock.
(2)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, or nutritional disorders.
(3)
Trees selected for planting must be of good vigor. The determination of vigor is a subjective evaluation, and dependent upon species variability. The following criteria is generally used for the determination of vigor:
(4)
Foliage should have a green or dark green color. Vigorous trees will have large leaves and dense foliage when compared to trees with poor vigor.
(5)
Shoot growth for most vigorous trees will be at least one foot per year. At least one-half of the branches should arise from the top one-third and one-half from the center one-third.
(6)
Bark texture can denote vigor. Smooth or shiny bark on the trunk and branches of a young tree usually signifies good vigor, conversely, rough and full bark could indicate poor vigor.
(7)
Trunk taper. The trunks of vigorous trees will generally have an increase in diameter with a decrease in height. Trees with reverse tapers or no taper should be avoided.
(8)
Root color. Young roots of most trees will be light in color.
(9)
Trees selected for planting must be free of root defects. Two types of root defects generally occur:
(10)
Kinked roots, in which taproots, major branch roots, or both are bent more than 90 degrees with less than 20 percent of the root system originating above the kink. A tree with such roots will probably bend at the soil line when released from a supporting stake.
(11)
Circling or girdling roots which circle 80 percent or more of the root system by 360 degrees or more. A tree with such roots would ultimately have less than 20 percent of its system available for support.
