DIVISION 2. - REGULATIONS OF NOISE ON PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AND PROPERTY

Sec. 36-178. - Legislative findings and purpose.
(a)
The City of Albany, Georgia, having received an increasing number of complaints from the citizens of the city concerning radio and other noises emanating from vehicles on the public streets and ways and properties of the city, and having made certain observations on the subject, hereby finds and declares that:
(1)
Excessive noise, when unnecessary to the carrying on of religious, political, civic, or commercial activities, or when not generated in the course of other activity necessary to carrying on the daily life, creates a significant threat to the public health, safety and welfare.
(2)
Those noises which are most obnoxious to public health, safety and welfare in the city are those which are loud, boisterous, raucous, unseemly, or which are generated solely for the purpose of entertainment of a person or group of persons without regard to the health, welfare and safety of others who are unable to avoid being subjected to such noises.
(3)
There has been an alarming increase in the frequency and volume of noise from the many portable sound reproducing devices available today, such as portable radios, tape recorders, and cassette players.
(b)
It is, therefore, the intent of this division to strike an appropriate balance between the right of individuals to obtain information and derive pleasure by listening to radios and other devices, and the right of the public to a peaceful and healthful environment. It is not the intent of this legislation to interfere unduly with freedom of speech or religion by regulating the initial production or amplification of sound.

(Ord. No. 10-137, §§ 1, 2, 11-23-2010)
Sec. 36-195. - Procedures for the determination of sound levels.
(a)
Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum and fluctuating rates. All noise measurements shall be made at or within the property line of the impacted site, unless otherwise directed in this division. When instrumentation cannot be placed at or within the property line, the measurement shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. For the purposes of this division, noise measurements are measurements are measured on the A- or C-weighted sound scale, as applicable, of a sound level meter of standard design and quality having characteristics established by ANSI.
(b)
Measurements shall be taken by police or code enforcement officers, or code enforcement inspectors, appropriately trained in the use of a sound level meter.
(c)
The ambient noise levels shall be subtracted from the measured sound levels of the source under investigation by using Table 2 to determine the sound levels from the source of interest alone. If the ambient sound level is less than four dB higher than the background sound level, the source level cannot be derived and a violation of the article cannot be substantiated.
Table 2 Correction for Ambient Noise (in dB)
EXPAND
Difference between ambient and background sound levels Correction factor to be subtracted from ambient level for source level
0 to 3dB Unsustainable Violation
4 to 5dB 2dB
6 to 8dB 1dB
9dB or more 0dB
  (d)
Fixed amplified sound reproduction devices. If the source of sound is an amplified sound reproduction device on private property (e.g., in a residential, industrial or commercial zoned area), and the complainant states that the rhythmic bass component of the music is disturbing, then the sound level measurements may be taken within the dwelling, porch, yard, hotel room, office space, etc., of the complainant. These sound level measurements shall be conducted with the sound level meter set for "C" weighting, "fast" response. Such measurements shall not be taken in areas that receive only casual use, such as hallways, closets and bathrooms. For the purposes of these measurements, the ambient sound level is that sound level which is measured in the building when the sound source under investigation is not prominent, or in a room on the same floor that is relatively unaffected by the sound source under investigation. This "C" scale measurement shall be in addition to the property line measurement described in subparagraph (a) of this section.

Notice of an application for a special variance shall be given by the chief or the chief's representative to persons who frequent the area of the sound or activity and who may be adversely affected by the granting of the variance. Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may file a statement with the city manager or the city manager's representative containing any information to support such individual's claim.
(c)
In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the city manager or the city manager's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the city manager or the city manager's representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the city manager or the city manager's representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance.
(d)
Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this division regulating the source of sound or activity for which the special variance was granted.
(e)
Application for extension of time limits specified in special variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial special variances.
(f)
The city manager or the city manager's designated representative will approve or deny a request for special variance within 30 days of the completed application.

The notice provisions of subsection (h) of this section have been fully and timely performed or completed.
If the evidence presented to the director demonstrates the likelihood that the parking of vehicles or equipment in the front or side yards of residences in the residential area has caused, or is presently causing, a diminution in the value of the residences in such area, degrades the aesthetic appearance of the neighborhood, or tends to damage underground infrastructures leading to the loss of water or other conditions contrary to the public interest, the director shall recommend the application or petition favorably to the city commission.

In the absence of any such finding, the application or petition shall be denied.
(l)
Action by city commission. Upon consideration of the recommendation of director of planning and development services, the city commission shall either:
(1)
Adopt an ordinance extending the application of this section to the requesting residential area; or

Deny such recommendation and request, which action shall be final in all respects.

In the event of a denial of a request under this article by the city commission, no further request shall be filed for the same neighborhood or residential area, or portion thereof, within the six months following the date of such denial; provided, however, if new information is submitted to the director indicating a material change in off-street parking practices within the residential area sufficient to warrant the filing of a new application or petition, the director may waive the six-month limitation.
(o)
The director shall be authorized to promulgate rules and procedures for the efficient administration of this section, including provisions for the issuance of temporary permits that allow, on a limited basis and for a limited period, the parking of vehicles or equipment in areas where such conduct is otherwise prohibited by this section.
