ARTICLE V. - TOW TRUCKS

Sec. 50-103. - Wrecker services.
(a)
Officer on scene of accident. Whenever, as a result of any motor vehicle accident or collision on a street or road within the limits of the city, there exists a need for the services of a wrecker or tow truck, the officer on the scene of the accident or collision shall inquire of the person needing the services of the wrecker or tow truck as to whether the person desires to call a specific wrecker service or tow truck operator. In the event the person requests that a specific wrecker service or tow truck operator be called, the officer shall comply with the request, subject to a determination by the officer as to whether the requested wrecker service can perform the needed services in a timely fashion. The determination of the ability of the wrecker service shall be within the discretion of the officer on the scene and based upon the following factors: distance requested wrecker service will have to travel and the time involved; the degree traffic is disrupted or the traffic hazard created and the length of time the officer will need to remain on the scene to supervise the removal. The officer shall document in his report the factors considered in rejecting the person's request and ask the person need[ing] the wrecker services to choose another. The same determination shall again be made by the officer on the scene in regarding to the ability of the requested wrecker service to perform the needed services in a timely fashion. If the second request is reject[ed], the office[r] shall deem that the person needing the services has failed to designate a wrecker service for the removal of his/her property. In all cases whereby the owner or operator of a motor vehicle fails to designate a wrecker service for the removal of his/her motor vehicle for whatever reason, inside the city limits, the city shall contact only those wrecker services which have been approved under this section to be placed on the city wrecker rotational list and have made application to be placed on the rotating list for service calls by the city.
(b)
Wrecker services placed on a rotational basis for service calls. The chief of police shall establish two rotation lists. The first list shall be for light duty operators and shall consist of those having been approved for light duty service. The second list shall consist of only those wrecker services having been approved for heavy duty service. The rotational list shall be approved and certified by signature of the chief of police. Each wrecker service approved shall be placed on its respective list for as long as they can demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section and shall be used by the city for a period of two weeks. The start of the rotation will begin at 12:01 a.m. on Monday and will run continuously for a period of two weeks. At the end of this period, this wrecker service shall be placed at the bottom of the list and each list shall be rotated in like manner every two weeks. The chief of police shall have responsibility for the maintenance of records that ensure that wrecker services placed on the list are in compliance with the requirements of this section. Any new wrecker service shall be placed at the bottom of the list for which it is approved. Within 30 days after a new company is placed on the rotation list a revised copy of the rotation list will be delivered by personal service or by certified mail to all wrecker services currently on the rotation list. The chief of police shall have responsibility for conducting a meeting with all wrecker services on the rotation lists a minimum of annually.
