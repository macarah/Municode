In recommending a variance, the board may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to the location, construction, maintenance and operation of any use or building, in addition to those expressly set forth in this ordinance, as may be deemed necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. Decisions of the planning commission may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals. Any applicant aggrieved by a decision of the board of zoning appeals may pursue appeals to the courts of proper jurisdiction of the State of Georgia as provided by law.

a.
There are unusual, exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property that do not apply generally to other property in the same vicinity or use district, and such conditions are not the result of the owner's or occupant's own actions. Such conditions may include topography, unique natural conditions, surroundings of the subject property, or the size or peculiar shape of the lot.
b.
As a result of such unusual circumstance or conditions, there is an undue hardship or practical difficulty that renders it difficult to carry out the provisions of this Code.
c.
The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or district in which property is located, and the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the provisions of this Code. The variance approved is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
d.
The variance does not permit a use of land, building or structure that is not permitted by right in the land use intensity district in which the variance is requested.
(j)
Staff investigation and report. The zoning administrator shall make an investigation of all variance applications and shall prepare a report, considering applicable criteria. The investigation shall be submitted to the planning commission. The investigation shall also be made available to the applicant prior to any public hearing scheduled on the matter.

Conditions shall be in writing and the purpose for the conditions shall be established.

Conditions placed on property at the time of rezoning shall become a written part of the minutes of the county commission meeting and shall be attached to the amendment to the official zoning map. The conditions imposed shall be part of the rezoning application and kept in the office of the zoning administrator. Conditions on the property travel with the property and stay in effect when property changes owners.
