(5)
Those which have visible soil erosion adjacent to or under any structural support;

Sec. 5-35. - Prohibitions; repair or demolition; assessment of costs.
(a)
Unsafe buildings as herein defined are declared to be public nuisances.
(b)
The procedure for the abatement of nuisances shall be as follows:
(1)
The board of commissioners of the county shall choose a person to be charged with the enforcement of this code section, to be known as the unsafe building enforcement officer.
(2)
Whenever the unsafe building enforcement officer is advised that any building or structure is unsafe or whenever it appears to the unsafe building enforcement officer that a building or structure is unsafe, he shall proceed to investigate and determine whether, on the basis of the facts disclosed, he finds that the building is in fact unsafe.
(3)
If the unsafe building enforcement officer finds that the building is unsafe, he shall thereupon notify the owner thereof of his determination and his reasons for finding that the building is unsafe, and shall allow the owner thirty (30) days in which to repair the building so as to render it safe, or to demolish the same.
(4)
The notice to be given to the owner shall be in writing and shall be sent to the owner by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, the notice being addressed to the address of the owner as reflected upon the tax records of the county. If the name or whereabouts, either or both, of the owner are unknown, the unsafe building enforcement officer shall cause a notice to be posted upon the premises for a period of thirty (30) days.
(5)
If, after thirty (30) days from receipt of the notice (refusal to accept delivery being tantamount to receipt) or from the first day of posting the notice, as the case may be, the owner of the property shall fail or refuse to demolish the building or begin in good faith to make repairs thereon, the owner shall be deemed to be in violation hereof.
(6)
If the owner is deemed to be in violation of the provisions hereof, so that he is deemed to be guilty of an offense, the unsafe building enforcement officer shall issue or cause to be issued a summons returnable to the magistrate court of the county.
(7)
If the magistrate court of the county, on the basis of a hearing, determines that the building is unsafe and is a public nuisance, the court shall issue an order which shall be served by the unsafe building enforcement officer upon the owner if a resident of the county, requiring the owner, within a reasonable time specified therein not exceeding sixty (60) days, to repair, alter or improve the structure so as to render it safe or to demolish it. If the owner shall be a nonresident of the county, or if the name or address, either or both, are unknown, a copy of the order of the court shall be posted upon the unsafe building.
(8)
Additionally, if the owner shall fail to repair or demolish the unsafe building at any time after having been ordered to do so by the magistrate court of the county, the county is authorized to cause such unsafe building to be demolished. Upon completion of demolition, the county shall advise the owner by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, if his name and address is shown upon the tax records of the county or otherwise known, the cost of such demolition and the owner shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice within which to pay the cost. If the name of the owner or his address, either or both, are unknown, the county shall cause a like notice to be posted upon the property, and the owner shall have thirty (30) days from the date of posting in which to pay the costs of demolition. If the owner shall fail to pay the costs within the time allowed, the county shall notify the tax commissioner of the county, who shall thereupon issue an execution for the costs of demolition plus the costs of recording the execution, which execution shall be recorded in the general execution docket of the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county. Executions shall bear such interest, have such priority and lien, and shall be enforceable in all respects as are executions issued for ad valorem taxes due the county.

In all such cases no permit fees shall be refunded.
(2)
Violation of code provisions. The chief building official may revoke a permit upon determination by the chief building official that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of the construction codes. The chief building official shall specify the changes or corrections necessary to be made to conform to the construction codes. If necessary changes or corrections have not been made after a reasonable time period (but not greater than thirty (30) days) as determined by the chief building official, the chief building official shall then revoke the permit.

Discontinuance of services for violations. The chief building official may request from the appropriate department head (or applicable utility company) to withhold services, such as water, garbage collection, sewer services or any other service of similar nature rendered by the City of Forsyth or the county, from any property on which any structure, house or building is being erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of the National Electrical Code, Standard Building Code, Standard Plumbing Code, Standard Mechanical Code, Standard Gas Code, or in violation of any other law or ordinance of the City of Forsyth or the county pertaining to health, safety or welfare. The chief building official shall notify the person in charge of or in possession of such property, or the owner thereof, of the violations and shall fix a reasonable time for the correction of such violations.

The chief building official may also request, in writing, all public utility corporations to discontinue or refuse services to such property maintained in violation of the City of Forsyth or the county laws or ordinances, and such public utility corporations, after the time fixed by the chief building official, shall not render any services to such property.
(4)
Reinstatement of permit. If a permit issued under the provisions of these codes has been revoked due to misrepresentation of the application or violation of the code provisions, the owner, authorized agent or contractor must submit a new application for a building permit and pay all applicable fees.
(e)
Requirements not covered by code. Any requirements necessary for the strength, stability or proper operation of an existing or proposed building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not specifically covered by the construction codes, shall be determined by the chief building official. If an applicant disagrees with the decision of the chief building official, the applicant shall have the privilege of appeal as defined in subsection 5-56(d).
(f)
Alternate materials and methods. The provisions of the construction codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by them, provided any such alternate has been reviewed by the chief building official. The chief building official shall approve any such alternate, provided the chief building official finds that the alternate for the purpose intended is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the construction codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. The chief building official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claim made regarding the alternate.
