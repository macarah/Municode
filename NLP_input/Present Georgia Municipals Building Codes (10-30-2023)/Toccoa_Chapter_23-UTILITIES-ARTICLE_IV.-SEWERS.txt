The objectives of this article are:
(a)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with the operation of the POTW;
(b)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
(c)
To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations;
(d)
To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
(e)
To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the POTW;
(f)
To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and
(g)
To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other Federal or State laws to which the POTW is subject.
This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. The chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires industrial user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. All industrial users of the POTW shall comply with all provisions of this chapter and all other POTW shall comply with all provisions of this chapter and all other applicable ordinances, laws and regulations.

The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 23-215(3) of this chapter.
(2)
The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 23-215(g) of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 23-216(d) of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(3)
For purposes of this requirement significant changes include, but are not limited to flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(f)
Reports of potential problems.
(1)
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the use shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(2)
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
(3)
Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
(4)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
(i)
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 23-217(e) of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections 23-217(a), (c) and (e) of this chapter.
(2)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(5)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
(j)
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA and the city.
(k)
Sample collection.
(1)
Except as indicated in subsection (2) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic pounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(l)
Determination of noncompliance. The director may use a grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
(m)
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(n)
Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director.
(Ord. No. 98-005, 5-11-98)
Sec. 23-218. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
(a)
Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3)
Any other discharge violation that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public);
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8)
Any other violation(s) which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(b)
Notification of violation. When the director finds that any user has violated or is violating any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the director or his agent may serve upon said user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(c)
Consent orders. The director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (e) and (f) below and shall be judicially enforceable.
(d)
Show cause hearing. The director may order any user which causes or contributes to violation(s) of any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(e)
Compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within ten days. If the user does not come into compliance within ten days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and property operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(f)
Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has or is violating any provision of this chapter, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: Immediately comply with all requirements; and take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(g)
Administrative fines.
(1)
When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $50,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2)
Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(3)
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(4)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(h)
Emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection and/or discontinuance of water service, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in subsection (i) are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the director, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (d) and (i) of this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(i)
Termination of discharge. In addition to those provisions in section 23-216(f) of this chapter, any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(A)
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(B)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(C)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
(D)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
(E)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections 23-121 and 23-122 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 23-218(d) of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 98-005, 5-11-98)
Sec. 23-219. - Judicial enforcement remedies.
(a)
Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the director may petition the Municipal Court of Stephens County Court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking remediation.
(b)
Civil penalties.
(1)
A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, any order or wastewater discharge permit hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of up to at least $1,000.00 per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(2)
The director may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
(3)
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(4)
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(c)
Criminal prosecution.
(1)
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than six months or both.
(2)
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of up to $1,000.00 and/or be subject to imprisonment for six months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
(3)
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of up to $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.
(4)
In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of up to $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.
(d)
Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The director may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
(Ord. No. 98-005, 5-11-98)
Sec. 23-220. - Supplemental enforcement action.
(a)
Performance bonds. The director may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, any orders, or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(b)
Liability insurance. The director may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has filed to comply with any provision of this chapter, any order, or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the director caused by its discharge.
(c)
Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, orders, or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(d)
Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director or his designee. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance.
(e)
Informant rewards. The director may pay up to $1,000.00 for information leading to the discovery of noncompliance by a user. In the event that the information provided results in an administrative fine or civil penalty levied against the user, the director may disperse up to five percent of the collected fine or penalty to the informant. However, a single reward payment may not exceed $5,000.00.
(f)
Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved consistent compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the city. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the city held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards may be terminated at the discretion of the director.
Sec. 23-221. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Upset.
(1)
For the purpose of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical state and local pretreatment standards and requirements and/or permit conditions because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical, local and/or state pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
(i)
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(ii)
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
(iii)
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical, local and/or state pretreatment standards.
(6)
The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical, local and/or state pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(b)
General/specific prohibitions. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 23-121 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: (a) a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference, or (b) no local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(c)
Bypass.
(1)
a.
"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
b.
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
a.
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements or permit conditions to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. Those bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the director within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
a.
Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(i)
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
(ii)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(iii)
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the conditions listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
b.
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)a. of this section.
(Ord. No. 98-005, 5-11-98)
Sec. 23-222. - Severability.
If any provision of this chapter is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be effected and shall continue in full force and effect.
(Ord. No. 98-005, 5-11-98)
Sec. 23-223. - Conflicts.
All other ordinances and parts of other ordinances inconsistent or conflicting with any part of this chapter, are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict.
