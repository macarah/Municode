An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid.
E.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any future change in demand for public facilities created by a development project in excess of the demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due.
