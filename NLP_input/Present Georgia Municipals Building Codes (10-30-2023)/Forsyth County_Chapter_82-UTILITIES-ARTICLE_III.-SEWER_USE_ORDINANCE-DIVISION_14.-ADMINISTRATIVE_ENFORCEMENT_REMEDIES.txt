DIVISION 14. - ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES

Sec. 82-106. - Notification of violation.
When the director finds that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon such user or person a written notice of violation. Within seven days of the receipt of this notice, such user or person shall submit to the director (i) an explanation of the violation; (ii) a plan for satisfactory corrective action with regard to such violation; and (iii) a plan for prevention of recurrence of such violation. Submission of this plan in no way relieves such user or person of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in the section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-107. - Consent orders.
The director is hereby authorized to enter into consent agreements, consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user or person responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user or person to correct the noncompliance with a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 82-109 and 82-110 of this article and shall be enforceable in a court of law.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-108. - Show cause hearing.
The director may order any user or person which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on such user or person specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that such user or person show cause why the proposed enforcement should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of such user or person. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking other action against such user or person.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-109. - Compliance orders.
When the director determines that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to such user or person responsible for the discharge directing that such user or person come into compliance within a specified time. If such user or person does not come into compliance within the time provided, the director may discontinue sewer service. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve any user or person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, the director taking any other action against such user or person.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110. - Cease and desist order.
(a)
When the director determines that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the past violations of such user or person are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to such user or person directing it to cease and desist all such violations and to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all applicable requirements; and
(2)
Take such appropriate corrective, remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address any violation (including without limitation, any continuing or threatened violation), including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(b)
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for taking any other action against such user or person.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.1. - Administrative fines.
(a)
When the county finds that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the county may fine such user or person in an amount no less than $250.00 but not to exceed $1,000.00, per violation, and in the case of an industrial user, $1,000.00, per violation, per day. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(b)
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 15 days be assessed an additional penalty of 12 percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of the greater of two percent per month or the rate specified for interest on investments of the EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund established by 26 U.S.C. § 9507 (and set forth at: http://www.epa.gov/ocfo/finstatement/superfund/int_rate.htm). A lien against the property of such user or person will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(c)
The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(d)
To the extent permitted by state statute, issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against such user or person.
(e)
To the extent violators are not "industrial users" as contemplated by O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(b), administrative penalty fines shall be limited to $1,000.00 per violation.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.2. - Emergency suspensions.
(a)
The director may immediately suspend the discharge of any user or person, after informal notice to such user or person, whenever such suspension appears necessary, in the opinion of the director, to abate an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, cause, or contribute to an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health and safety or the environment. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user or person notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a failure by such user or person to immediately comply with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize harm or threatened harm or endangerment to the POTW, its receiving stream, or to human health and safety or the environment. The county may allow such user or person to recommence its discharge when such user or person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 82-110.3 are initiated against such user or person.
(2)
Any user or person responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrences, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 82-108 and 82-110.3 of this article.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.3. - Termination of discharge and/or potable water supply.
Any user or person who violates any of the following conditions is subject to termination of discharge and/or potable water supply:
(1)
Violation of an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the premises of such user or person for lawful purposes, including without limitation, inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 5 of this article;
(6)
Discharges wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause an imbalance in the wastewater treatment process;
(7)
Fails to pay monthly bills for sanitary sewer service when due;
(8)
Repeats a discharge of prohibited wastes into public sewers;
(9)
Acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment process are released into the public sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures or interfering with proper conveyance and treatment of wastewater; or
(10)
A governmental agency informs Forsyth County that the effluent from the county's wastewater treatment plant is no longer of a quality permitted for discharge into a watercourse, and it is found that the customer, user or person is discharging such wastewater effluent into the public sewer in a manner that cannot be sufficiently treated or requires treatment that is not provided by Forsyth County as normal domestic treatment.
Such user or person will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and/or potable water supply and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 82-108 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against such user or person.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.4. - Recovery of costs incurred.
In addition to civil and criminal liability, any user or person violating any permit provision or any provision of the Forsyth County Sewer Use Ordinance, or causing damage to or otherwise inhibiting the county's wastewater disposal system, shall be liable to the county for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. Forsyth County shall bill such user or person for the costs incurred by the county for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed cost shall constitute a separate violation of section 82-110.1(b) of this article. All costs of any additional or supplemental sampling or analyses required as a result of any excessive pollutant loadings (such as BOD 5 , suspended solids, floating oil and grease, heavy metals, or priority pollutants) of any user or person, as determined by the director, or otherwise resulting from any suspected or actual permit violation of any user or person shall be paid for by such user or person.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.5. - Appeal of certain actions of the director.
(a)
Any user or person aggrieved by any order or action of the director made pursuant to sections 82-109 through 82-110.3 of this article, may appeal the decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the director within seven days of the issuance of such decision. A notice of appeal shall state the specific reason why the order or action of the director is alleged to be in error.
(b)
If the director does not reverse his or her decision within 30 days of receiving a timely written notice of appeal, then such user or person may within seven days, appeal to the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners (the "board"). The hearing shall be held within the next two meetings of the board or a date mutually agreed upon in writing by the appellant and the chair of the board. The board shall then make its findings within 30 days of the appeal hearing. The appellant shall not be relieved of his obligations during the appeal process.
(c)
If the appellant is dissatisfied with the board's decision, the appellant may then appeal the decision to the county superior court.
