Chapter 15.38 - TREE CONSERVATION AND REPLACEMENT
Sections:

15.38.010 - Short title—Purpose and intent.
The short title of this chapter is the "City of Locust Grove Tree Conservation and Replacement Ordinance." The city deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety and welfare to enact an ordinance for the conservation, planting and replacement of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees in the city without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of real property. The importance of trees is recognized for their shade, cooling, noise and wind reduction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust filtration, carbon dioxide absorption, aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real property, and their contribution to the general well being and quality of life of the citizens of Locust Grove. Consistent with the expressed purpose of this chapter, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees as defined herein. It is also the intent of this chapter that all applicable sites within the city maintain or obtain a minimum tree density, as defined and explained herein.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
15.38.020 - Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning prescribed, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. All other terms shall be accorded their common meaning.

"Board of appeals" means the Locust Grove city council.
"Buffer" means an area required to remain undisturbed pursuant to the subdivision regulations, the zoning ordinance, a condition of zoning or this chapter.
"Building department" means Henry County building department.
"Caliper" means a standard of trunk measurement for understory or replacement trees. Caliper inches are measured at the height of six inches above the ground for trees up to and including four inch caliper and twelve inches above the ground for trees larger than four inch caliper.
"City" means the city of Locust Grove, Georgia or its designee.
"City arborist" means the person or his or her designee who shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Until a city arborist has been chosen by the city council or when the position becomes vacant, the city arborist shall be the city manager.
"Conifer tree" means any tree with needle leaves and a woody cone fruit including, but not limited to, pine, juniper and cedar species.
"Construction area" means that area outside the tree save area that is used for any of the following purposes: (a) public or private rights-of-way; (b) driveways, not to exceed twenty feet in width; (c) utility easements, not to exceed ten feet in width unless otherwise required by law or the utility provider; (d) sewer and stormwater easements not to exceed forty feet in width; (e) parking facilities; (e) lot building areas.
"Critical root zone" means the minimum area beneath a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The critical root zone (CRZ) will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to one and three-tenths times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. Example: The CRZ radius of a twenty-inch diameter tree is twenty-six feet.
"Density factor" means a unit of measurement used to prescribe the calculated tree coverage on a site.
"Developer" means the person, persons, or entity making application for land disturbance permits, building permits, or certificates of occupancy for any development activity.
"Development activity" means any alteration of the natural environment which requires the approval of a development or site plan and issuance of a land disturbance permit. By way of illustration but not limitation, development activity shall also include the "thinning" or removal of trees from land in conjunction with a forest management program, the removal or destruction of trees incidental to the development of land or to the marketing of land for development, the removal or destruction of trees in conjunction with any grading activity, including the removal or filling (stockpiling) of soil, and logging or the removal of trees not in conjunction with an ongoing forest management program. Nothing in this definition shall be deemed to require or authorize the issuance of a permit for any activity described herein.
"Development plan review department" means the Henry County development plan review department.
"Diameter breast-height (DBH)" means the standard measure of tree size for trees existing on a site. The diameter of the tree trunk is measured at a height of four and one-half feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, measure the trunk at its most narrow point beneath the split.
"Grading activity" means altering ground surfaces to specified elevations, dimensions, and/or slopes; this includes stripping, cutting, filling, stockpiling and shaping or any combination thereof and shall include the land in its cut or filled condition.

"Lot building area" means that area of a lot, set aside for construction of the primary structure, not including the front, side and rear setbacks, as established by the city zoning ordinance. The lot building area may be expanded into said setbacks by no more than ten feet from the foundation of a structure where such foundation is located on or within five feet of the setback line so as to minimize construction impacts on the tree save area, unless a variance has been granted for any such setback.
"Non-development activity" means any alteration of the natural environment, which does not require development or site plan approval, but which would include the proposed removal or destruction of any tree(s). Any removal of trees that constitutes development activity as that term is herein defined shall not constitute non-development activity.
"Overstory tree" means trees that compose the top layer or canopy of vegetation and will generally reach a mature height of greater than forty feet.

15.38.070 - General requirements for active development.
A.
Prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit for the applicable development, or phase of development the following general steps shall be satisfied.
1.
Developer shall prepare an integrated site plan and tree survey as prescribed under Section 15.38.080.
2.
Developer shall submit the integrated site plan and tree survey to the city arborist who will determine which specimen trees will be preserved. This determination should be made after consultation with developer. All specimen trees not preserved shall be replaced in accordance with Section 15.38.090(D). Developer shall also submit to the city arborist the administration fee required under Section 15.38.140 and an aerial photograph of the entire area upon which development activities are to take place. (Such photographs may be obtained from Henry County administration.)
3.
Developer shall mark all specimen trees to be preserved with a ring of blue colored water-based paint around the base of their trunks. Developer shall cordon off all tree save areas from construction areas with heavy millimeter plastic tape, a minimum of four inches wide with dark letters on a bright background reading "Tree Save Area Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint. Such signage shall be installed no less than three feet and no more than five feet from the ground and shall remain in functioning condition until the construction proximate to the tree save area is complete. Thereafter, developer shall remove and dispose of said signage.
4.
Unless preexisting, developer shall plant and maintain a dense vegetative buffer along the perimeter of the development or phase of the development in which grading activity may occur. The width of said buffer shall be at least as wide as that required under the city zoning ordinance. In addition, the area in which grading activity may occur shall be visually screened from public roads by at least a fifty foot buffer. Planting of said buffer shall begin no later than thirty days after tree removal or grading activities have begun and shall be complete no later than ninety days thereafter.
5.
City arborist shall inspect the development site for compliance with the above requirements. Where tree trunks or critical root zones are in jeopardy of being damaged by equipment, the city arborist shall require the developer to provide meaningful protection of such aspects of trees, such as strap two-inch by four-inch boards around tree trunks or erect a fence around the critical root zone. Such tree protection shall remain in functioning condition until the certificate of occupancy is issued.
6.
After lawfully receiving a land disturbance permit, developer may undertake tree removal and grading activities within the construction area only. No grading activity shall be permitted in tree save areas.
B.
Prior to the issuance of any building permit for the applicable development or phase of development, the following general steps shall be satisfied.
1.
City arborist shall inspect to determine whether developer has impermissibly disturbed the tree save areas.
2.
If developer wishes to count trees in tree save areas towards satisfaction of the minimum tree density requirement under Section 15.38.090, landscaping requirements under Chapter 15.42 of this title, or remove trees under twelve inches DBH in the tree save area, then developer shall submit a tree survey, as prescribed under Section 15.38.080(C), to the city arborist of those trees in the tree save area developer wishes to count towards either or both of the mentioned provisions and those non-pine species in the tree save area twelve inches DBH or greater. Said survey shall be prepared, certified, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect. Developer shall mark those surveyed trees in the tree save area with a ring of blue colored water-based paint around the base of their trunks. To satisfy the landscaping requirements under said chapter, the marked trees in the tree save area and preserved specimen trees shall be located on the same lot which is subject to said landscaping requirements.
3.
After submission of the tree save area tree survey and prior to tree removal in a tree save area, city arborist shall inspect the tree save areas for proper marking consistent with the tree save area tree survey.
4.
If after inspection the city arborist determines that deve1oper has complied with the above requirements, the developer may remove any trees in the tree save area under twelve inches DBH that are not to be counted toward compliance with the minimum tree density requirement under Section 15.38.090 or landscaping requirements under Chapter 15.42 of this title. Also, the city arborist shall sign-off on developer's building permit for the applicable lot or area of the development.
C.
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any lot the applicable development or phase of development, the following general steps shall be satisfied.
1.
Developer shall plant those trees necessary to comply with the minimum tree density requirements under Section 15.38.090 and the landscaping requirements under Chapter 15.42 of this title.
2.
Developer shall submit to the city arborist a plat of the lot indicating the location of any replacement trees and a document certifying that the particular lot in question contains the minimum tree density required under Section 15.38.090 and satisfies the landscaping requirements under Chapter 15.42 of this title, both items signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect. Prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy above eighty percent of those needed to complete the development or phase of development, developer shall submit to the city arborist a document prepared, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect certifying that those portions or lots of the development or phase of development which will not need certificates of occupancy contain the minimum tree density required under Section 15.38.090 and satisfy the landscaping requirements under Chapter 15.42 of this title. Such certifications shall contain calculations showing compliance with the required site density factor using existing trees, replacement trees, and/or contributions to the city of Locust Grove tree replacement fund. (See density factor analysis, Appendix B.)
3.
City arborist shall inspect tree plantings and review the assertions of the developer's registered landscape architect. If the city arborist determines compliance with of the above requirements, city arborist shall sign-off on developer's certificate of occupancy for the applicable lot or area of development.
D.
Following any inspection, the city arborist shall advise the applicant of any recommended changes in the applicant's proposed tree removal, protection or planting plans necessary to make the plans comply with the provisions of this chapter.
E.
The city arborist shall review all requests and supporting data and take one of the following actions: approve, approve with conditions or disapprove. Requests, which meet the requirements of this chapter, shall be approved.
F.
In no case shall a land disturbance permit, building permit, or certificate of occupancy be issued for a property upon which timber harvesting has occurred, with or without a permit, where such timber harvesting was completed within the last eighteen months.
G.
Except as provided in Section 15.38.100 of this chapter authorizing certain limited cut and fill activities, the city arborist may refuse to sign-off on any tree removal or land disturbance permit until the submission of all development plans and receipt of other evidence satisfactory to the city arborist that there is a reasonable certainty that the development activity is imminent.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
15.38.080 - Integrated site plan and tree survey submission requirements.
A.
When a person applies for a land disturbance permit for active development, such person shall pay the administration fee as required under Section 15.38.140 to the city and file an integrated site plan and tree survey with the city arborist providing the following information:
1.
The species, location, health, size (DBH) and density unit value for specimen trees;
2.
Site area, including location of existing and proposed utility property or easements, boring sites for underground utilities, and all structures, driveways and curb cuts and detention ponds;
3.
A delineation of all tree save areas and construction areas;
4.
All buffers required under the city zoning ordinance shall be delineated;
5.
Property lines and phase lines if any for the development;
6.
Water bodies and topographical lines sufficient to show elevation and drainage of land;
7.
If applicable, details concerning any tree protection devices or measures (such as fencing, tree wells, aeration systems, permeable paving, retaining walls, bollards, etc.);
8.
The integrated site plan and tree survey shall be certified, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect; and
9.
Any additional information as required by the city arborist as he or she deems necessary on a case-by-case basis.
B.
Minor additions to existing development require only a sketch showing changes to be submitted to the city arborist for review and approval.
C.
The tree survey for tree save areas, as may be required in Section 15.38.070(B)(2), shall also be integrated into the site plan for a particular lot certified, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect noting the species, location, health, size (DBH) and density unit value of all trees within the tree save area as deep as is necessary to meet the minimum density requirements under Section 15.38.090 or landscaping requirements under Chapter 15.42 of this title or to determine those trees to be preserved from tree removal.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
15.38.090 - Minimum tree density requirements.
A.
All sites within the city, other than single-family residential lots, shall maintain a minimum tree density of twenty units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area as defined herein and is not synonymous with "tree." Minimum tree density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in Appendix B to this chapter. The developer shall be subject to the minimum tree density requirement set forth in this section, but the developer shall base its density calculations on the net site area excluding construction areas, except parking areas. For the purposes of this section, parking areas shall not be considered part of the construction area.
B.
All newly constructed single-family residential lots in the city shall maintain a minimum tree density based upon the maximum number of trees that can be maintained within thirty percent of the lot's plantable area, taking into consideration the standards for tree size and separation — overstory trees, two hundred square feet and understory trees, seventy-five square feet.
C.
The minimum tree density requirement shall be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density requirement may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this chapter or some combination of the two. In addition, planting on such lots shall be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree (minimum two-inch caliper) for every three understory trees (minimum one-inch caliper). No more than thirty percent of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan.
D.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. (Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, water detention location and the like.) Developers shall receive a density credit of two times the assigned unit value for each specimen tree saved by utilizing an alternate design. Specimen trees that cannot be saved shall be replaced with trees having a total density equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper. Specimen trees removed without prior approval shall be replaced with trees equal to eight times the unit value with a minimum four-inch tree caliper and subject to the applicable penalties as described in Section 15.38.170.
E.
The intent of this chapter is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide some alternatives in such cases, two alternative methods of compliance may, at the discretion of the city council, be approved: planting at a location remote from the project site; or, contributing to the city of Locust Grove tree replacement fund.
1.
The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods. The city arborist shall review requests for alternative compliance and recommend to the city council whether to approve or disapprove the request. In no instance will more than eighty percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive shall be planted on the site in question.
2.
No certificate of occupancy for a development or phase of development shall be issued until the city arborist has received the necessary documentation and/or funds and the city council has approved the request. If trees are to be planted at another location, a plan indicating location, caliper, number and species of trees to be planted as well as schedule for completion of planting shall be submitted to the city arborist for review and recommendation. The off-site location should be in the same area of the city as the project site
3.
If the city council chooses to accept a donation to the city of Locust Grove tree replacement fund, the city arborist shall establish the amount of the donation. The amount of the donation shall be based upon the number, size and species of trees that cannot be planted at the site. The city arborist shall estimate the cost to the city for the materials, labor and three-year maintenance requirements associated with the trees. The amount of the donation shall be one hundred percent of the estimated costs of the average of two bids from reputable landscape contractors for the materials, labor and maintenance. The city shall use the funds for the purpose of planting trees on public property, which is preferred, for tree conservation education, landscaping public property or soil erosion minimization projects.
F.
Documentation of compliance with this section, including tree density calculations described in Appendix B, shall be prepared, certified, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
15.38.100 - Land disturbance permit for non-active developments.
A.
Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no tree removal shall be allowed or approved for any site not under active development. For the purposes of this chapter, a site is not under active development unless there exists an approved development plan delineating the improvements to be constructed on the site consistent with the use for which the site is zoned, and there is a reasonable certainty that construction is imminent.
B.
A land disturbance permit may be issued for grading activity on a site not under active development provided that all of the following requirements have been met.
1.
The sole purpose of the grading activity is for the storage, removal or altering of soil for fill balancing on another site under active development.
2.
The proposed grading activity shall not decrease the tree density below the minimum tree density for the site as calculated under Section 15.38.090(A). For the purposes of this section, trees in buffers that will be required shall be excluded from minimum density calculations.
3.
The area to be disturbed within the site shall be the area that will have the least adverse impact on existing trees, as determined by the city arborist. In addition, the area shall be visually screened from public roads and all adjacent properties by a one hundred foot dense vegetative buffer along the perimeter of the property on which there will be land disturbance. In order to provide reasonable visual screening, it may be necessary to locate access roads to the impacted area in a winding manner to prevent a straight line of site to the impacted area. Planting of said buffer shall begin no later than thirty days after tree removal or grading activities have begun and shall be complete no later than ninety days thereafter.
4.
The disturbed area within the site shall be replanted with trees to a tree density of twenty units per acre no later than eighteen months from the issuance of the land disturbance permit authorizing the grading activities. A tree replacement plan and a bond shall be submitted and approved by the city arborist prior to the issuance of the permit authorizing the grading activities. The bond shall be in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the estimated cost of the materials, labor and maintenance associated with the replanting. The bond shall be held for one year and to the end of the succeeding planting season to ensure survival of the replacement trees. The applicant shall be responsible for the irrigation (watering) of trees during the period of the bond. The replanting requirements of this section shall not apply and the bond shall be released, if, on or before fifteen months from the issuance of the permit authorizing the grading activity, the site becomes under active development pursuant to the issuance of a land disturbance permit and the approval of development plans in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
C.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize any grading activity or similar activity not otherwise in compliance with the city subdivision ordinance including the city soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance. Further, nothing in this section shall be deemed to eliminate the requirement that all reasonable efforts shall be taken to save and to not adversely impact the critical root zones of specimen trees and that all applicable sites from the city shall maintain or obtain the minimum tree density required by this chapter.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
15.38.110 - Tree damage.
Any tree designated in the plan to be saved that is damaged during construction or as a result of such construction shall be treated according to accepted National Arborist Association Standards or replaced with a tree(s) equal to the unit value of the tree damaged beyond treatment. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with a tree(s) eight times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper. In the event that a damaged specimen tree shall be removed, the location occupied by the tree's critical root zone shall remain in a pervious state with no structures or buildings placed in this area and violations shall be subject to the applicable penalties as described in Section 15.38.170.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
15.38.120 - Tree planting standards.
A.
Unless otherwise documented, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect or approved by the city arborist, trees selected for planting shall be on the tree planting list. (See Appendix A.) Trees selected for planting shall be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and shall be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual" or similar publication. Reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60, 1973) for plant material quality specifications. Reference the "Manual of Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books, or later editions) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements.
B.
It is desirable that planted trees be ecologically compatible with the site and neighboring sites. Accordingly, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed when practical.
C.
All planted overstory trees shall be at least six feet tall and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. All replanted understory trees shall be at least four feet tall or have a trunk not less than one caliper inch. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the following minimum criteria shall be observed unless otherwise approved by the city arborist:
Overstory trees - two hundred square feet of pervious root zone.
Understory trees - seventy-five square feet of pervious root zone
(However, up to thirty percent of critical root zone may be impervious area)
D.
Planted trees shall be placed in areas so as to maximize their benefits, such as shade for single-family residential structures, streets or parking lots; augment the minimum depth of buffers around commercial or industrial activities; or soil erosion prevention on slopes.
E.
At developer's discretion, planted trees under this section may be applied to the minimum landscaping requirements under Chapter 15.42 of this title to the extent such planted trees are located on a lot or area subject to said landscaping requirements.
F.
Compliance with this section shall be documented, signed and sealed by a registered landscape architect.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
15.38.130 - Tree removal compliance inspection.
A.
Following the issuance of a land disturbance permit for the development site, the city arborist shall from time to time inspect the site for the purpose of certifying compliance with the requirements of the chapter. In the event of noncompliance, the city arborist, may revoke or modify any city permit pertaining to the development activity for which the land disturbance permit has been issued. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until actual compliance is obtained.
B.
If any required land disturbance permit conditions have not been met within the time specified in the land disturbance permit, and provided the city arborist has not granted a written extension, the city may use the cash or bond proceeds to insure that these conditions are met. The bond will have an expiration date no longer than one year, and the proceeds will go to the city of Locust Grove tree replacement fund under Section 15.38.090(E).
C.
After development is complete, the city arborist shall continue to make random inspections to insure that required trees are maintained.

APPENDIX B
TREE DENSITY CALCULATION
A basic requirement of the Tree Conservation and Replacement Ordinance is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of twenty units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of the Basel area (a standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with "tree."
This density requirement shall be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula:
SDF - EDF = RDF
where:
SDF (Site Density Factor) — the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (units per acre).
EDF (Existing Density Factor) — Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
RDF (Replacement Density Factor) — Density of new trees to be planted on a site.
The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of acres by the minimum tree density requirements.
EXAMPLE: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 × 20 = 44
The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units. Table A below does this.
EXAMPLE: A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site. The tree inventory is as follows:
7 — 12 inch diameter pines
3 — 14 inch diameter pines
3 — 18 inch diameter pines
1 — 21 inch diameter hickory
1 — 30 inch diameter oak
Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined as follows:
EXPAND
DBH DENSITY
UNIT VALUE NO. OF TREES SUBTOTALS
12 inch 0.8 X 7 5.6
14 inch 1.2 X 3 3.6
18 inch 1.8 X 3 5.4
21 inch 2.6 X 1 2.6
30 inch 4.4 X 1 4.4
Total EDF 21.6
  The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
EXAMPLE: RDF = 44 - 21.6 = 22.4
In this example, the site would require replacement trees of 22.4 density credits.
The density credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in TABLE B. Following TABLE B are tree replacement requirements.

5.
No more than twenty percent of all trees planted for replacement density credit may be under two-inch caliper.
(Ord. 04-01-001 § 2 (part))
APPENDIX C
SPECIMEN TREES
A.
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for conservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees.
B.
The following criteria are used by the city arborist to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria shall be met for a tree to qualify.
1.
Size Criteria.
a.
Trees, exclusive of conifer trees: twenty-four-inch diameter or larger.
2.
Condition Criteria.
a.
Greater than fifteen years life expectancy.
b.
Trunk is relatively sound and solid with no extensive decay.
c.
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwood trees only).
d.
No major insect or pathological problem.
C.
In order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees, which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two times the assigned unit value shown in Appendix B. The critical root zone of specimen trees will be protected with hog-back/wire-back tree save fencing with metal support posts.
D.
If a specimen tree is to be removed, a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for the removal shall be submitted to the city arborist.
E.
Specimen trees that cannot be saved (see Section 15.38.090(D)) shall be replaced with trees having three times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper by species with potentials for comparable size and quality.
F.
Any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the city arborist shall be replaced by trees with a total density equal to eight times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. Violations will be subject to the applicable penalties as described in Section 15.38.170.
