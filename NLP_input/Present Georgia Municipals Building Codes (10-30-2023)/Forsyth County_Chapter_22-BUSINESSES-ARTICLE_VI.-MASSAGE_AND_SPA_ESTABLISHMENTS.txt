ARTICLE VI. - MASSAGE AND SPA ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 22-223. - Purpose and legislative findings.
The Georgia General Assembly has declared that the licensed practice of massage therapy by health care professionals is an activity affecting and benefiting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public but that the illegal and illicit practice of physical and bodily manipulation by a person who is not licensed under the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 43-24A-1, et seq.) is a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The board of commissioners agrees with those findings. Furthermore, the board of commissioners finds that, for some massage establishments, the business in fact is sexual conduct or the intimation of sexual conduct, rather than lawful massage therapy. Such establishments offer massage services as a subterfuge for prostitution, masturbation for hire, and other paid sexual contact, which are harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. There is difficulty and expense in conclusively distinguishing between such establishments and legitimate massage or spa establishments by licensed or certified health care professionals, but one criteria that may assist in distinguishing a legitimate versus illegitimate operator is whether the establishment has a relationship with a corporate or franchising hierarchy, which would tend to provide a check against unlawful sexual activities on the massage establishment premises because illegal activity would have repercussions on the corporate/franchise affiliation. The recitation of this criterion is not intended to impugn the integrity or motivation of the many wholly-independent, legitimate providers; it is simply one of many factors that may be legitimately considered. It is a purpose of this article to impose county licensing requirements to help prevent illegal massage, prostitution, sex trafficking and related sex crimes, without hindering legitimate massage or spa establishments operating under a business structure with external oversight that serves that purpose. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22 (allowing local regulation of massage businesses and of persons not licensed by the state), it is the purpose of this article to regulate the operation of massage and spa establishments, and to regulate employees of such establishments who are not licensed as massage therapists by the state, as an exercise of the county's police power in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the county.

The sheriff may exempt a massage establishment or a spa establishment owned or operated by a licensed massage therapist and its employees and licensed contractors from the licensing requirements of sections 22-227, 22-228, and 22-229 for a specified calendar year. An exemption under this subsection expires on December 31 of the year for which it was granted. Upon the expiration of an exemption, the establishment and its employees are subject to all requirements of sections 22-227, 22-228, and 22-229. Any request for an exemption shall be submitted in writing to the sheriff. The request for an exemption is automatically rejected unless the sheriff grants the exemption. An exemption, if granted by the sheriff, shall be issued in writing and shall be based upon the following, non-exhaustive list of considerations:

Whether the establishment is operated by a person who has been continually licensed pursuant to the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act for at least four years. The four-year consideration evidences that a licensed individual has secured and maintained the license for a reasonable duration. However, possessing a license for less than four years shall not automatically preclude receipt of an exemption.
