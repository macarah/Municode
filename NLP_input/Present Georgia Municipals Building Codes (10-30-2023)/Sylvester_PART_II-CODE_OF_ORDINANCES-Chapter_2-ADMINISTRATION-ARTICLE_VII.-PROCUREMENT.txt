(hereinafter referred to as the "Act") and its implementing regulations govern the procurement, management, and administration of certain engineering, architectural, and design related projects which are funded by the Federal-Aid Highway Program (herein referred to as "FAHP.") The Act establishes a qualifications-based selection process, in which contracts are negotiated on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at a fair and reasonable price. The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations.
(b)
Definitions. Any term used in this section shall have the meaning prescribed by the Brooks Act, 23 U.S.C.A. § 101 et. seq. and its implementing regulations. See 23 U.S.C.A. § 101, 23 U.S.C.A. § 112(b)(2), 40 U.S.C.A. § 1103 et. seq., 23 C.F.R. § 172.3, and 48 C.F.R. § 31.001.
(c)
Applicability and governing law. Notwithstanding any other provision contained within this article, except as provided in sections (h) and (i) below, the city shall utilize the procurement methods set forth in sections (d), (e), (f), and (g) below for the procurement of engineering and design related services when FAHP funds are involved in the contract, as further specified in 23 U.S.C.A. § 112(b)(2)(A).
To the extent that any provision contained within this section is in conflict with or inconsistent with the Act and its implementing regulations, or any other applicable federal law or regulation, then the procedures set forth in this section shall yield to the provisions set forth within the applicable federal law or regulation.
(d)
Competitive solicitation. The solicitation process shall be by public announcement, public advertisement, or any other public forum or method that assures qualified in-state and out-of-state consultants are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the contract. Procurement procedures may involve a single step process with issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to all interested consultants or a multiphase process with issuance of a request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications (RFQ) whereby responding consultants are ranked based on qualifications and request for proposals are then provided to three or more of the most highly qualified consultants. Minimum qualifications of consultants to perform services under general work categories or areas of expertise may also be assessed through a prequalification process whereby statements of qualifications are submitted on an annual basis. Regardless of any process utilized for prequalification of consultants or for an initial assessment of a consultant's qualifications under an RFQ, a RFP specific to the project, task, or service is required for evaluation of a consultant's specific technical approach and qualifications.
(e)
Competitive evaluation criteria.
(1)
Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of consultants to perform engineering and design related services must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance.
(2)
Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. All price or cost related items which include, but are not limited to, cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs are prohibited from being used as evaluation criteria.
(3)
In-state or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. State licensing laws are not preempted by this provision and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement which attests to the minimum qualifications and competence of a consultant to perform the solicited services.
(4)
The following non-qualifications based evaluation criteria are permitted under the specified conditions and provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed a nominal value of ten percent of the total evaluation criteria to maintain the integrity of a qualifications-based selection:
a.
A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criterion shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a consultant to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified consultants, given the nature and size of the project. If a consultant outside of the locality area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criteria.
b.
The participation of qualified and certified disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) sub-consultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 C.F.R. Part 26.
(f)
Competitive evaluation, ranking, and selection.
(1)
Evaluation criteria. Consultant proposals shall be evaluated by the city based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation and based on the methods and procedures set forth herein.
(2)
Sub-consultants. While the contract will be with the prime consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the prime consultant and any sub-consultants identified within the proposal.
(3)
Evaluation and discussions. Following submission and evaluation of proposals, the city shall conduct interviews or other types of discussions determined three of the most highly qualified consultants to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP and to discuss anticipated concepts and compare alternative methods for furnishing services. Discussion requirements shall be specified within the RFP and should be based on the size and complexity of the project. Discussions may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation or interview. Discussions following proposal submission are not required provided proposals contain sufficient information for evaluation of technical approach and qualifications to perform the specific project, task, or service with respect to established criteria.
(4)
Ranking. From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which have been conducted, the city shall rank, in order of preference, at least three consultants determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria.
(5)
Notification. Notification must be provided to responding consultants of the final ranking of the three most highly qualified consultants.
(g)
Negotiation.
(1)
In general. The city shall negotiate a contract at compensation which the city determines is fair and reasonable. In determining fair and reasonable compensation, the city shall consider the scope, complexity, professional nature, and estimated value of the services to be rendered.
(2)
Order of negotiation. The city shall attempt to negotiate a contract with the most highly qualified firm selected under section (f)(4) above. If the city is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm, the city shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the next most qualified of the selected firms, continuing the process until an agreement is reached. If the city is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the city shall select additional firms in order of their competence and qualification and continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.
(3)
Independent estimate. Prior to receipt or review of the most highly qualified consultant's cost proposal, the city shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and consultant's fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation and ensuring the consultant services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost.
(4)
