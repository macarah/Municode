(Res. No. 2014-39, exh. A, 8-9-2014)
Sec. 44-34. - Record of transactions.
Throughout the term of the license, every pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler shall report/upload to LeadsOnline, or the county's current electronic reporting system, the below listed information for each and every transaction conducted during each day they were open for business by the end of that business day. All information shall be recorded in the English language.
A transaction shall consist of all articles brought in to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn by an individual (pawner/seller) at the same time and date, and includes the sale of non-junk/scrap articles by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to another person. Non-junk/scrap articles purchased by a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler from another business shall not be considered to be transactions for the purposes of this section, and are exempt from the reporting requirements of this section, and are also exempt from the waiting period established under section 44-38. Articles brought in to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn at different times on the same date by the same person shall be considered as separate transactions, regardless of how short the difference in time is between those transactions. Separate transactions, either from the same person or different persons, shall not be combined and reported collectively.
(1)
Non-junk/scrap articles other than coins and paper money.
a.
Purchases/receipts by licensees.
i.
Reserved.
ii.
All such articles sold, bartered, traded, pledged or pawned to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer or secondary metals recycler by an individual (pawner/seller) during a transaction shall be associated with the person (pawner/seller) who brought the article(s) in. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction:
1.
The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller.
2.
A digital photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the pawner/seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors.
3.
Reserved.
4.
The date and time of the transaction.
iii.
Descriptions/photographs of articles.
1.
Individually identifiable articles:
(a)
Each individually identifiable non-junk/scrap article brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a single transaction shall be itemized separately. Pawnbroker or secondhand dealer licensees shall not lump such articles together (e.g., "five gold monogrammed rings"), but must provide a complete and thorough description of each item to include the following:
(i)
Type of article.
(ii)
Brand name/make/manufacturer (if applicable).
(iii)
Model number (if applicable).
(iv)
Serial number (if applicable).
(v)
Color/finish.
(vi)
Any other identifying marks, writing, engraving, etc.
(b)
A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each individually identifiable article, sufficiently detailed to allow reasonable identification of the article. The digital photograph(s) shall capture any identifying numbers, marks, writing, engraving, etc., or any other distinguishing characteristics.
(c)
Each individually identifiable non-junk/scrap article brought into a secondary metals recycler shall maintain a legible description of all purchase transactions as outlined in O.C.G.A. § 10-1-353 and must include the following:
(i)
Weight, quantity, or volume and a description of the type of regulated metal property purchased in a purchase transaction. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term "type of regulated metal property" shall include a physical description, such as aluminum cans, copper 12GA wire, galvanized tubing;
(ii)
A digital photograph or photographs where a single photograph is not sufficient to show the regulated metal property in a reasonably clear manner. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term, "reasonably clear manner" shall include images that will accurately reflect the detailed transaction recorded by the secondary metals recycler.
(iii)
Reserved.
(2)
Non-individually identifiable articles:
(a)
Articles that cannot be distinguished from any other similar articles may be described in groups of similar types of articles, but only within the same transaction made by the same seller/pawner. Licensees shall provide reasonable descriptions of the number and types of items within each group to enable the sheriff's office to determine if they may have been stolen during a particular crime. Example: an individual pawner/seller brings in a video game controller, five video game discs, and numerous items of jewelry. The licensee would first of all have to individually itemize and photograph the video game controller as outlined in "Individually identifiable articles" above, as it would be a serially-numbered item. As for the remaining items, the licensee shall not list them as "Miscellaneous video games and jewelry." Instead, the licensee shall describe them as follows: "Five video game discs to include the following titles...." and "Miscellaneous jewelry to include two yellow gold necklaces, one silver necklace, two pairs of silver earrings, one women's yellow, gold ring, one women's white gold diamond ring and two silver bracelets."
(b)
A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each group of similar types of articles within each transaction made by the same seller/pawner. The articles may be photographed together as a group, but each individual article shall be visible in the photograph. For example, given the circumstances outlined in subsection (a) above, the five video game discs would be photographed together as a group side-by-side (not stacked on top of each other), and the jewelry items would be photographed together as a group with each item laid out so as to be individually viewable (not piled together in a heap).
b.
Sales by licensees.
i.
In order to facilitate the return of stolen items to their rightful owners, individually identifiable non-junk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual shall be reported to LeadsOnline. Licensees shall individually itemize and describe each individually identifiable article so sold.
ii.
Each individually identifiable non-junk/scrap article sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be associated with the person to whom it was sold. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: (1) The name and current address of the purchaser must be recorded/reported; a photographic image of a government-issued photo ID card is not necessary. (2) A digital photograph of non-junk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual is not required.
iii.
As there is no lawful basis for confiscating and returning property to the victim of a crime that cannot be individually identified as having been stolen from the victim, reporting the sale of non-individually identifiable articles by a licensee to LeadsOnline is not required.
(2)
Junk/scrap articles.
a.
Purchases by licensees.
i.
Junk/scrap articles may be recorded/reported in bulk, but must specify the weight, type (e.g., steel, copper, aluminum, etc.) and form (e.g. sheet, pipe, wire, etc.) of the bulk material. Junk/scrap articles purchased by secondary metals recyclers shall adhere to the prescription provided in subsection (l)a.iii.(c).
ii.
Each different type and form of junk/scrap bulk material brought in to a secondhand dealer by an individual for sale during a transaction shall be associated with the person who brought the material in. Licensees shall record/report the following information for each such transaction:
(1)
The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller.
(2)
A photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors.
(3)
If the seller is selling on behalf of a company or business, the name, address, and telephone number of such company or business shall also be recorded/reported.
(4)
If the junk/scrap is brought by motor vehicle to a licensee for sale, the make, model, color, and license plate number of that vehicle shall be recorded/reported.
(5)
The date and time of the transaction.
(6)
A digital photograph or, if the licensee has a video system, video segment of each individual type and form of bulk material purchased by the licensee shall be linked to the record of that transaction.
b.
Sales by licensees.
i.
Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of junk/scrap material.
ii.
Reserved.
(3)
Coins and paper money.
a.
Purchases/receipts by licensees.
i.
Coins have no distinguishing characteristics that separate them from other coins of the same mintage, and although paper money is serial numbered, those serial numbers are so seldom known by their last possessor that paper money is effectively indistinguishable from other paper money of the same denomination. Furthermore, unlike coins made of precious metals, paper money seldom carries any value significantly beyond the face value of the bill, and when stolen is usually used directly as cash and not sold to a currency dealer. Accordingly, coins or paper money brought in by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a single transaction do not need to be itemized individually, but rather may be recorded/reported in bulk.
ii.
Coins or paper money brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a transaction shall be associated with the person (pawner/seller) who brought the article in. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction:
1.
The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller.
2.
A digital photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the pawner/seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors.
3.
The date and time of the transaction.
4.
The quantities and types of coins or paper money present. If coins are all of the same type, they shall be reported by either quantity or weight, and type (e.g., 5 Morgan silver dollars, 12 buffalo nickels, 5 lbs. of wheat pennies, etc.). If coins are from a collection, a description of the theme of the collection (e.g., Bicentennial coins, state quarters, etc.) along with the number of coins shall be provided. If coins represent an accumulation of disparate coins with no overall theme, a generic description of the type and quantity of coins shall be provided (e.g., approximately 200 U.S. coins of miscellaneous dates and denominations, approximately 100 foreign coins from various countries, etc.). Paper money shall be reported by quantity and type (e.g., 12 U.S. $5.00 silver certificates, etc.).
iii.
As a photograph of coins or paper money conveys no more information than can be obtained from the written descriptions required by subsection (3)a.ii.(d) of this section, no photographs of coins or paper money are required.
b.
Sales by licensees.
i.
Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of coins or paper money to other individuals or businesses.
1.
In the event the electronic reporting system malfunctions or is otherwise not operational, the licensee shall, at all times during such malfunction or non-operation, be required to keep written records of any and all transactions made during the period of malfunction or non-operation, to include all information required by this section. These written records shall be reported/uploaded to LeadsOnline, or the county's current electronic reporting system, as soon as practicable after the electronic reporting system is functional. No such written records shall be erased, mutilated or changed. Written records shall be open and available for review upon request by any peace officer during regular business hours.

No pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall expose for sale, or sell, trade or barter, or melt, crush/compact, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, any non-scrap/junk article that is individually identifiable within 30 days of the time of purchasing or receiving the same, nor until the same has been in or upon the premises where the same are offered, exposed, traded, bartered or sold, at least 30 days, unless the article consists primarily of precious metal(s). Due to fluctuations in the prices of precious metals and security concerns emanating from the accumulation of large quantities of precious metals, there shall be no waiting period for such articles, even if they are individually identifiable.
There shall be no waiting period for scrap/junk, coins, paper money or other non-individually identifiable articles.
