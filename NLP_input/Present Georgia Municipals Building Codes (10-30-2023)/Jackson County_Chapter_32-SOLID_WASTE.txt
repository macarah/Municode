(2)
Biomedical waste shall be segregated by separate containment from other waste at the point of origin.
a.
Biomedical waste, except for sharps, shall be placed in containers which are impervious to moisture and have a strength sufficient to preclude ripping, tearing, or bursting under normal conditions of use.

(3)
Biomedical waste shall be delivered for storage, including intermediate transfer, and treatment only to a facility or location for which there is a valid and appropriate operating permit as set forth in this article.
(4)
Surfaces of transport vehicles that have contacted spilled or leaked biomedical waste shall be decontaminated.
(5)
Packaged biomedical waste may not be compacted or shredded prior to delivery to the treatment or disposal facility unless such compaction or shredding is in conjunction with chemical or other treatment which renders the waste noninfectious.
(e)

a.
Incineration in an incinerator which provides complete combustion of waste to render it nonpathogenic.
1.
Biomedical waste incinerators shall be capable of maintaining a minimum temperature in the primary chamber sufficient to destroy infectious agents and produce a residue essentially free of odors and unstable organic matter. If chemotherapy wastes are incinerated, the incinerator must be capable of maintaining a minimum of, 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit in the secondary combustion chamber and a minimum residence time of two seconds.
2.
Atmospheric emissions shall be controlled so as not exceed air quality standards of the department of natural resources, environmental protection division.

Decontamination by heating with steam under pressure (autoclave) so as to render the biomedical waste noninfectious.
1.
Recording of the thermometer during each complete cycle shall be used to ensure the attainment of a temperature of 121 degrees Centigrade (250 degrees Fahrenheit) for one-half hour or longer in order to achieve decontamination of the entire load.
2.
Monitoring of the steam sterilization process shall be required in order to confirm the attainment of decontamination.
3.
Monitoring may be through the use of biological indicators or other methods as approved by the board of commissioners.
c.
Other methods as may be approved by the board of commissioners.

(1)
Biomedical wastes treated in accordance with the provisions contained in this section shall be properly disposed of at a facility permitted under the authority of this article unless otherwise approved by the board of commissioners.
(2)
Until such time as treatment is required, untreated biomedical waste shall be placed in the working face of a permitted sanitary landfill such that the disposal operations do not destroy the integrity of the biomedical waste containers, until sufficient nonbiomedical waste has been placed over the biomedical waste to preclude exposure of site workers to the contents of the containers upon handling and compaction.

Sec. 32-137. - Findings.
It is hereby found and determined that:
(1)
Indiscriminate littering and other illegal dumping of solid or liquid waste and hazardous substances is known to be harmful to the environment and a blight to the landscape;
(2)
The creation of a reward or bounty system will offer an incentive for the general public to report such illegal activity, thereby augmenting the capability of the county to monitor and to prevent indiscriminate littering and other illegal dumping throughout the county;
(3)
A reward or bounty system has been used by other governmental agencies with favorable results, curbing the amount and type of littering and other illegal dumping; and
(4)
Generating publicity pertaining to the bounty authorized by this article constitutes a public purpose in that it will increase the public's awareness of the adverse environmental and social effects of littering and other illegal dumping and the judicial consequences that can result therefrom and will thereby reduce littering and other illegal dumping within the county.
(Code 2005, § 66-121; Ord. of 8-19-1993(1), § 1)
Sec. 32-138. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

(Code 2005, § 66-122; Ord. of 8-19-1993(1), § 2)
Sec. 32-139. - Development and implementation of program.
The county marshal is hereby authorized and directed to develop and implement a bounty payment program for the reporting of unlawful littering or dumping when such reporting results in a successful criminal prosecution against the person or entity reported.
(Code 2005, § 66-123; Ord. of 8-19-1993(1), § 3)
Sec. 32-140. - Guidelines.
The bounty payment program to be developed and implemented by the county marshal shall conform to the following general guidelines:
(1)
The bounty amount payable shall be $100.00 to $500.00 for each successful criminal prosecution against a person or entity. Separate counts or charges contained within the same governmental prosecuting document shall not be stacked or cumulated to create more than one successful criminal prosecution per prosecuting document.
(2)
To be eligible for payment of a bounty, the report of the unlawful littering or dumping must be made by the person claiming the bounty to the county staff person authorized by the county marshal to receive the report and the information reported must lead to a successful criminal prosecution of a person or entity for the unlawful littering or dumping reported.
(3)
The amount of the bounty will be determined based on the seriousness of the reported activity, the duration of the violation, the usefulness of the information reported in obtaining the successful criminal prosecution, and the willingness and ability of the reporting person to participate in the successful criminal prosecution. First in time reports containing the same essential information as subsequent reports shall be deemed the more useful of the reports. The county marshal may require that the bounty for a successful criminal prosecution be equitably divided between one or more persons eligible to receive the bounty.
(4)
The statute of limitation must not have expired on the alleged unlawful littering or dumping.
(5)
Although anonymity cannot be guaranteed to a person making a report concerning unlawful littering or dumping, the county marshal shall use his best efforts consistent with the laws of state to protect the confidentiality of the person making the report if such persons making the report requests such confidentiality.
(6)
Bounties paid pursuant to this article are hereby approved and shall be paid from the county's landfill fund.
