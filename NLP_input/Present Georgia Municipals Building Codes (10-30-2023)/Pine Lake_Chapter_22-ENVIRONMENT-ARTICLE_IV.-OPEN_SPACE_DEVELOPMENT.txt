ARTICLE IV. - OPEN SPACE DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 22-79. - Purposes.
The purposes of the open space development are as follows:
(1)
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure.
(2)
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
(3)
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
(4)
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
(5)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
(6)
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
(7)
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
(8)
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
(9)
To encourage street designs that reduces traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
(10)
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the city and connected to neighboring communities, businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
(11)
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
(l2)
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.

Sec. 22-80. - General regulations.
(a)
Applicability of regulations. This conservation of open space option is available on all properties zoned residential in the city as a use by right. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.
(b)
Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(c)
Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the subdivision shall be determined, at the discretion of the local jurisdiction, by either of the following two methods:
(1)
Calculation. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
a.
Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;
b.
The 100-year floodplain;
c.
Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area;
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act ("Federal Water Pollution Control Act" 33 USC 1251 et seq.); or
e.
Anticipated right-of-way needs for roads and utilities.
(2)
Yield plan. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional city design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
(Code 1986, ยง 6-1-14B(2))
Sec. 22-81. - Application requirements.
(a)
Site analysis map required. Concurrent with the submission of a site concept plan, the applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed open space will meet the requirements of this article. The preliminary site plan shall include the following features:
(1)
Property boundaries;
(2)
All streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features;
(3)
Topographic contours of no less than ten-foot intervals;
(4)
All primary and secondary conservation areas labeled by type, as described in section 22-82;
(5)
General vegetation characteristics;
(6)
General soil types;
(7)
The planned location of protected open space;
(8)
Existing roads and structures; and
(9)
Potential connections with existing greenspace and trails.
(b)
Open space management plan required. An open space management plan, as described in section 22-82, shall be prepared and submitted prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
(c)
Instrument of permanent protection required. An instrument of permanent protection, such as a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant and as described in section 22-82, shall be placed on the open space concurrent with the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
(d)
Other requirements. The applicant shall adhere to all other applicable requirements of the underlying zoning and the building code.
(Code 1986, ยง 6-1-14B(3))
Sec. 22-82. - Open space.
(a)
Definition. The term "open space" means the portion of the city that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument.
(b)
Standards to determine open space.
(1)
The minimum restricted open space shall comprise at least 40 percent of the gross tract area.
(2)
The following are considered primary conservation areas and are required to be included within the open space, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this article:
a.
The regulatory 100-year floodplain;
b.
Buffer zones of at least 75-foot width along all perennial and intermittent streams;
c.
Slopes above 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition used by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act ("Federal Water Pollution Control Act" 33 USC 1251 et seq.);
e.
Populations of endangered or threatened species, or habitat for such species; and
f.
Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds.
(3)
The following are considered secondary conservation areas and should be included within the open space to the maximum extent feasible.
a.
Important historic sites;
b.
Existing healthy, native forests of at least one acre contiguous area;
c.

Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space.
(5)
At least 75 percent of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract. The open space should adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, other protected areas, and nonprotected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected open space.
(6)
The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Nonadjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space.
(c)
Permitted uses of open space. Uses of open space may include the following:

The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions; or
2.
A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this article;
3.
If the entity accepting the easement is not the city, then a third right of enforcement favoring the city shall be included in the easement;
