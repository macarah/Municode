(Ord. of 6-1-10(2), § 1)
Sec. 5-166. - Address number assignment.
Address assignment shall be based upon the type descriptions listed below. Addresses shall be supplied only for habitable structures and devices with existing telephone service. Addresses for proposed habitable structures not within major subdivisions (as defined by Whitfield County Code of Ordinances, section 15-21(3)) will be provided only after the final location of ingress and egress to the structure and the final location of the structure are evident on the ground so that the correct and final GPS location of the structure, as an access point can be located. An address will be provided for all final building permit applications. Addresses for proposed structures within major subdivisions may be provided after final plat approval has been obtained. Devices with telephone service will be provided an address when permanent position of the device can be located using GPS. The address administrator shall have the authority to assign and to correct addresses not in compliance with this article. Appeals of any decision by the addressing administrator shall be heard and decided by the committee, as set forth in section 5-163(c)(6).
(a)
Frontage interval address style. Address numbers shall be assigned to each structure, as defined herein, a "location number" based upon its distance (i.e., the number of 10.56-foot segments) from the origin point of the road to the center point of the access drive.
(b)
Odd/even number location. Numbers are odd on the left hand side of the road and even on the right side of the road as the numbers increase.
(c)
Fractional, alphanumeric, hyphenated addresses. There shall be no use of fractional addresses, alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers. This provision shall apply to apartment numbers and suite numbers as well as to secondary location indicators such as apartment numbers and suite number.
(d)
Component order. Components of a road address shall always be in the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), road name and road type, designation of apartment or suite, and apartment/suite number.
(e)
Diagonal roads. Diagonal roads shall be treated as either north-south or east-west roads. Once orientation is established it shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. The orientation will not change even if the road changes direction. Within developments it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road.
(f)
Circular roads. A circular road is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road. Circular roads shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road. The outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered to match and mix with the outside. This will result, in most cases, with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between the inside numbers. Numbering sequence of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road retaining odd/even designations on the appropriate side of the circular road.
(g)
Culs-de-Sac. Culs-de-sac shall be addressed using the system based on the baseline/meridian structure; odd/even numbers on the appropriate sides of the road and meeting at the mid-point, or the back of the cul-de-sac.
(h)
Corner lots. It is preferable for corner lots to be addressed to the road off which the driveway is accessed. However, corner lots have the option of being addressed to the driveway or the front of the structure. Display of address numbers on the structure shall face the road to which the home is addressed. The assigned address will be determined by the site plan presented at the time a building permit is requested.
(i)
Private drives/easements. Private drives/easements may be addressed to an existing adjoining road when they serve no more than two lots or structures. Private drives and easements serving more than two lots or structures shall be addressed to the private drive/easement.
(j)
Single-family dwellings. A single-family dwelling shall receive its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction.
(k)
Duplexes/apartment residences/office buildings/strip commercial buildings. Structures of this type shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual unit being assigned unit/suite numbers as secondary location indicators. The unit number assigned should indicate the floor location (e.g., "Unit 204" is the fourth unit on the second floor). Alphanumeric numbers are not permitted. Buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of units, shall require an address for each individual entrance. Careful planning shall be taken to reserve enough numbers for future divisions of units/suites.
(l)
Mobile/manufactured home parks. Each individual mobile home or manufactured home shall be assigned its own individual address following the basic rules for distance and direction. This generally results in leaving four to eight numbers between adjacent sites.
(m)
Townhouses. Townhouses individually owned and not part of an apartment complex shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. Townhouses under the apartment category will be addressed as apartments, with the main building receiving one address and each individual townhouse being assigned apartment numbers as secondary locators.
(n)
Condominiums. Condominiums shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. An apartment building or townhouse complex that is converted to a condominium shall be required to be addressed with an individual address for each unit.
(o)
Individual commercial buildings. Individual commercial buildings shall be given one address to the road on which the driveway access is located as determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When a business faces a main road, but is accessed from a secondary road, an address will be allowed to the main road if the primary entrance faces the main road. An individual building, housing more than one business, shall require a separate address for each unit. Suite numbers shall not be allowed. A large retail complex/superstore that houses one main retail business with additional smaller retail spaces within (e.g., Grocery store with cleaners, bank, hair salon etc.) shall be assigned one address for the use of all businesses located within the main structure. This address shall be posted on the outside of the main building in a manner that it is legible to the public as well as emergency responders.
(p)
Miscellaneous/secondary structures. Outbuildings and/or utilities requiring metering or possessing land line telephone service are required to have their own individual address, generally four to six numbers from the main residence. Outbuildings having their own access drive shall be assigned an address following the basic rules for distance and direction.
(q)
Wireless towers. A wireless tower shall be assigned one address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When additional carriers are collocated thereon, all carriers, including the first carrier, will be assigned a suite number with the address.
(r)
Flag lots. Buildings obtaining access through a panhandle to a public road will be addressed to the public road to which they obtain access. If the lot contains two or more principal structures and share a common access, the access itself shall be named as a road for addressing purposes.
(s)
Special case lots/parcels. Special case lots developed facing a named road with access provided by a private alley, from a side road, shall be numbered to the facing road. Individual buildings on lots created facing an unnamed driveway shall be addressed off the public street from which it gains access. If the structure is more than 150 feet from the named road or is not visible from the named road, the address number shall be displayed on the structure and at the end of the driveway or easement that provides access to the structures, and be visible and legible from all directions of travel.
(Ord. of 6-1-10(2), § 1)
Sec. 5-167. - Road naming.

All roads that serve three or more habitable structures shall be named regardless of whether the ownership is by public road or private road.
(c)
A road name assigned by Whitfield County shall not constitute or imply acceptance of the road into the county road system.
