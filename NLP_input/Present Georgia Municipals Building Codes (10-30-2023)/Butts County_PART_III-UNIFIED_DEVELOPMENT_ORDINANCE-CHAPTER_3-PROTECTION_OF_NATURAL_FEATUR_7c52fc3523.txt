Sec. 3.03.01. - Findings and purpose.
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Butts County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threaten the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of Butts County (and Henry County with respect to the Tussahaw Creek, Peeksville Creek, Wolf Creek, Malholms Creek, their tributaries, and the Tussahaw Reservoir); to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the following watersheds which occur within the jurisdiction of Butts County and are hereinafter identified as water supply watersheds.
