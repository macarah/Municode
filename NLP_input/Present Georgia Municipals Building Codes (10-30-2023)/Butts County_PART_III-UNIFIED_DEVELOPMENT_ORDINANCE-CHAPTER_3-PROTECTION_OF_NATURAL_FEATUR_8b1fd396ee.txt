Sec. 3.01.06. - Basis for area of special flood hazard.
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its most recent applicable flood insurance study (FIS), with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article.
For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto for Butts County, are hereby adopted by reference.
Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS such as the United States Geological Survey Ocmulgee River Flood study presented to Butts County in 1995.
The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps, and other supporting data is located in the Butts County community development department.
