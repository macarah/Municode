The yard and other space requirements of the district in which the property is located may be reduced by the smallest amount that will permit reasonable use of the property as a building site. Such reduction of these space requirements shall constitute a variance. However, in no case shall the building inspector permit any lot in a residential district to be used as a building site which is less than one-half of the district's minimum area and yard requirements as set forth in article VI of this chapter. Further, the building inspector shall grant variances only upon finding that all of the following conditions exist:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography;
(2)
The application of this chapter would create an unnecessary hardship;
(3)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this chapter;
(4)
The special circumstances surrounding the request for a variance are not the result of acts by the applicant; and
(5)
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings, or structures which is not permitted by right or by conditional use permit in the district involved. Use variances are specifically prohibited by the 1957 General Planning and Zoning Enabling Act, as amended.
