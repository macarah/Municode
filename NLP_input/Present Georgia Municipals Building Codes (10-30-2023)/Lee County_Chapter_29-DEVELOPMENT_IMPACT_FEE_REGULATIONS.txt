(2)
Any building for which a valid and complete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of this chapter may proceed without payment of fees otherwise imposed by this chapter, provided that:
a.
All fees and development exactions in effect prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be or have been paid in full; and,

(c)
Method of calculation.
(1)
Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and which:
a.
Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and
b.
Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed.
(3)
The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this chapter shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Lee County, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act.
(4)
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(5)
Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(Ord. of 7-11-2006, § 4)
Sec. 29-5. - Fee assessment and payment.
(a)
Fee schedule.
(1)
Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A [codified at the end of this chapter] for a property located inside of Lee County, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the county, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(2)
When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure.
(3)
In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then:
a.
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee.
b.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule.
c.
If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this chapter, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the county's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the board of commissioners.
d.
Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter.
(b)
Timing of assessment and payment.
(1)
Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit.
(2)
All development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building.
(3)
For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property.
(4)
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid.
(5)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.
(c)
Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows:
(1)
At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A.
(2)
In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall:
a.
Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or,

Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the county or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and,
c.
Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination.
(3)
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this chapter. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter.
(4)
Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the county, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(d)
Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim.
(Ord. of 7-11-2006, § 5)
Sec. 29-6. - Exemptions.
(a)
Exemption policy. The board of commissioners finds that certain office, retail trade or industrial uses that create unusually high investment, economic or job creation benefits represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the county in proportion to the creation of such benefits. To encourage such development projects, the board of commissioners may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the county, in accordance with adopted exemption criteria. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.
(b)
Process for exemption approval. An application for exemption shall be considered under the following procedures:
(1)
Application for exemption approval must be made by the building permit applicant to the administrator. A building permit may be issued upon approval of an exemption, or may be issued without payment of applicable impact fees following receipt of a complete exemption application and pending its approval, but a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until a decision regarding the exemption has been made, or until such time that the application for exemption is otherwise withdrawn by the applicant and payment of impact fees have been paid.
(2)
Documentation must be provided to the administrator that demonstrates the applicant's eligibility for an exemption. This documentation shall address, but need not be limited to, all applicable exemption criteria adopted by the county. This documentation constitutes the application for exemption.
(3)
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether an application for exemption addresses the exemption criteria adopted by the county and is complete. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter.
(4)
The administrator or the board of commissioners shall determine the eligibility for and extent of exemption, in accordance with the standards and procedures contained in the exemption criteria adopted by the board of commissioners. If action by the board of commissioners is required, the application for exemption shall be considered at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners that falls at least two weeks after a complete application for exemption has been received by the administrator.

In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.
(b)
Granting of credits.
(1)
Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that:
a.
The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan;
b.
The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and,
c.
The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer.
(2)
The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 29-9 of this chapter.
(c)
Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
(1)
For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated.
(2)
For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated.
(3)
For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the county would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less.
(4)
For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.
(5)
In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.
(d)
Credits; application.
(1)
Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.

Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment.
(e)
Credits; abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the county, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.
(Ord. of 7-11-2006, § 8)
Sec. 29-9. - Refunds.
(a)
Eligibility for a refund.
(1)
Upon the request of a feepayor regarding a property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the development impact fee shall be refunded if:
a.
Capacity is available in the public facilities for which the fee was collected but service is permanently denied; or,
b.
The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six years after the date the fee was collected.

In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
(b)
Notice of entitlement to a refund. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected and shall contain a heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." No refund shall be made for a period of 30 days from the date of said publication.
(c)
Filing a request for a refund. All requests for refunds shall be made in writing to the administrator within one year of the time the refund becomes payable or within one year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later.
