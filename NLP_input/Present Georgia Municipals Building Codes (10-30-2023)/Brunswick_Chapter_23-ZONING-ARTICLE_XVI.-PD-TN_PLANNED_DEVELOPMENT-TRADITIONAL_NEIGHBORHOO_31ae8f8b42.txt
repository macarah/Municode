ARTICLE XVI. - PD-TN PLANNED DEVELOPMENT-TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT

Sec. 23-16-1. - Intent of planned development-traditional neighborhood district.
It is the intent of the PD-TN district to:
(a)
Encourage mixed-use, compact development that is pedestrian in scale, sensitive to the environmental characteristics of the land, and facilitates the efficient use of services within the City of Brunswick;
(b)
Have residences, shopping, employment, and recreational uses located within close proximity with each other and efficiently organized to provide for the daily needs of the residents;
(c)
Provide for a range of housing types within pedestrian-oriented, human-scale neighborhoods; and
(d)
Provide efficient, interconnected circulation systems for pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motorists that serve to functionally and physically integrate the various land use activities.
The planned development-traditional neighborhood provisions can be utilized in two ways:
(a)
These provisions can be applied as a zone district to create new neighborhoods. This zone district will be labeled "PD-TN" for planned development-traditional neighborhood district.
(b)
The planned development provisions can also be used as a conditional use to promote appropriate infill as specified in section 23-16-11. The conditional use will be labeled "PD-TN Infill" for planned development-traditional neighborhood infill.
