Any delay in performing any action under this Act, whether for cause or otherwise, shall not operate to frustrate the overall intent of this Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing it is specifically provided that:
(1)
If it is not possible to hold the referendum election provided for in Section 7.14 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then such referendum shall be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable; and

If it is not possible to hold the first municipal election provided for in Section 2.11 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then there shall be a special election for the initial members of the governing authority to be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, and the commencement of the initial terms of office shall be delayed accordingly.

Members of the charter commission shall be appointed as follows: one by the mayor, one by the city council, and one by each member of the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate whose district lies wholly or partially within the corporate boundaries of the City of South Fulton. All members of the charter commission must reside in the City of South Fulton. The commission must complete the recommendations within six months of its creation. The commission shall make its recommendations in writing directly to each member of the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate whose district lies wholly or partially within the corporate boundaries of the City of South Fulton. The members of the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate whose district lies wholly or partially within the corporate boundaries of the City of South Fulton shall call said charter commission if the mayor and city council fail to call such commission at the time required by this section.

The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.
