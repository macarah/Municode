(1)
In cases involving structures or buildings on the property, if the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or

(e)
If the owner or other person before the court fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, or to abate the condition, as the case may be, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, and/or demolished, or the conditions existing in violation abated as provided in said order.

Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(g)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(1)
The lien provided for in the foregoing paragraph shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, demolition, or other abatement in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Terrell County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 10-71 herein. The Clerk of Superior Court, as required by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(b)(1), shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of Terrell County and shall enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.
(2)
Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this ordinance, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions under this ordinance shall transfer to the city tax collector a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties.

It shall be the duty of the city tax collector to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Chapter 4 of Title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing any tax foreclosure shall not apply. The city tax collector shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city.
(3)
Enforcement of liens pursuant to this ordinance may be initiated at any time following receipt by the city tax collector of the final determination of costs in accordance with this ordinance. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter.
(4)
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this ordinance shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this ordinance together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority and/or the city tax collector in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
(5)
The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(6)
Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
(7)
The public officers designated herein may, in addition to the powers herein granted, issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, option building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article.
