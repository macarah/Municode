ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 4-1. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
(b)
The city finds that the regulation of the location of certain adult establishments is necessary to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city as said establishments would not be appropriate in certain zoning classifications and adjacent to or near certain institutions. The city takes official notice of certain studies which have illustrated harmful secondary negative effects of adult establishments/sexually oriented businesses including increased crime, decreased property values, and increased blight. The city incorporates by reference the testimony of certain experts and individuals who testified at the Gwinnett County board of commissioners hearing on July 17, 2001, who are familiar with conditions resulting in other localities and within Gwinnett County.
(c)
The city finds that adult establishments, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities and may lead to the acceleration of community blight, decrease in property values, and increased allocation of and expenditure in law enforcement and personnel.
(d)
The city also recognizes the right of speech grounded in the state constitution and U.S. Constitution and the manifestation of such through adult/sexually oriented businesses and the products and services they render. In seeking to protect this right, the city finds the regulations set forth herein are the least restrictive means available in balancing this right while furthering the substantial governmental interests set forth above.
