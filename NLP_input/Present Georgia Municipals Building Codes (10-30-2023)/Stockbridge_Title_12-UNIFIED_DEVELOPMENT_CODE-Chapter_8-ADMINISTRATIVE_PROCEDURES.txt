Chapter 8 - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

8.1 - Purpose.
This unified development code sets forth procedures for receiving, reviewing, and rendering decisions on applications for subdivisions, multifamily and nonresidential development, mixed use development, planned developments, and similar permits. This unified development code also sets forth the requirements for appealing decisions, and for enforcement. The procedures and requirements set forth in this unified development code shall be followed in seeking approval of any development.
8.2 - Approval required.
A.
No person shall conduct any development activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Stockbridge without first obtaining approval of a subdivision plat, development plan, construction plans, and permits to perform such activities.
B.
Permits shall only be issued for development on platted and recorded lots.
1.
No permits shall be issued on lots described only by metes and bounds.
2.
All development activities or site work conducted after approval of a subdivision plat or development plan shall conform to the specifications of the approved plans.
C.
Major changes to an approved plan, as defined below, shall require specific approval of an amended plan.
1.
Altering the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site;
2.
Increasing the amount of impervious surface within the development;
3.
Altering the overall density of development;
4.
Substantially increasing the amount of excavation, fill, or removal of vegetation during construction; or
5.
Otherwise altering the overall appearance of the development as proposed as determined by the director.
D.
The following situations are exempt from the requirement to obtain an approved development plan prior to the issuance of required permits:
1.
Repairs to a facility that is part of a previously approved and permitted development.
2.
Accessory structures, provided applicable permits are obtained.
8.2.1 - Expiration of approvals.
A.
Development Permits.
1.
If construction described in a development permit has not commenced within twelve (12) months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. However, the permit may be extended for an additional twelve (12) months, upon payment of the permit fee for such extension.
2.
If construction described in the development permit is suspended after work has commenced, the permit shall expire twelve (12) months after the date the work ceased. In cases of permit expiration due to abandonment or suspension of work, the landowner shall be required to restore topography to its original contours and restore vegetation as determined by the director.
8.2.2 - Fees required.
All fee amounts are determined and adjusted periodically by the mayor and council. All applications shall be accompanied by payment of application fees, as set forth in each department's fee schedule.
8.3 - Application requirements.
8.3.1 - Pre-application conference.
A.
The purpose of the pre-application conference is to provide an opportunity for the applicant to consult with city staff for advice and assistance prior to preparation of a preliminary plat, development plan, and other similar applications. This will enable the applicant to become familiar with the approval process, required documents, inspections, infrastructure and improvement standards adopted by the City of Stockbridge and development factors that may affect the proposed development.
B.
The intent of this unified development code is that all procedural and development requirements be identified during the pre-application conference. However, no person may rely upon any comment concerning a proposed development, or any expression of any nature about the proposal, made by a participant at the pre-application conference, as a representation or implication that the proposal will be ultimately approved or rejected in any form. Additionally, failure of a participant to identify any applicable requirement or condition shall not preclude the city from requiring an applicant to comply with such requirement or condition.
C.
The applicant shall provide the following information:
1.
The City of Stockbridge application for development permit.
2.
Proof of ownership.
3.
When the applicant is a representative of the property owner, a notarized statement authorizing the representative to act as an agent of the property owner with regard to the application and associated procedures.
4.
Applicant campaign disclosure form (for applicant/owner, agent and/or attorney).
5.
A property survey conducted no more than five (5) years prior to the filing of the application, containing the legal description, boundaries, land area, notation whether any portion of the property is within a floodplain, and existing improvements located on the site. Where two (2) or more parcels are included within a proposed development, the survey shall include all parcels that are part of the proposed development, including all phases. The survey shall be prepared and sealed by a surveyor registered in the State of Georgia. If the survey is older than five (5) years, the survey must be certified by a surveyor registered in the State of Georgia as to whether changes have or have not been made to the property.
6.

7.
Proof of payment of fees.
8.
Other information as may be required by the director.
8.3.2 - Determination of completeness.
A.
All applications shall be complete before acceptance for review and decision-making. A determination of completeness is a determination that all required documents and plans have been submitted in sufficient number, and that all fees have been paid. A determination of completeness is not a determination of compliance with substantive standards and criteria.
B.
The director shall determine, within five (5) working days of receipt of an application, whether the application is complete.
C.
If the director determines that the application is not complete, the director shall send notice to the applicant identifying the deficiencies. The applicant shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notice to correct the deficiencies. Until the applicant corrects the deficiencies, no further action shall be taken for processing the application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiencies within the thirty-day period, the application shall be deemed withdrawn, and fees shall be forfeited.
D.
If the director determines that the application is complete, the application shall be processed for review and action.
8.3.3 - Applications subject to administrative action.
