The purposes of this chapter are as follows:
A.
Provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
B.
Preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
C.
Preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
D.
Permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility extensions, necessary for residential development.
E.
Reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
F.
Require interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the Athens-Clarke community.
G.
Require contiguous permanent open space between adjacent parcels.
H.
Encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of open space, play areas and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
I.
Encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reduce reliance on arterial roads.
J.
Conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to, and views of, dedicated open space.
K.
Protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.
L.
Protect the character of surrounding neighborhoods and the quality of life of adjacent residents.
M.
Promote other purposes of the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations, soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance, protected environmental areas ordinance, greenway network plan, and other ordinances and policies of Athens-Clarke County.
(Ord. of 10-7-2003, § 13)
Sec. 9-14A-2. - Applicable land use districts.

Sec. 9-14A-5. - Approval procedure.
A.
The application for the conservation subdivision planned development shall be executed by all property owners, including holders of deeds to secure debt, as recorded in the official records of the Superior Court of Athens-Clarke County, or their authorized agents.
B.
Any request involving the approval of a conservation subdivision planned development shall be considered an amendment to the zoning ordinance, and final approval of the conceptual plan associated with a proposed conservation subdivision planned development shall be administered, processed, and considered as a Type II planning action pursuant to the Type II procedure as defined in Chapter 9-4 of the zoning ordinance. If approved by the governing body, the conservation subdivision planned development regulations shall become the zoning for the property.
C.
Exceptions or variations in the general regulations and standards associated with the underlying zoning district, or exceptions or variations to other applicable requirements of the zoning ordinance, may be requested as part of the preparation and review of the conservation subdivision planned development submittal. Such requests may be approved if the spirit and intent of such requirements are complied with in the total development plan approved for the conservation subdivision planned development.
D.
Conservation subdivision planned development submittals shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined in this chapter.
E.
Approval of the conservation subdivision concept plan shall constitute preliminary plat approval. Procedures for the preparation of the final plat shall comply with section 9-26-2 B.
F.
After review and recommendation by the planning commission, the petitioner must submit the plan to the planning department by noon Monday of the week preceding the week during which the mayor and commission will meet (the Thursday after the third Tuesday of the month). The composition and number of plan copies to be submitted for consideration of the application by the mayor and commission shall be determined by the planning department.
Additionally after review and recommendation by the planning commission, any adjustment or amendment submitted to binding site plans by the petitioner, beyond those recommended by the planning commission, shall be considered a new application and cause the original rezoning request to be returned to the planning commission for reconsideration. All fees normally associated with a rezoning request shall also be applicable.
G.
If the planning commission recommends changes to the binding site plan, and petitioner decides to include such changes to his or her request, then said petitioner must make appropriate changes to the binding site plan, submit said plan in accordance with the provisions of paragraph F above, and will include on the plan a statement signed by the preparer outlining the changes and stating that no other changes have been made except those requested.

2.
The detailed site plan of each project phase shall be drawn to scale, fully dimensioned, and shall include the same information as required for a final plat of the subdivision regulations (Chapter 9-26) and a site review (Chapter 9-25).
3.
The planning director shall approve, and may only approve, the phase site plan if it conforms to the approved concept plan. Any deviation from the concept plan shall be grounds for denial of the phase site plan and shall necessitate the petitioning for approval of an amendment of the concept plan and "CSPD" zoning before the phase site plan can be approved. Approval of the phase site plan will be through a staff permit procedure.
4.
The approval of the phase site plan and related information for each phase shall allow the owner to proceed with the installation of improvements and submit (when appropriate) a final subdivision plat for approval, all in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 9-26.
I.
Compliance. In any event where it is determined by the Athens-Clarke mayor and commission, after referral and/or receipt of a recommendation from the planning commission, that the development of an approved planned development project is not in accordance with this section, the mayor and commission, after holding a public hearing, may amend the zoning ordinance to place parts or all of the property in the planned development district in its prior zoning classification or any other appropriate classification.

e.
Land with slopes greater than 25 percent, of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area.
2.
The minimum requirement for restricted open space shall comprise at least 50 percent of the adjusted tract acreage. Open space shall include primary conservation areas, as identified in section 9-14A-13 B., and may include secondary conservation areas, as identified in section 9-14A-13 C., or other areas of the subject tract. Adjusted tract acreage is defined as the total area of the parcel less following areas:
a.
Land within the 100-year floodplain.
b.
Bodies of open water over 5,000 square feet contiguous area.
c.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
d.
Land lying within the 100-foot or 75-foot riparian buffers identified on the Athens-Clarke County Environmental Areas Map. For state waters not identified on the Environmental Areas Map, land lying within the state-mandated 25-foot riparian buffer shall be subtracted from the total area of the parcel when determining the adjusted development acreage.
e.
Land with slopes greater than 25 percent, of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area.
3.
Maximum lot yield is determined by dividing the area of the adjusted tract acreage by the minimum lot size specified in either the underlying zoning or local health department standards, whichever is greater.
