Sec. 52-2. - Purpose.
This chapter recognizes that signs perform an important function by identifying residences and businesses and facilitating the communication of information to the public. However, minimum control of signs is necessary to minimize visual clutter within the city so as to safeguard life, provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public by providing standards and regulations pertinent to the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs and outdoor advertising structures; to provide protection to the general public from the use of signs that, by their size, motion, color, brightness, illumination, or their distracting demand for attention, endanger the physical and mental well-being of the pubic and create hazards to traffic.
By enacting this chapter, the mayor and council intend to balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; protect the public health, safety and welfare; reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; maintain the historical image of the city; protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs.

The city manager shall have 30 days to complete a review of the application and make a determination as to whether the permit shall issue.

The city manager shall issue a sign construction permit for each application that meets the requirements of this chapter within the time frame provided by subsection (a). After such sign is constructed and in place, the applicant shall notify the city manager within five working days that the sign is ready for final inspection. Final approval shall be issued within five working days, provided the sign has been constructed and located according to the provisions of this chapter and applicable construction and electrical codes. Final approval converts the construction permit into a sign permit without further action of the applicant or city.
(2)
Sign applications that are incomplete, fail to meet the minimum requirements of this chapter, or which do not include payment of required fees, shall be returned to the applicant within 15 days of receipt of an application; the 30-day period for review shall recommence when a completed application is submitted. Should the city manager fail to take action within the mandated 30 days for application review, the permit shall be considered approved; provided further that issuance of a permit caused by delay in review shall not legalize any violation of this chapter or vest any rights to a sign that is prohibited in whole or in part, by this chapter.
(3)
Any applicant who is dissatisfied by a decision of the code enforcement department may appeal such decision to the hearing officer. Such appeal must be in writing and shall be filed within ten business days of the decision being appealed. The city manager will schedule the matter for hearing within 30 days. Final decision on an appeal by a sign applicant shall be made no later than 45 days from the date of filing the appeal. Should the hearing officer fail to take action within the mandated time, the decision under appeal shall be considered overruled.
(b)
In hearing an appeal under this section, the hearing officer shall be bound by the standards contained in this chapter. At the hearing the appellant shall have the right to introduce evidence, may testify, may be represented by counsel, and may cross-examine witnesses. The burden of supporting the decision rests with the city manager. The city clerk will record the appeal proceedings. The appellant has the right to supply a court reporter at his or her own expense, if desired. The hearing officer shall reach a decision within 14 calendar days after hearing. If no decision is made within 45 days of appeal filing, the appeal will be deemed to overrule the city manager's decision. Decisions of the hearing officer to affirm the decision of the city manager or to overrule the decision of the city manager shall be reduced to writing and be served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original decision.
(c)
In the event an applicant whose permit has been denied or a permit holder whose permit has been revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the city manager, such applicant or permit holder may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court.
