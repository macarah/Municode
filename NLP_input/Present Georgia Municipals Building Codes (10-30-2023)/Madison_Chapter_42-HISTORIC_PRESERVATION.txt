(Amd. of 2-8-2016, § 1(Exh.A))
Sec. 42-89. - Alternative action for unusual circumstances.

The commission and the city shall further insure that all designated historic properties and places, sites, buildings, structures and works of art within designated historic districts are kept free from the following structural defects and conditions which threaten the deterioration or loss of such properties. Owners shall maintain their structures as to not endanger the property by permitting the following conditions which jeopardize structural integrity:
(1)
Foundations. Deteriorated or inadequate foundations jeopardize structural integrity. All foundations shall support the structure as originally constructed, and at all points shall be free of holes, wide cracks and buckling.
(2)
Structural members. Defective or deteriorated floor supports, or any structural members of insufficient size to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity. Members of walls, partitions or other vertical supports that split, lean, list or buckle due to defective material or deterioration jeopardize structural integrity. Structural members of ceilings and roofs, or other horizontal structural members, which sag, split or buckle due to defective materials or deterioration or are of insufficient size to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity. Interior staircases shall be maintained in good repair.
(3)
Exterior surfaces and materials. Floors, exterior walls and roofs having holes, wide cracks and loose, warped, protruding or rotting boards or any other condition admitting moisture or other elements jeopardize structural integrity. Exterior surfaces exposed to the weather shall be repaired and weatherproofed, where appropriate, to protect them from further deterioration. Masonry joints shall be maintained. Fireplaces or chimneys which list, bulge or settle due to defective material or deterioration, or are of insufficient size or strength to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity.
(4)
Weather protection and ventilation. Lack of weather protection, any fault or defect in the building which renders it structurally unsafe or not weathertight jeopardizes structural integrity. Windows, exterior doors and exterior siding shall be watertight. Exterior flashing, including that at chimneys, doors, and windows, shall be maintained in good repair. Downspouts and gutters shall be maintained so that rain runoff is directed away from the structure. Foundation and attic vents shall be maintained to ventilate the crawl and attic spaces.
(5)
Stairways, porches and appurtenances. Exterior staircases, porches and appurtenances thereto shall be maintained in good repair.
(6)
Rodent and termite infestation. Structures shall be free of wood boring insects and rodent infestation.
(7)
Security and utilities. Buildings which are no longer occupied shall be properly secured to prevent intrusion, and all utilities shall be properly connected or disconnected.
(8)
Dependencies and additional site features. Ancillary structures and accessory buildings shall be maintained in good repair. Tree limbs shall be trimmed away from the building, and tree roots shall be cleared away from all foundations. Soil erosion and soil deposition shall not be allowed to endanger any structures.

Sec. 42-113. - Failure to provide minimum maintenance and repair.
Owners shall not allow historic properties and places, sites, buildings, structures or works of art within designated historic districts to deteriorate by failing to provide minimum maintenance and repair. The failure to provide minimum maintenance and repair not only adversely impacts the historic and cultural value of the historic community, but due to decay, deterioration and structural defects, jeopardizes structural integrity and poses additional safety hazards. The purpose of this section is to require an owner to engage in the minimum maintenance and repair necessary to correct decay, deterioration, structural defects and safety problems.

Sec. 42-119. - Lien for minimum maintenance and repairs.
At the direction of the mayor and council of the city, minimum maintenance and repair necessary to prevent deterioration or demolition by neglect may be performed by someone other than the owner. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair. The amount of the cost of such maintenance or repair shall be a lien against the real property upon which the maintained or repaired structure is situated. The lien shall attach to the real property at the time of payment of all costs of maintenance or repair by the city, and the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of such costs by the city in the office of the city clerk on a lien docket maintained by the city clerk regarding liens for work performed on unfit buildings. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
(1)
A public officer of the city, or any adult citizens of this state, may execute an affidavit of service reciting that a copy of the notice was served upon such persons either personally, or by leaving a copy at the place of each person's residence. This shall be sufficient evidence as to the proper service of the person in possession, owner and party in interest.
(2)
If any of the aforementioned persons reside outside of the city but within the state, service shall be effected by causing a copy of the notice to be served upon such party or parties by the sheriff or any lawful deputy of the county of residence of such party, or such service may be made by any adult citizen, as to personal service or service by leaving a copy at such party's residence, shall be conclusive as to such service.
(3)
Nonresidents of this state shall be served by publishing the notice for two successive weeks in the legal organ of the county, and by posting a copy of such notice in a conspicuous place on premises affected by the notice. Where the address of such nonresidents is known, a copy of such notice shall be mailed to them by registered or certified mail.
(4)
In the event either the owner or any party in interest is a minor or an insane person or person laboring under disabilities, the guardian or other personal representative of such person shall be served, and if such guardian or personal representative resides outside the city or is a nonresident, he shall be served as provided above in such cases. If such minor or insane person or person laboring under disabilities has no guardian or personal representative or in the event such minor or insane person lives outside the city or is a nonresident, service shall be perfected by serving such minor or insane person personally or by leaving a copy at the place of his residence which shall be sufficient evidence as to the service of such person or persons. In the case of other persons who live outside of the city or are nonresidents, service shall be perfected by serving the judge of the probate court of the county, who shall stand in the place of and protect the rights of such minor or insane persons or appoint a guardian ad litem for such person.
(5)
In the event the whereabouts of any owner or party in interest is unknown and the whereabouts cannot be ascertained by the public officer in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the public officer shall make an affidavit of that effect, and the service of such notice upon such person shall be made in the same manner as provided in subsection (3) of this section, and service may be further perfected upon any person, firm or corporation holding itself out as an agent for the property involved.
(6)
A copy of such notice shall also be filed in the proper office or offices for the filing of lis pendens notice in the county, and such filing of the notice shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law. Any such notice or an appropriate lis pendens notice may contain a statement to the effect that a lien may arise against the described property maintained by the city.
(7)
The city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien only in the following manner:
a.
The owner or parties at interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying the city within 30 days after the perfection of such lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying to the city the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as prescribed in this subsection;
b.
Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties at interest at any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city at the time of the sale, transfer or conveyance; and
c.
Should the amount of such lien or any portion thereof, be unpaid after the passage of such three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subsection (7)b of this section, the city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for repair of dwellings, buildings or other structures in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358, and other applicable state statutes. This procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any persons having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property, all as provided by O.C.G.A. § 58-4-40 et seq.
