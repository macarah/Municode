ARTICLE IV. - HANDLERS

Sec. 4-305. - Permit required.
(a)
All employees involved in either the dispensing, serving or sale of alcoholic beverages are required to obtain a photo permit from the city police department.
(b)
Employees subject to this provision shall, within 14 days of their first day of work in an establishment holding a license to sell alcoholic beverages, report to the city police department for the purpose of applying for photo permit on such forms as shall be required by the police department. No person may remain employed by any establishment holding an alcoholic beverage license unless the provisions of these sections have been complied with.
(c)
Photo permits are transferable from one licensed premises to another within the corporate city limits. A photo permit shall be valid for a period of two years from the date of issue. At expiration, a new photo permit must be applied for. Photo permits must be made available for inspection upon request by the governing body, police department or city code enforcement officer at any time. In case of lost, altered or mutilated photo permits, a replacement must be obtained immediately. If the original photo permit is found after a replacement is issued, then it must be turned in to the permits section at the police department; possession of more than one photo permit is a violation of this section.
(Ord. No. 2013-06, § 1(6-400), 11-11-2013)
Sec. 4-306. - Fees.
(a)
A processing fee is payable to the city upon application for a photo permit. In the event of a lost or mutilated photo permit, a replacement fee shall be payable to the city.
(b)
The processing fee is as established by the city and amendable by resolution and is payable at the time of application for the permit.
(Ord. No. 2013-06, § 1(6-401), 11-11-2013)
Sec. 4-307. - Background checks.
(a)
The city shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any police record of the person applying for the photo permit. The cost of the background check shall be paid by the applicant in addition to the processing fee. No photo permit shall be issued to any person if the following is shown to exist:
(1)
That the employee as a previous or current employee, or as a previous alcoholic beverage licensee, has been convicted of violating any laws, ordinances, or regulations regulating such business if such conviction or arrest occurred within a five-year-period immediately preceding the date of application. If there are pending charges alleging violations of such laws and ordinances or regulations, then action shall be postponed until the charges are adjudicated;
(2)
That the employee within a five-year-period preceding the date of application shall have been convicted for any felony charged under any of the laws of the several states or of the United States. If there are pending charges alleging violation of a felony, then action shall be postponed until the charges are adjudicated;
(3)
That the employee has been convicted of more than one misdemeanor, including traffic violations, involving the use or abuse of any alcoholic beverage, opiate or drug, within the three years preceding the application. If there are pending charges alleging violation of such misdemeanor, then action shall be postponed until the charges are adjudicated provided that conviction of the charge would disqualify the applicant from receiving the photo permit;
(4)
That the employee is on parole or probation unless the applicant provides sufficient proof that the employee will not violate the terms of such parole or probation by the employment in an establishment serving alcohol; or
(5)
That the employee has any outstanding arrest warrants for whom no service has been perfected.
In the event there is a criminal record discovered that would exclude the issuance of a photo permit, the designated agent of the police department shall issue a letter to the person fingerprinted, to the city clerk, and to the employer, stating that the person is ineligible for employment.
(b)
Any employee excluded from receiving or holding a photo permit under the terms of this section shall have the right to appeal such exclusion to the governing body, which may in its discretion approve the issuance of a photo permit.
(c)
The failure of an employee to get a photo permit will not prohibit the employee from applying for and receiving one if all other conditions of this section are otherwise met. However, failure to present a valid permit upon request/check by a city official, shall be a violation of this chapter and shall subject the violator to a city ordinance violation to be adjudicated in the municipal court.
