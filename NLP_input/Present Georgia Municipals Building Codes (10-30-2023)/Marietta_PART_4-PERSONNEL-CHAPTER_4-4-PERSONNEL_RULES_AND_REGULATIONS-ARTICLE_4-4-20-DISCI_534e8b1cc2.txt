ARTICLE 4-4-20 - DISCIPLINARY ACTION POLICY AND PROCEDURE

4-4-20-010 - Goal and purpose.
A.
The goal of the city/BLW is to provide quality public services to the citizens and customers of the city/BLW. The establishment and maintenance of a cooperative and goal oriented work atmosphere is a responsibility of all employees and will go a long way toward eliminating serious disciplinary problems. If, however, disciplinary problems do arise, supervisors and department heads should make every effort to ensure that employees have a thorough understanding of city/BLW policies and an awareness of what is expected in job behavior and performance.
B.
The purpose of this policy is to provide a means to encourage employees to change their behavior through disciplinary action. The application of these guidelines must be consistent and equitable among all employees and departments so that employees receive like treatment for similar offenses.

4-4-20-030 - Procedure.
A.
The procedure listed below is intended to assist supervisors and department heads in determining a proper course of action when discipline is needed. Any employee who violates any of the established personnel policies, a directives or operational, safety or departmental rules shall be disciplined depending on the severity and/or frequency of the violation.
B.
Severity can generally be interpreted in the following manner:
1.
Minor. Not a threat to the safety or well-being of persons (employees, citizens, customers), property or the organization.
2.
Serious. A threat to the safety or well-being of persons (employees, citizens, customers), property or the organization.
3.
Major. Matters that cannot be tolerated. (Example: Fighting on the job; sale of illegal drugs, etc.).
C.
The city/BLW will utilize a corrective or progressive system of discipline to encourage employees to change their behavior in matters that can be described a "minor" in severity level. However, matters described as "serious" or "major" will be handled on a case by case basis.
D.
Supervisory staff has the right and responsibility to correct employee behavior by recommending disciplinary action. The department head and/or their designee, subject to the appeal rights of regular employees, shall have the following alternatives for taking disciplinary action, again depending upon the severity and/or frequency of the incident or like occurrences:
1.
Verbal Reprimand. An employee may be called in for private counseling by his supervisor, division manager or department head regarding unacceptable behavioral patterns or work performance standards. The department head or designee should record the giving of such verbal reprimand by documenting on a notice of counseling form which shall indicate the date of the counseling session, subject matter, and remedial action to be taken and timeframe, if any. The employee should, but is not required to acknowledge receipt of the notice of counseling form by their signature. Signing of the notice of counseling form does not indicate agreement with the action taken and failure to sign does not negate the disciplinary action. The notice of counseling is a departmental record and does not need to be sent to the human resources department unless it is to support subsequent disciplinary action(s). Verbal reprimands can be neither grieved nor appealed.
2.
Written Reprimand. A written reprimand may be given to an employee by his department head or specified designee when:
a.
A verbal reprimand has not resulted in the desired improvement; or
b.
When the initial actions required greater discipline than a verbal warning.
An employee should, but is not required to, acknowledge receipt of all written disciplinary actions by their signature. Signing of the disciplinary action form does not indicate agreement with the action taken and failure to sign does not negate the disciplinary action. A copy of notice of written reprimand shall be filed in the employee's personnel file in the human resources department. All supporting documentation should be attached to the disciplinary action form. Written reprimands can be neither grieved nor appealed. However, the employee has the right to: a) discuss the written reprimand with the department head or specified designee and/or b) submit a written statement to be attached to the written reprimand and with any copy of such reprimand.
3.
Suspension Without Pay. Prior to a final decision regarding a suspension without pay, a regular status employee (who has successfully completed his work test period) will be given a hearing before the department head. Written notice of that hearing will be submitted to the employee by the department head or their designee at least 24 hours before the time of the hearing. Notice shall be hand delivered to the employee or personally delivered to the employee's home, leaving it with the employee or with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein. If the employee cannot, after due diligence, be located, notice shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will specifically state the alleged grounds for which the suspension without pay is being considered, including a summary of the incident(s) from which the proposed disciplinary action arose. The employee will then have an opportunity at the hearing to explain, rebut or otherwise respond to the information upon which the proposed action is being taken.
A department head may suspend an employee without pay for up to 56 hours for fire personnel and 40 hours for all other personnel. A department head may suspend an employee without pay for periods exceeding 56 hours for fire personnel and 40 hours for all other personnel up to a maximum of 112 hours for fire personnel and 80 hours for all other personnel after informing the city manager and human resources director of the proposed disciplinary action. Failure to inform the city manager and human resources director shall not invalidate such disciplinary action.
4.
Administrative Leave With Pay. During the investigation, hearing, or trial of an employee on a criminal charge or during the course of a civil action involving an employee, when allowing the employee to continue to perform his regular duties would be, in the opinion of the department head and the human resources director, detrimental to the city's legitimate interests, the department head may authorize administrative leave with pay of the employee for the duration of the proceedings as a nondisciplinary action. The department head may also authorize administrative leave with pay for non-disciplinary reasons pending investigation by the city of a suspected disciplinary infraction.
5.
Demotion. Prior to a final decision to demote an employee, a regular status employee (who has successfully completed his work test period) will be given a hearing before the department head. Written notice of that hearing will be submitted to the employee by the department head or their designee at least 24 hours before the time of the hearing. Notice shall be hand delivered to the employee or personally delivered to the employee's home, leaving it with the employee or with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein. If the employee cannot, after due diligence, be located, notice shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will specifically state the alleged grounds for which the demotion is being considered, including a summary of the incident(s) from which the proposed disciplinary action arose. The employee will then have an opportunity at the hearing to explain, rebut or otherwise respond to the information upon which the proposed action is being taken.
An employee who is unsatisfactory in his present position may be demoted for disciplinary reasons if, in the opinion of his department head or specified designee, he shows reasonable promise of becoming a satisfactory employee in another position. An employee who is demoted for disciplinary reasons shall be relieved of his present duties and responsibilities and assigned new duties and responsibilities which are less difficult and demanding and which will provide the employee a lower salary. This option is only available if a lower level authorized position is vacant or is created by the authorization of the city manager to downgrade an authorized position.
6.
Transfers that involve no reduction in salary or benefits do not constitute a demotion and can neither be grieved nor appealed, even if the transfer involves a change of duties, responsibilities and authority.
7.
Dismissal.
a.
A department head may dismiss an employee for cause after informing the city manager and human resources director of the proposed disciplinary action. Failure to inform the city manager and human resources director shall not invalidate the dismissal. The human resources director shall serve as expert advisor to the department head regarding all dismissal actions. Prior to a final decision regarding dismissal, a regular status employee (who has successfully completed his work test period) will be given a hearing before the department head. Written notice of that hearing will be submitted to the employee by the department head or their designee at least 24 hours before the time of the hearing. Notice shall be hand delivered to the employee or personally delivered to the employee's home, leaving it with the employee or with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein. If the employee cannot, after due diligence, be located, notice shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will specifically state the alleged grounds for which termination is being considered, including a summary of the incident(s) from which the proposed dismissal action arose. The employee will then have an opportunity at the hearing to explain, rebut or otherwise respond to the information upon which the proposed action is being taken.
b.
If discharge action is taken subsequent to the departmental hearing, the employee shall be furnished notice of the discharge in writing stating the reasons and his rights to appeal the dismissal, if applicable. The notice and attachments become a permanent record unless modified by appeal action.
c.
Employees classified, as department heads who are employed in that capacity after February 9, 1994 are at-will employees of the city/BLW. However, any police chief and fire chief are exempted from these provisions and will be hired and may be terminated in compliance with the City Charter Section 4-12-1. Any other such department head may be discharged at any time within the discretion of the city manager, with or without cause. Prior to discharging a department head without cause or for cause deemed by the city manager to be beyond the department heads control as defined below, the city manager shall advise the city council in executive session of this intent; provided, that his omission to do so shall not affect the effectiveness of the discharge.
d.
Upon his discharge, a department head hired after February 9, 1994, may be eligible for severance benefits as follows: (1) severance pay equal to an amount up to four times his most recent gross weekly salary, the amount of which is dependent upon whether or not such executive finds other employment within four weeks after the effective date of the discharge; and (2) continued participation in the city/BLW health insurance program at full predischarge levels at the expense of the city/BLW for a period up to four weeks from the date of separation, or until covered by another health insurance program, whichever occurs first. To qualify for these severance benefits, an otherwise eligible executive, as defined below, shall, in writing and in a form approved by the city attorney, release the city/BLW and its elected and appointed officials, officers and employees in both their official capacity and personally, from any and all claims relating to his employment or the termination thereof, and shall likewise relinquish rights to a grievance/appeal hearing as provided herein.
e.
Only a department head hired after February 9, 1994, is eligible for the above described severance benefits if and only if he is discharged without cause or for cause deemed by the city manager within his discretion to be beyond the department head's control (for exampleโreductions in force; elimination of a department; inability to perform job requirements at acceptable levels despite consistent demonstrable attempts to do so, etc.). Additionally, an eligible department head, upon being notified by the city manager that discharge is imminent, may choose instead to resign his employment voluntarily without loss of eligibility for severance benefits. A department head hired after February 9, 1994, who is discharged for cause as set forth in subparagraphs 1. through 24. of Section 4-4-20-040 of this chapter or other provisions of these rules and regulations or for any cause deemed by the city manager within his discretion to be contrary to the interests of the city/BLW shall not be eligible for severance benefits.
E.
At each level up to discharge action, employees will be warned that failure to correct their behavior, will result in specific, more severe disciplinary action.
F.
Notification of Disciplinary Suspension, Demotion or Dismissal. When an employee is suspended, demoted or dismissed by his department head, the department head shall immediately provide the employee with written notice of the action taken, the effective date, the reasons for the action and the recourse available to the employee under the provisions of these rules and regulations. A copy of such notice shall be furnished to the human resources director with copies of all supporting documentation.
