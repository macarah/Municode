The chairperson of the board of commissioners, as presiding officer, is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting.

The chairperson shall be impartial and conduct the meetings in a fair manner.
(b)
The chairperson has exactly the same rights and privileges as all other members have, including the right to make motions, speak in debate and to vote on all questions. However, the impartiality required of the presiding officer of an assembly (especially a large one) precludes exercising the right to make motions or debate while presiding, and also requires refraining from voting except when the vote is by ballot, or whenever his vote will affect the result.
(c)
On a vote which is not by ballot, if a majority vote is required and there is a tie, the chairperson may vote in the affirmative to cause the motion to prevail. If there is one more in the affirmative than in the negative, he can create a tie by voting in the negative to cause the motion to fail. Similarly, if a two-thirds vote is required, he may vote either to cause, or to block, attainment of the necessary two thirds. (RONR (10th ed.), p. 392-93; see also Table A, p. 190 of RONR In Brief.)

Sec. 2-219. - Suspending the rules of order.
Rules of order may be suspended. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable, and requires an affirmative vote of the majority of the quorum. Rules governing quorums (section 2-213), voting methods and requirements (sections 2-226 and 2-227), the notification to commissioners of meetings (section 2-220) and rules necessary for compliance with state law may not be suspended; provided, however, that, in the event that a state of emergency is declared by the governor or other authorized state official, the board may waive time-consuming procedures and formalities imposed by state law.
