ARTICLE IV. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 64-258. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage;
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(6)
Adopt and comply with the requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 USC 4003 et seq.) and sections 60.2(h), 60.3(d) and 65.5 of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 9.4 et seq.) thereby ensuring that the unincorporated areas of Fulton County and its citizens shall continue to participate in the benefits of the program and not be subject to the prohibitions contained in section 202(a) of the 1973 act as amended.
Sec. 64-259. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding, generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
(7)
Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
Sec. 64-260. - Jurisdiction.
This article shall apply to all the unincorporated areas of Fulton County which contain special flood hazard or floodprone areas.
Sec. 64-261. - Flood areas established.
(a)
Special flood hazard area shall be designated on the "Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps" (FBFM), the "Flood Insurance Rate Maps" (FIRM), and the "Flood Insurance Study" (FIS) prepared and revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), effective June 22, 1998. As defined by FEMA, special flood hazard areas (SFHA) are classified as numbered or unnumbered zones A, AE, (formerly A1-A30), AO, and AH which are available for review on maps in the community development department or the department of public works. The accompanying maps and other supporting data and all subsequent amendments and revisions are hereby adopted by reference, declared to be a part of this zoning ordinance, and shall have the same force and effect as if fully set forth in this zoning ordinance. SFHA shall be identified as follows:
(1)
Fifty lots or five acres or more. When FEMA has not produced water surface elevations data and the proposed development is more than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, the base flood elevation data determined in studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other reputable reports based on competent engineering studies prepared by a current state-registered professional engineer and accepted by the department of public works shall be adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article.
(2)
Fewer than 50 lots or five acres. When FEMA has not produced water surface elevation data and the proposed development is not fewer than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, then the base flood elevation data may be determined by the best information available.
(b)
Regulatory floodway area shall be designated on the "Flood Boundary and Floodway Map" and the "Flood Insurance Study" as revised by FEMA from time to time. It is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
(c)
Floodprone area shall be designated on the "Flood Insurance Rate Map." Floodprone areas shall be those areas classified as areas of moderate and minimal flood hazards, shown thereon as "Zone X" (formerly zone B).
Sec. 64-262. - Use regulations.
(a)
Notwithstanding the uses permitted by the zoning district applying to the property, the following shall be prohibited in the special flood hazard area (100-year intermediate regional flood (IRF)):
(1)
Buildings and structures;
(2)
Filling; and
(3)
Compensatory flood storage for placement of either fill or for construction of a structure in the floodplain with exception to exempted uses as specified in subsection (c) of this section.
(b)
Floodplain designation shall be based on data generated by FEMA, Fulton County flood studies, or data from engineering flood studies prepared by a state-registered professional engineer and accepted by the city (whichever is most representative of the current floodplain). Flood studies shall be approved contingent upon acceptance by FEMA.
(c)
Construction, which is consistent with the exemption provisions of this zoning ordinance, shall be allowed within floodways only if it is directed towards improving the capacity or flow characteristics of the floodwaters or crossing, relocating or altering the floodway channel itself. All such construction must be in conformance with the provisions of the city zoning ordinance and the National Flood Insurance Program.
(1)
Special flood hazard/floodprone permitted uses. The following uses are permitted in special flood hazard and floodprone areas:
a.
Agricultural, including forestry and livestock raising, requiring no structure. Agriculture and forestry access roads are permitted provided they are constructed in conformance with the development standards of the regulations.
b.
Dams; provided that they are constructed in accordance with the requirement of this section, the department of public works, the USDA Soil and Conservation Service, and when applicable, meet the specifications of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state department of natural resources.
c.
Fences having sufficient open area to permit the free flow of water or debris.
d.
Identification, regulatory and warning signs.
e.
Public and private parks and recreational areas including boat ramps and docks and other functionally dependent uses not including any temporary or permanent buildings; provided such use is approved by the community development department, if applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
f.
Parking.
g.
Utility lines, pipelines, sewers, roads and stream crossings (if no other means of access is available), and similar facilities; provided they are constructed in such a manner as to permit the free flow of floodwaters.
(2)
Floodway area permitted uses. No construction is allowed within floodways except that which is directed towards improving the capacity or flow characteristics of the floodwaters or crossing, relocating or altering the floodway channel itself. All such construction must be in conformance with the provisions of this zoning ordinance and the National Flood Insurance Program.
Secs. 64-263â€”64-281. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - PERMITS

Sec. 64-282. - Required.
A land disturbance permit or grading permit shall be required prior to the commencement of any improvement, including grading and filling, within the special flood hazard or floodprone areas.
(1)
Activities on lots within existing development. In developments that require only a building permit on a developed lot, portions of which are subject to flooding, the director of the community development department shall review the application and issue the permit as part of the building permit. The flood elevation study as required by section 64-261(a)(1) may be waived by the department of public works; provided:
a.
A licensed surveyor submits base flood elevation data based on the best information available.
b.
That the base flood elevation data is to be used only to establish the lowest floor elevation of a structure.
(2)
Activities requiring land disturbance permit. In developments that require a land disturbance permit as provided in the "Erosion and Sedimentation Ordinance of 1978," the community development department shall review the application and issue the permit as part of the land disturbance permit.
(3)
Other activities. In all other developments that involve change, modification, or alteration to a flood area, except such activities as plowing, tilling, seeding, planting, or any other agricultural or landscaping pursuit which does not result in change to the cross sectional area of the floodplain nor a significant or hazardous change in the flow characteristics, the developer shall be required to obtain the applicable permit prior to the commencement of any construction within the floodplain.
Sec. 64-283. - Procedure.
(a)
Application. An application for a permit shall be made to the community development department as indicated under permit required in section 64-282. If the proposed development requires a land disturbance permit or is of such a nature as to require review and approval by the community development department, or any other appropriate agencies, the applicant shall be so advised. Such review may require additional data and/or plans to be furnished by the applicant to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.
(b)
Certification. The director of the community development department shall inform an applicant of the requirements that as-built lowest floor elevation certificates be obtained prior to approval of a certificate of occupancy for any structure built in or immediately adjacent to a special flood hazard area. Certificates of elevation shall be:

(f)
Removing flood hazard or floodprone areas. Lands may be removed from a special flood hazard area or floodprone area by raising the elevation of such land above the base flood elevation; provided the raising of such land is accomplished in accordance with the requirements of this zoning ordinance. Refer to FEMA National Flood Insurance Program Regulation (44 CFR 65) for procedures to amend the FIRM, FHBM, or FIS. The developer/property owner shall prepare all plans and engineering studies and pay any fees necessary to obtain a letter of map revision for their development.
(g)
Residential lots. In districts which permit residential use, development is prohibited in special flood hazard areas. The city may allow such development; provided:
(1)
Not less than 70 percent of the buildable land area lies above the base flood elevation, a minimum of one foot; or
(2)
Not less than 50 percent of the minimum lot area, as established by the applicable zoning district, shall be above the base flood elevation.
(h)
Utilities. The location, design, elevation, and construction of all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, on-site waste disposal systems, water systems and streets shall be in such a manner as to minimize or eliminate damage by flooding.
(i)
Drainage structures. All drainage structures and facilities located within special flood hazard or floodprone areas shall be constructed in accordance with the city standards and specifications. They shall be maintained by the owner in a sanitary, fully functional and operable state so that the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse is preserved.
(j)
Erosion and sediment control. Provision shall be made for the adequate control of erosion and sedimentation.
(k)
Riverine considerations. The city shall notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the Georgia State Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.
(l)
Watercourse alteration or relocation. The city, prior to approval of a permit to alter or relocate a portion of any watercourse, shall require an agreement indemnifying the city from all liability arising from the construction pursuant to said permit and providing for the continued maintenance to ensure the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated watercourse.
Sec. 64-305. - Development within floodprone areas.
(a)
Development limitations. Within floodprone areas, no construction including grading and filling shall be allowed that would:
(1)
Raise the base flood elevation beyond the boundaries of the ownership of the property being developed. Submittal of this certification and the supporting studies by a professional engineer are required.
(2)
Reduce the flood storage capacity. Fill placed within the floodplain must be compensated. All cut areas must drain by gravity to the main watercourse. Certification by a professional engineer and an "as-built" topographical map superimposed on the original topography are required.
(3)
Impede the movement of floodwaters. Applies to any obstruction placed within the floodplain (i.e., fill, but in particular, roads, driveways, bridges and culverts). All such encroachments shall be designed and submitted by a professional engineer and shall provide:
a.
That there shall be no reduction in the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse.
b.
A certification together with supportive data.
c.
Sufficient opening provided for the passage of the floodwaters so as to prevent or greatly reduce the hazard of debris or trash blocking the flood's flow.
(4)
Change the flow characteristics of the floodwaters as they pass the boundaries of the developed property. Requires certification by a professional engineer along with all supportive studies.
(5)
Create hazardous or erosion-producing velocities. Requires certification by a professional engineer along with supportive studies.
(b)
Stormwater management structures. Detention ponds, lakes and similar impoundment structures may be constructed within a floodprone area provided they do not violate the restrictions enumerated under subsection (a) of this section. Provided further that any such detention pond, lake or similar impoundment structure shall provide adequate discharge control and sufficient storage capacity to ensure that the rate of runoff calculated for the proposed development including that drainage increased or diverted by reason of the development shall not exceed that calculated for the property in its natural state in the event of the 100-year storm.
(c)
Studies and plans required. A hydrologic analysis shall be required to be submitted to the community development department with each application for a land disturbance permit for property containing a floodprone area. Any or all of the other plans or studies referred to in section 64-303 may be required. Such studies shall take cognizance of existing conditions which affect the flow of water on adjacent properties and also such future conditions as can reasonably be expected to occur in the drainage basin. Such reports shall meet the requirements of the community development department.
(d)
Revision criteria. Each application for a land disturbance permit for property containing a floodprone area shall also submit therewith documented results of hydrology and hydraulic analysis prepared by a registered professional engineer demonstrating that any area defined on the FIRM or FBFM as moderate or minimal flood hazard (Zone X) is not actually an SHFA. Such results and analysis shall demonstrate that none of the following criteria is met in any floodprone area on the site:
(1)
The floodprone area is subject to a one percent annual chance of flooding with average channel depths greater than one foot;
(2)
The floodprone area has a contributing drainage area greater than one square mile; or;
(3)
The floodprone area has hazardous velocities in the channel and overbank areas greater than 3Â½ feet per second. (The city may accept velocities of up to five feet per second depending upon the results of a soil study by the engineer.)
In the event that any of the criteria mentioned in this section is met, the applicant shall submit to the community development department the relevant data for a letter of map revision and the appropriate fees required by FEMA. The city department of public works shall then submit the relevant data, letter of map revision and accompanying fees to FEMA for a determination of whether a map revision is warranted. In the event of such a map revision reclassifying an area as an SHFA, development within the affected areas shall comply with section 64-307.
Sec. 64-306. - Development with unstudied special flood hazard areas.
Development and revision criteria in the unstudied special hazard areas shall be the same as in the floodprone areas as set forth in section 64-305.
Sec. 64-307. - Development within studied special flood hazard areas.
(a)
Development limitations. No construction shall be allowed within the studied special flood hazard areas that would:
(1)
Raise the base flood elevation. Submittal of this certification and the supporting studies by a professional engineer are required.
(2)
Reduce the flood storage capacity. Fill placed within the floodplain must be compensated. All cut areas must drain by gravity to the main watercourse. Certification by a professional engineer and an "as-built" topography map superimposed on the original topography are required.
(3)
Impede the movement of floodwaters. Applies to any obstruction placed within the floodplain but in particular, roads, bridges, driveways and culverts. All such encroachments shall be designed by a professional engineer and shall provide:
a.
That there shall be no reduction in the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse.
b.
A certification together with supportive data.
c.
Sufficient opening provided for the passage of the floodwaters so as to prevent or greatly reduce the hazard of debris or trash blocking the flow of the flood.
(4)
Change the flow characteristics of the floodwaters. Requires certification by a professional engineer along with all supportive studies.
(5)
Create hazardous or erosion-producing velocities. Requires certification by a professional engineer along with supportive studies.
(b)
Increase base flood elevation. The department of public works may from time to time request a review and determination from the floodplain management administrator to permit an increase in the base flood elevation. Such increased elevation shall not exceed that depth shown in the flood insurance study.
(1)
This increase may be granted when:
a.
The development is a proposed public road, bridge or culvert, public utility poles, towers, pipelines, sewers and similar facilities.
b.
The development is a private lot, bridge/culvert, private utility poles, towers, pipelines, sewers or other similar facilities.
(2)
A professional engineer must submit a certification along with supportive documentation that the increase does not extend beyond the boundaries of the property upon which the improvement is proposed and shall not cause any appreciable expansion of flooding, siltation, erosion or inundation hazards.
(3)
A developer shall apply to the city floodplain management administrator for review and approval of an application for a letter of map revision to FEMA.
(4)
The floodplain management administrator may apply for a conditional FIRM revision to FEMA prior to permitting encroachment into a special flood hazard area. Refer to the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations 44 CFR 65.12 for FEMA requirements.
Sec. 64-308. - Floodway alteration.
When construction is proposed within the regulatory floodway such as flood control projects, stream channelization, stream relocation, construction of new dams, reservoirs, artificial canals, private levees or flood protection systems which would result in a change in the base flood elevations as shown on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), the following shall be required:
(1)
Complete plans, data, studies and documentation for the proposed construction shall be submitted to the department of public works.
(2)
If the department of public works determines that the project is feasible and acceptable, then the department shall submit the project to FEMA in compliance with the provisions of the National Flood Insurance Program, section 65.5 as amended from time to time.
Noteâ€” The city may require a fee for review of such proposals.
