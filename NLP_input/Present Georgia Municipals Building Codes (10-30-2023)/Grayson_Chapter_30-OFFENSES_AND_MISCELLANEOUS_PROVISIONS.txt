(Ord. of 12-20-1990)
Sec. 30-2. - Graffiti.
(a)
Definitions.
(1)
Graffiti shall mean any inscriptions, words, figures, paintings, or other defacements that are written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any public or private buildings, structures, places or property without prior authorization, in accordance with all ordinances of the city, by means of any aerosol paint container, broad-tipped marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching equipment, brush, chalk, dye, or other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark.
(2)
Graffiti abatement shall mean the abatement procedure that identifies graffiti, issues notices to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures or removes such graffiti in absence of a response.
(3)
Gum label shall mean any substance consisting of a material such as, but not limited to, paper, fabric, cloth, plastic, vinyl and/or any other similar material, where the material also contains one or more surfaces containing a substance such as, but not limited to, any material commonly known as an adhesive or glue, which cannot be removed from the surface in an intact condition and with minimal efforts, including, but not limited to, decals, stickers, patches, stamps, or labels.
(4)
Paint stick shall mean any device which contains any substance, solid or liquid, including, but not limited to, any form of any substance commonly known as paint, stain, ink, chalk, way, epoxy, and/or any other similar substance which can be applied to any surface by such means as applying pressure to and/or contacting any surface in such a way as to leave any visible mark.
(5)
Private contractor shall mean any person with whom the city shall have contracted to remove graffiti.
(b)
Findings; nuisance. The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and is destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts quickly to require the removal of graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city and its residents. Further, the city finds that rapid or prompt removal (less than 72 hours) serves as a deterrent to future defacement and such defacement is less likely to reappear. The city finds that graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.
(c)
Graffiti prohibited. It shall be a violation of this section for any person to write, paint, draw, crave, scratch, erect, or place upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage, other structure, tree or other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing inscription, figure, or mark of the type which is commonly known or referred to as "graffiti." Any such "graffiti" shall be removed or eradicated within 72 hours of its first appearance.
(d)
Violation. A violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be punishable by fine, restitution, or other penalty as the city's code enforcement board deems just and reasonable.
(e)
Notice to remove.
(1)
Whenever the city's code enforcement officer or his designee determines that graffiti exists on any private property which is visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk, or other right of way or any public park or property, the code enforcement officer shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall be given three days from the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city.
(2)
The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be a written notice and shall be served upon the owner(s) of the affected property, as such owner(s) name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of Gwinnett County, Georgia. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent to the property address. The notice may be served in any of the following manners:
a.
By personal service on the owner, occupant or manager of the property;
b.
By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner; or
c.
By posting a copy on the property.
(f)
Removal by city; lien. Upon failure of the owner(s) to comply with the notice to remove, the code enforcement officer shall issue a notice to appear before the code enforcement board. The code enforcement board shall be permitted to allow the city or a private contractor to remove the graffiti and charge any costs associated with removal to the owner of the property. The code enforcement board shall not be limited to removal by the city or a private contractor and may allow any fines, restitution or other penalty to become a lien against the property.

Sec. 30-81. - Utility right-of-way encroachment aesthetic standards.
(a)
Authority and scope.
(1)
O.C.G.A. § 32-4-92(a)(10) authorizes the city to establish reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, renewal, removal, and relocation of pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, poles, towers, traffic and other signals, and other equipment, facilities, or appliances in, on, along, over, or under the public roads of the city. Further, 47 U.S.C. § 253(c) provides that the city has authority to manage its public rights-of-way.
(2)
The city finds it is in the best interest of the city and its residents and businesses to establish aesthetic requirements and other specifications and reasonable conditions regarding placement of facilities in the public rights-of-way. These requirements, specifications and conditions are adopted in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents and businesses of the city and to reasonably manage and protect the public rights-of-way and its uses in the city.
(3)
The objective of this article is to ensure use of the public rights-of-way: (i) is consistent with the design, appearance and other features of nearby land uses; (ii) protects the integrity of historic, cultural and scenic resources; and (iii) does not harm residents' quality of life.

Any individual requesting to locate facilities above ground in areas where electric lines/utilities are underground (residential subdivisions, etc.) has the burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that undergrounding will effectively prohibit the provision of the service in question.
(1)
Light poles and small wireless facilities collocated thereon may be located above ground in areas of the city where facilities are primarily located underground.
(2)
The city may: (i) allow collocated small wireless facilities placed aboveground prior to the effective date of this Code and subject to any applicable pole attachment agreement to remain above ground; or (ii) allow the wireless provider to replace the pole associated with previously collocated small wireless facilities at the same location or propose an alternate location within 50 feet of the prior location, which the wireless provider shall use unless such alternate location imposes technical limits or significant additional costs.
(f)
Camouflaging. Facilities must be designed using camouflaging techniques that make them as unobtrusive as possible if:
(1)
It is not possible or desirable to match the design and color of facilities with the similar facilities in the same zoning area, as required under subsection d(1); or
(2)
Existing facilities in the area are out of character with a streetscape plan or other aesthetic plan that has been adopted by the city.
(g)
Concealment. Facilities shall incorporate specific concealment elements to minimize visual impacts.
(h)
Preferred locations.
(1)
Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, facilities shall, to the extent that is it reasonable, be placed in the following areas of the city (i) industrial; (ii) commercial; (iii) residential. These areas are identified in terms of priority, meaning industrial is the most preferred location, followed by commercial, etc.
(2)
Facilities may be located outside areas identified in subsection (h)(1) if: (i) facilities must be placed outside of the areas identified in subsection (h)(1) in order to maintain existing services, improve services, or new service can only be provided if facilities are placed in areas located outside of those identified in subsection (h)(1); or (ii) the proposed facilities will meet all applicable requirements for the non-preferred location and will complement the character of the zoning area.
(i)
Installation and modification standards. Installation of new facilities in, on, along, over, or under the public rights-of-way or modification of existing facilities in, on, along, over, or under the public rights-of-way shall:

Ensure that installations and modifications are subject to periodic review to minimize the intrusion on the right-of-way;
(3)
Ensure that the city bears no risk or liability as a result of the installations or modifications; and

Ensure that use of the public rights-of-way does not inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of the public rights-of-way, or hinder the ability of the city or other government entities to improve, modify, relocate, abandon, or vacate the right-of-way or any portion thereof, or to cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation, or abandonment of facilities in the right-of-way.
(j)
Plans for use. No facilities shall be placed in, on, along, over, or under the public rights-of-way unless: (i) there are immediate plans to use the proposed facility; or (ii) there is a contract with another party that has immediate plans to use the proposed facility.
