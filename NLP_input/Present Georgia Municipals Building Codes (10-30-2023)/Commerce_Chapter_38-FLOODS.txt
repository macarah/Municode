DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 38-26. - Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of the City of Commerce.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-27. - Findings.
The flood hazard areas in the City of Commerce, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-28. - Purposes.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-29. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
Insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure: A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
Subdivision: The division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed.
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the administrator, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions: Where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance: A grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Areas of special flood hazard established in this article may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of this article for "elevated buildings." The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus two feet, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in this article.
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-61. - Subdivisions.
(a)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(c)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(d)
For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-62. - Standards for critical facilities.
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.

DIVISION 4. - VARIANCES

Sec. 38-81. - Variance procedures.
The Commerce City Council, after recommendation from the planning commission, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article.
The Commerce City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the zoning administrator, in the enforcement or administration of this article.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Commerce City Council with jurisdiction may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Jackson County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1 et seq.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-82. - Criteria and conditions for variances.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. In reviewing requests for variances, the Commerce City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and the following standards in addition to others in this article. A variance shall be issued only when consistent with the following criteria and conditions:
(1)
A finding of good and sufficient cause is made.
(2)
A determination is made that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship.
(3)
A determination is made that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(4)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(5)
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(6)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. In the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(7)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-83. - Conditional approval permitted.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Commerce City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
(Ord. No. 2010-009, § 1, 6-14-10)
Sec. 38-84. - Actions following variance approval.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
