ARTICLE X. - RESIDENTIAL, SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT, R-1

Section 1000. - Purpose and intent.
Within White County are areas that have been subdivided, or can be subdivided, for residential development in a variety of development settings based on the carrying capacity of the land and the infrastructure available in the area. These areas range from being rural in character to more suburban settings. It is the intent of the Residential Single-Family District to provide suitable areas where the development of residential subdivision has occurred or is taking place. Furthermore, the White County Comprehensive Plan supports the maintenance of the rural character of the county and recommends the application [of] extremely low density restrictions to discourage the subdivision of land in these areas. These parts of the county are those that lie within agricultural areas and may also display traditional historic elements within the fabric of the community setting. The White County Comprehensive Plan also recognizes the need for establishing residential areas where public infrastructure and related services are available, or in close proximity, are adjacent to compatible uses and can be developed in an economically efficient manner.
These areas are intended to establish and preserve quiet, stable and affordable single-family neighborhoods at low to medium densities, free from other land uses, except those which are compatible with and convenient to the residents of such district. It is also the intent to recognize the need for conservation and open space as densities increase and allow for open spaces and conservation areas to be set aside for the benefit of the community, developer and all future generations who live in White County.
