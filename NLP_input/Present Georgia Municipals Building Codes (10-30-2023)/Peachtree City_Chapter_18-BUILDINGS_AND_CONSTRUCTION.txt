Sec. 18-376. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to ensure that residents and businesses in the City of Peachtree City (city) have access to wireless telecommunications networks and state-of-the-art communications services while also ensuring that this objective is achieved in a fashion that considers public safety, preserves the aesthetic character of the community, and is accomplished according to city zoning, planning, and design standards.
The standards contained in this article are intended to comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 as amended, Section 6409 of the "Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act" (Spectrum Act) of 2012, as well as O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 66C known as the "Streamlining Wireless Facilities and Antennas Act" of 2019 and the Federal Communications Commission 2018 Report and Order FCC-18-133 known as the "FCC Small Cell Order." The Telecommunications Act of 1996 preserved, with certain limitations, local government land use and zoning authority concerning the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The city recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the city and a significant benefit to its residents. The provisions of this article are not intended and shall not be interpreted to have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services. This article shall not be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. In reviewing any application to provide personal wireless service or to install personal wireless service facilities, the city shall act within the time periods described by this article while taking into account the nature and scope of the application and the required notice and review process where applicable. Any decision to deny an application shall be in writing, supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
To accomplish the above-stated objectives and to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities complies with all applicable federal and state laws, and is consistent with the city's land use and zoning policies, the city is adopting comprehensive regulations pertaining to wireless telecommunications facilities.
These regulations are designed to meet the following:
(1)
Promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public by regulating the siting of and establishing development standards for wireless telecommunications facilities and related equipment;
(2)
Encourage the location of wireless telecommunications facilities within non-residential areas while protecting residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers;
(3)
Encourage collocation and site sharing of new and existing wireless telecommunications facilities;
(4)
Facilitate the use of public property for wireless telecommunications facilities;
(5)
Locate wireless telecommunications facilities in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized;
(6)
Encourage design and construction of wireless telecommunications facilities to harmonize the visual impact of the wireless telecommunications facilities with the existing natural and/or built environment;
(7)
Enhance the ability of the providers of personal wireless services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
(8)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure with engineering and careful siting of tower structures;
(9)
Enhance and provide emergency respondent capabilities;
(10)
To establish procedural requirements and substantive criteria applicable to review and approval or denial of applications for a proposed modification to wireless telecommunications facilities;
(11)
To ensure that application submittal requirements are related to information reasonably necessary to determine if the proposed modification will result in a substantial change in the physical dimensions of the wireless telecommunications facility support structure;
(12)
To preserve the city's right to continue to enforce and condition approvals in this article in compliance with generally applicable building, structural, electrical, and safety codes and with other laws codifying objective standards reasonably related to health and safety;
(13)
To promote timely decisions under this article; and
(14)
To ensure that decisions are made consistently and predictably.
