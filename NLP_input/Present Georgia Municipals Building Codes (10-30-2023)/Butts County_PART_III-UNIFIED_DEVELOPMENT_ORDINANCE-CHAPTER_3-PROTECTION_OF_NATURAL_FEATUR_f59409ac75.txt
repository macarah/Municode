Sec. 3.06.02. - Establishment of the Wetlands Protection District.
The Wetlands Protection (WP) District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Butts County, Georgia, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Map. This map shall be referred to as the Generalized Wetlands Map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
The Generalized Wetlands Map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Butts County and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
