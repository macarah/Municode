The proper operation of democratic government required that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that the government decisions and policy be made through proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all county officials and employees is adopted. The purpose of this policy is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the county and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the county.

ARTICLE III. - SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY

Sec. 12-31. - Policy established.
Whitfield County is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when any county employee illegally uses drugs on the job, comes to work under their influence, possesses, distributes or sells drugs in the workplace, or abuses alcohol on the job. This policy statement shall be posted on the courthouse bulletin board and other locations within each department and otherwise made available for inspection during normal working hours. The county has established the following policy:
(1)
It is a violation of county policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in illegal use of drugs on the job.
(2)
It is a violation of county policy for anyone to report to work under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol.
(3)
The consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages on county premises and all work areas is prohibited. An employee whose normal faculties are impaired due to the consumption of alcohol, or whose blood alcohol level is 0.04 or higher while on duty or while conducting county business shall be guilty of misconduct. Failure to submit to required medical or physical examinations or tests is misconduct, and is grounds for discharge or suspension, without pay, from employment. Behavior that constitutes a refusal to submit to a test includes:
a.
A verbal declaration;
b.
An inability to provide a sufficient urine specimen or breath sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as obstructive behavior or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test;
c.
Leaving the scene of an accident without justifiable explanation prior to submission to drug and alcohol testing.
(4)
It is a violation of the county policy for anyone to use prescription drugs illegally. However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications.
(5)
All employees are required to notify the county of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within five days after such conviction. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
(Mo. of 7-12-94; Mo. of 10-8-96)
Sec. 12-32. - Determination of employee as impaired.
An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status. Next the supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse has occurred. If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, the employee will be sent to a medical facility by taxi or other safe transportation alternative, depending on the determination of the observed impairment, and accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary for the purposes of drug or alcohol testing. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive. Under no circumstances should an employee be sent home without first being tested.
(Mo. of 7-12-94; Mo. of 10-8-96)
Sec. 12-33. - Testing of job applicants.
All job applicants at Whitfield County will undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment. Any applicant with a confirmed positive test will be denied employment.
Applicants will be required to submit voluntarily to a urinalysis test at a laboratory chosen by the county, and by signing a consent agreement will release the county from liability. If the physician, official or lab personnel has reasonable suspicion to believe that the job applicant has tampered with the specimen, the applicant will not be considered for employment.
The county will not discriminate against applicants for employment because of a past history of drug abuse. It is the current abuse of drugs, preventing employees from performing their jobs properly, that the county will not tolerate.
Individuals who have failed a pre-employment test may initiate another inquiry with the county after a period of not shorter than six months; but they must present themselves drug-free as demonstrated by urinalysis or other test selected by the county.
(Mo. of 7-12-94)
Sec. 12-34. - Drug testing practices.
(a)
Condition of employment. Whitfield County has adopted testing practices to identify employees who use illegal drugs on or off the job. The drug test to which these personnel are required to submit is substance abuse testing. One time only, prior to testing, all employees and job applicants for employment shall be given a notice of testing, and a copy of this written policy statement. It shall be a condition of employment for all employees and job applicants after employment is offered to submit to drug and alcohol testing under the following circumstances (refusal to submit may be cause for immediate dismissal):
(1)
When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal drugs. The following circumstances could cause reasonable suspicion:
a.
Observed drug abuse.
b.
Apparent physical state of impairment.
c.
Incoherent mental state.
d.
Marked changes in personal behavior that are otherwise unexplainable.
e.
Deteriorating work performance that is not attributable to other factors.
f.
Accidents or other actions that provide reasonable cause to believe the employee may be under the influence of drugs.
(2)
When employees are involved in on-the-job accidents where personal injury or damage to company property occurs. Post-accident testing is required when employees have caused or contributed to an on-the-job injury that resulted in a loss of work time, which means any period of time during which an employee stops performing the normal duties of employment and leaves the place of employment to seek care from a licensed medical provider. Drug and alcohol tests must be performed as soon as possible after an accident, but no longer than 32 hours for drugs and eight hours for alcohol.
(3)
As part of a follow-up program of treatment for drug or alcohol abuse once the employer has been informed that the employee is again suitable for employment, the employee must test negative on the drug and alcohol screen to be reinstated and agree to further random drug testing (at least once a year for two years with no advanced notice).
(4)
Job applicants.
(5)
When a substance abuse test is conducted as part of a routinely scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination that is part of the employer's established policy or that is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification or group.
(b)
Collection and testing procedures. Specimen collection and testing shall be performed in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)

(2)
Specimen collection shall be documented, and the documentation procedures shall include:
a.
Labeling of specimen containers so as to reasonably preclude the likelihood of erroneous identification of test results; and
b.
An opportunity for the employee or job applicant to record any information he or she considers relevant to the test, including identification of currently or recently used prescription or nonprescription medication or other relevant medical information. The providing of information shall not preclude the administration of the test, but shall be taken into account in interpreting any positive confirmed results.
(3)
Specimen collection, storage, and transportation to the testing site shall be performed in a manner which will reasonably preclude specimen contamination or adulteration.
(4)
Each initial and confirmation test conducted not including the taking or collecting of a specimen to be tested, shall be conducted by a laboratory as described in subsection (13) below.
(5)
A specimen for a test may be taken or collected by any of the following persons:
a.
A physician, a physician's assistant, a registered professional nurse, a licensed practical nurse, a nurse practitioner, or a certified paramedic who is present at the scene of an accident for the purpose of rendering emergency medical service or treatment;
b.
A qualified person certified or employed by a laboratory certified by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the College of American Pathologists, or the Georgia Department of Human Resources; or
c.
A qualified person certified or employed by a collection company.

(7)
The employer shall provide to the employee or job applicant, upon request, a copy of the test results.
(8)

An employer shall pay the cost of all drug tests, initial and confirmation, which the employer requires of employees.
(11)
An employee or job applicant shall pay the cost of any additional tests not required by the employer.
(12)
If testing is conducted based on reasonable suspicion, the employer shall promptly detail in writing the circumstances which formed the basis of the determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing. A copy of this documentation shall be given to the employee upon request and the original documentation shall be kept confidential to the employer and retained by the employer.
(13)
No laboratory may analyze initial or confirmation drug or alcohol specimens unless:
a.
The laboratory is approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse or the College of American Pathologists;
b.
The laboratory has written procedures to ensure the chain of custody; and
c.
The laboratory follows proper quality control procedures including, but not limited to:
1.
The use of internal quality controls including the use of samples of known concentrations which are used to check the performance and calibration of testing equipment, and periodic use of blind samples for overall accuracy;
2.
An internal review and certification process for drug test results, conducted by a person qualified to perform that function in the testing laboratory;
3.
Security measures implemented by the testing laboratory to preclude adulteration of specimens and drug test results; and
4.
Other necessary and proper actions taken to ensure reliable and accurate drug test results.

Also, included for testing is alcohol and ethanol. An employer may test an individual for any or all of these.
(15)
Laboratories shall provide technical assistance to the employer, employee, or job applicant for the purpose of interpreting any positive confirmed test results which could have been caused by prescription or nonprescription medication taken by the employee or job applicant.
(16)
If an initial drug test is negative, the employer may in its sole discretion seek a confirmation test. Only laboratories as described in subsection (13) hereof shall conduct confirmation drug tests.
(17)
All positive initial tests shall be confirmed using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MC) method or an equivalent or more accurate scientifically accepted methods approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse as such technology becomes available in a cost-effective form.
(18)
Any employee who questions the results of a required drug test under this policy may request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. All costs for such testing are paid by the employee unless the result of the split sample test invalidates the result of the original test. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 40 as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee;
(19)
Tests for breach alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved testing device operated by a trained technician. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. Any employee who has confirmed alcohol concentration of greater than 0.02 but less than 0.04 will be removed from his/her position for eight hours unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than 0.02. An alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and in violation of the county policy.

(Mo. of 7-12-94)
Sec. 12-37. - Confidentiality.
No physician-patient relationship is created between the employee or applicant and Whitfield County, or any other person performing or evaluating a substance abuse test solely by the establishment, implementation or administration of substance abuse testing. The confidentiality of any information received by the employer through a substance abuse testing program shall be maintained, except as otherwise provided by law. The county shall release information regarding a covered employee's record as directed by specific, written consent from the employee authorizing release of information to an identified person.

Sec. 12-38. - Treatment.
(a)
Treatment programs. Participation in a treatment program will not affect the employee's career advancement or employment, nor will it protect any employee from disciplinary action if substandard job performance continues. A treatment program is a process used in conjunction with discipline, not as a substitute for discipline.
(b)
Counseling. It is the responsibility of the county's supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a drug or alcohol problem. Although it is not the supervisor's job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about the available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and co-workers should encourage anyone who has a drug or alcohol problem to seek help.
(Mo. of 7-12-94)
Sec. 12-39. - Intent of policy.
The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive and drug and alcohol free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment at Whitfield County.
(Mo. of 7-12-94)
Sec. 12-40. - Supplemental regulations for safety-sensitive employees.
A Whitfield County safety sensitive employee is any employee who holds a commercial driver's license, operators of any equipment, employees performing the job of mechanic, traffic flow technicians and all supervisors of the above. It is a violation of the county policy for safety-sensitive employees to:
(1)
Consume alcohol on the job.
(2)
Consume alcohol for four hours prior to reporting for duty.
(3)
Consume alcohol for eight hours after an accident or until they have been tested.
(4)
Consume alcohol when they are on call.
Alcohol tests will only be conducted just before, during, or just after the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. Drug tests will be conducted any time the safety-sensitive employee is on duty. A safety-sensitive employee who has a breath alcohol concentration level of 0.04 or greater is in violation of the regulations. The employee must be immediately removed from his or her safety-sensitive duties and referred to a substance abuse professional.
It shall be a condition of employment for safety-sensitive employees to submit to drug and alcohol testing under any circumstance. Safety-sensitive employees are subject to random testing which must be unannounced and spread throughout the year. Whitfield County policy does not require a second supervisor to make a reasonable suspicion referral for safety-sensitive employees and under no circumstances should an impaired employee be sent home without first being tested.
Any safety-sensitive employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution will be required to undergo an observed collection.
These regulations are in addition to and do not otherwise alter the substance abuse policy statement.

ARTICLE IV. - HARASSMENT POLICY

Sec. 12-51. - Policy.
Whitfield County is committed to maintaining a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. In keeping with this commitment, we will not tolerate harassment of employees by anyone, including any supervisor, co-worker, vendor, client or customer of Whitfield County.
(Mo. of 7-12-94, § 1)
Sec. 12-52. - Definition.
Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based upon a person's protected status, such as sex, color, race, religion, national origin, age, disability or other protected group status as provided for by law. Whitfield County will not tolerate harassing conduct that affects tangible job benefits, that interferes unreasonably with an individual's work performance, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
(Mo. of 7-12-94, § 2)
Sec. 12-53. - Sexual harassment.
Generally, sexual harassment occurs if an employer or department head makes the granting of sexual favors a condition of continued employment or promotion in Whitfield County, or if a hostile or embarrassing atmosphere is created in the workplace as a result of lewd remarks and obscene language. Allowing employees to make unwelcome advances to co-workers also falls under the definition of sexual harassment.
Additionally, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other physical, verbal, or visual conduct based on sex constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to the conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment; (2) submission to or rejection of the conduct issued as the basis for an employment decision; or (3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of reasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. Sexual harassment may include explicit sexual propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, sexual oriented "kidding," or "teasing," "practical jokes," jokes about gender-specific traits, foul or obscene language or gestures, displays of foul or obscene printed or visual material, and physical contact, such as patting, pinching, or brushing against another's body.
(Mo. of 7-12-94, § 3)
Sec. 12-54. - Harassment not tolerated.
Whitfield County will not tolerate any harassment of any nature and any charge of harassment shall be promptly and confidentially investigated.
(Mo. of 7-12-94, § 4)
Sec. 12-55. - Complaint procedure.
(a)
All employees are responsible for helping to assure that we avoid harassment. If you feel that you have experienced or witnessed harassment, either general or sexual, you are to notify immediately (preferably within 24 hours) your immediate supervisor or department head, or the personnel department, or other Whitfield County officials. If any of the above named is the harasser, then obviously, you would bypass that person and go to higher county officials. You will be asked to put your complaint in writing and the county forbids any retaliation against anyone who reports harassment.
(b)
If the allegations warrant, the county's policy is to investigate all such complaints in a prompt and confidential manner. To the fullest extent practicable, the county will keep complaints and the terms of their resolution confidential. If an investigation confirms that harassment has occurred, the county will take corrective action, including such discipline up to and including termination of employment, as is appropriate.
(c)
Whitfield County recognizes that false accusations of sexual harassment can have a serious effect on innocent men and women. Individuals falsely accusing another of sexual harassment will be disciplined in accordance with the nature and extent of his or her false accusation. The county encourages any employee to raise questions he or she may have regarding sexual harassment or this policy, with his or her immediate supervisor, a higher level department head, personnel department, or other county officials.
(d)
All harassment is strictly forbidden by the county and shall not be condoned or sanctioned in any way. Whitfield County shall deal forcefully, quickly and thoroughly with any violator as circumstances dictate and in keeping with due process of law.
