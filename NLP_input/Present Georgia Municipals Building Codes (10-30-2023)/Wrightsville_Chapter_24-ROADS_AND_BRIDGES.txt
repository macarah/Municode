Sec. 24-1. - General regulations.
(a)
Maintenance and repair of public streets. All maintenance and repair of public streets, alleys, curbs, sidewalks, and other public ways shall be under the supervision of the director of public works, which officer shall have the responsibility of enforcing all provisions of this chapter.

Maintenance of property between sidewalks and streets. All persons who own real estate in the city which abuts upon any sidewalk which is paved shall be required to keep that portion of such sidewalk which lies between the sidewalk and curb of the street in good and smooth condition and free from growing weeds and other obnoxious and unsightly vegetation or other things which would mar or detract from the beauty and cleanliness of the streets upon which their properties abut. Any property owner who shall place or allow grass to grow upon the portion of the sidewalk lying between the sidewalk and curb of the street as aforesaid, and upon which his real estate abuts, shall keep such grass properly mowed and free from rubbish of all kinds. If such owners are not in possession of their property, then this section shall apply to their tenants or those who have possession or control of the same.
(c)
Report of defects, obstructions, deposits, and discharges. It shall be the duty of every city officer and employee who becomes aware of any defect or obstruction, or of any unlawful deposit or discharge, in or on any public street, alley, curb, sidewalk, or other public way of the city to report the same to the director of public works as soon as possible.
(d)
Trees and shrubs.
(1)
Planting and removal. It shall be unlawful for any person to plant, remove, injure, or cut any tree, bush, or shrub in or from any public street, parkway, or other public place except for required maintenance by the owner and/or occupant of property causing obstructions as stated hereinbelow, or without first obtaining a permit therefor from the city clerk in the manner specified in this chapter.
(2)
Dangerous trees. Any trees, shrubs, or materials of any kind whatsoever which overhang any sidewalk, street, or other public place in the city in such a way as to impede or interfere with traffic or travel, or which may otherwise cause any danger, shall be trimmed by the owner of the premises on which such tree or shrub grows so that the obstruction shall cease. Any tree or limb of a tree which is likely to fall on or across any public way or place shall be removed by the owner of the premises on which such tree grows or stands. The director of public works may cause, without notice to the owner, any such tree, shrub or growth to be trimmed or removed, and, without notice to the owner, any and all such trees, shrubs, or materials of any kind whatsoever which cause, in his sole discretion, an obstruction or danger to traffic or passage.

(Code 2007, § 7-100)
Sec. 24-2. - Street construction and improvements.
A municipality may grant permits and establish reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance, renewal, removal, and relocation of pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, poles, towers, traffic and other signals, and other equipment, facilities, or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over, or under any part of its municipal street system and of a county road system lying within its municipal limits. However, such regulations shall not be more restrictive with respect to utilities affected thereby than are equivalent regulations promulgated by the department with respect to utilities on the state highway system under authority of O.C.G.A. § 32-6-174. As a condition precedent to the granting of such permits, the municipality may require application in writing specifically describing the nature, extent, and location of the portion of the utility affected. The municipality may also require the applicant to furnish an indemnity bond or other acceptable security conditioned to pay for any damage to any part of a public road or to any member of the public caused by the work of the utility performed under authority of such permit. However, it shall be the duty of the municipality to ensure that the normal operation of the utility does not interfere with the use of any portion of the municipal street system or of a municipal extension of a county public road.
(1)
Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct or lay any pavement or take any other action for or on any public street, sidewalk, curb, alley, or other public way, or to repair the same, without having first obtained a permit from the city clerk in the manner specified in this chapter.
(2)
Bond. Each application for a permit to construct or improve any pavement on any public street, sidewalk, curb, alley, or other public way shall be required to file a bond with the amount and issuer to be approved by the city council, conditioned to indemnify the city from loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, the work undertaken.
(3)
Specifications.
a.
In general. All street and sidewalk pavements and all curbing shall be laid in conformity with the specifications established or approved from time to time by the mayor and city council, as provided in chapter 26.
b.
Curb ramping. The standard for construction of curbs on each side of any city street, or any connecting street or road for which curbs have been prescribed, shall have not less than one ramp per lineal block on the crosswalks at intersections. Such ramps shall be at least 40 inches wide and so constructed as to allow reasonable access to the crosswalk for physically handicapped persons.
(4)
Barricades. Any person, firm, or corporation laying or repairing any pavement on a street, curb, sidewalk, or other public place shall maintain suitable barricades to prevent injury to any person or vehicle by reason of the work, which barricades shall be protected by a light at nighttime.
(Code 2007, § 7-101)
Sec. 24-3. - Excavations.
(a)
Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to dig up, break, excavate, tunnel, undermine, or in any manner break up any street, or to make or cause to be made any excavation in or under the surface of any street for any purpose, or to place, deposit, or leave upon any street any earth or other excavated material obstructing or tending to interfere with the free use of the street, unless such person shall first have obtained a permit from the city clerk in the manner specified in this chapter.
(b)
Excavation permit fee. The excavation permit fee to be collected by the city clerk shall be in an amount varying with the type of surface to be opened, dug, or excavated under the permit issued as established from time to time by the city. The fee schedule shall be maintained on file by the clerk.
(c)
Surety bond. Each applicant for an excavation permit shall be required to file a surety bond with the city clerk in the amount as determined by the city based on the extent and nature of the permitted activity. The required surety bond must be:
(1)
With good and sufficient surety approved by the city council;
(2)
Satisfactory to the city attorney in form and substance; and
(3)
Conditioned upon the permittee's agreement to secure and hold harmless the city and its officers against any and all claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the city, the city council, or any city officer may be made liable by reason of an accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned on the permittee's agreement to fill up, restore, and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to the satisfaction of the director of the public works, all openings and excavations made in public streets, and to maintain any street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after said work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before said work shall have been done. Any settlement of the surface within said two-year period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective back-filling by the permittee. Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond, but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given. In the event of any suit or claim against the city by reason of the negligence or default of the permittee, upon the city's giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim, any final judgment against the city requiring it to pay for such damage shall be conclusive upon the permittee and its surety.
(d)
Routing of traffic. The permittee shall take measures as required by the city to ensure that during the performance of the work, traffic conditions shall be maintained at all times as nearly normal as practicable so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupants to the abutting property and to the general public. The road superintendent and the director of public works may recommend the closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time, or any other maintenance of traffic measure. The permittee shall route and control traffic, including its own vehicles, as directed by the city police department, and according to the permit conditions. The following steps shall be taken before any highway may be closed or restricted:
(1)
The permittee must receive the approval of the director of public works and the police department.
(2)
The permittee must notify the chief of the fire department of any street so closed.
(3)
Upon completion of construction work, the permittee shall notify the director of public works and the city police department before traffic is moved back to its normal flow so that any necessary adjustments may be made.
(4)
Where flagpersons are deemed necessary by the chief of police, they shall be furnished by the permittee at his own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible, the director of public works will designate detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee, but in case there are not existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at its expense and in conformity with the specifications of the director of public works. The permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage to any highways by the operation of its equipment.
(e)
Clearance for fire equipment. The work shall be performed and conducted so as not to interfere with access to fire stations and fire hydrants. Materials or obstructions shall not be placed within 15 feet of fire plugs. Passageways leading to fire escapes or firefighting equipment shall be kept free of piles of materials or other obstructions.
(f)
Protection of traffic. The permittee shall construct and maintain adequate and safe crossings over excavations and across highways under improvement to accommodate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all street intersections. Vehicular crossings shall be constructed and maintained of materials of adequate size and strength to accommodate vehicular traffic safely; pedestrian crossings shall be of adequate thickness, width, and length, together with necessary blockings to ensure safe passage by pedestrians.
(g)
Interference with utilities. The permittee shall not interfere with any existing utility without the written consent of the director of public works and the utility company or the person owning the utility. If it becomes necessary to remove an existing utility, this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work is borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately-owned utilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the owner of the utility. The permittee shall support and protect all pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the work. In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus should be damaged, they shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them, and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee, and the bond of same shall be liable therefor. The permittee shall be responsible for any damage done to any public or private property by reason of the breaking of any water pipe, sewer, gas pipe, electrical conduit, or other utility, and its bond shall be liable therefor. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground utilities and protect the same against damage.
(h)
Protection of adjoining property. The permittee shall at all times, and at its own expense, preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain permission from the owner of such private property. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the work and shall be responsible for all damage to public and private property or highways resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be replaced. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as near as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or easements across private property without first having notified and obtained the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property, the director of public works.
(i)
Protective measures. The permittee shall erect such fence, railing, or barriers about the worksite as shall prevent danger to persons using the streets or sidewalks, and such protective barriers shall be maintained until the work shall be completed or the danger removed. At twilight, there shall be placed suitable and sufficient lights which shall be kept burning throughout the night for the duration of such obstructions.
(j)
Attractive nuisances. It shall be unlawful for the permittee to allow to remain unguarded any machinery, equipment, or other device having the characteristics of an attractive nuisance likely to attract children and be hazardous to their safety or health.
(k)
Care of excavated material. All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled and maintained in such a manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians, or users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining property.
(l)
Damage to existing improvements. All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the excavation work shall be repaired by the permittee. Materials for such repair shall conform to the requirements of any applicable code provision or ordinance. If, upon being ordered, the permittee fails to furnish the necessary labor and materials for such repairs, the director of public works shall have the authority to cause said necessary labor and materials to be furnished by the city, and the cost shall be charged against the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable on its bond therefor.
(m)
Cleanup. As the excavation work progresses, all streets and private properties shall be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock, and other debris resulting from such work. All cleanup operations at the location of such excavations shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the director of public works. From time to time, as may be ordered by the director of public works, and in any event, immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from said work, and upon failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the director of public works, said work may be done by the city and the cost thereof charged to the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided for hereunder.
(n)
Back-filling. Back-filling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an excavation permit issued hereunder shall be compacted to a degree equivalent to that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug and in a manner consistent with sound engineering practices generally recognized in the construction industry.
(o)
Restoration of surface.
(1)
The permittee shall restore the surface of all streets broken into or damaged as a result of the excavation work to its original condition in accordance with the specifications of the director of public works. The permittee may be required to place a temporary surface over openings made in paved traffic lanes and shall be required to exercise special care in making and maintaining such temporary restorations to ensure safe traveling conditions until such time as permanent restorations are made.
(2)
Permanent restoration of streets shall be made by the permittee in strict accordance with the specifications prescribed by the director of public works.
(3)
Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the director of public works shall not prevent the city from asserting a claim against the permittee and its surety under the surety bond required hereunder for incomplete or defective work if such defects are discovered within 24 months from the completion of the excavation work.
(p)
City's right to restore surface.
(1)
If the permittee shall have failed to restore the surface of the street to its original and proper condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by the permit, the director of public works, if he deems it advisable, shall have the right to do all work and things necessary to restore the street and to complete the excavation work. The permittee shall be liable for the actual cost, in addition, for general overhead and administrative expenses.
(2)
It shall be the duty of the permittee to guarantee and maintain the site of the excavation work in the same condition it was prior to the excavation for two years after restoring it to its original condition.
(q)
Prompt completion of work. The permittee shall prosecute with diligence and expediency all excavation work covered by the excavation permit and shall promptly complete such work and restore the street to its original condition, or as near as may be, as soon as practicable, and in any event, not later than the date specified in the excavation permit.
(r)
Emergency work. In the event of any emergency in which a sewer, main, conduit, or utility in or under any street breaks, bursts, or otherwise is in such condition as to immediately endanger the property, life, health, or safety of any individual, the person owning or controlling such sewer, main, conduit, or utility, without first applying for and obtaining an excavation permit hereunder, shall immediately take proper emergency measures to cure or remedy the dangerous conditions for the protection of the property, life, health, and safety of individuals. However, such person owning or controlling such facility shall apply for an excavation permit not later than the end of the next succeeding day during which the city clerk's office is open for business, and shall not proceed with permanent repairs without first obtaining an excavation permit as herein provided.
(s)
Noise, dust, debris. Each permittee shall conduct and carry out the excavation work in such manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and occupants of neighboring property. The permittee shall take appropriate measures to reduce to the fullest extent practicable noise, dust, and unsightly debris, and, between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., shall not use, except with the express written permission of the director of public works or in the case of an emergency as herein provided, any tool or equipment producing noise of sufficient volume to disturb the sleep of the occupants of the neighboring property.
