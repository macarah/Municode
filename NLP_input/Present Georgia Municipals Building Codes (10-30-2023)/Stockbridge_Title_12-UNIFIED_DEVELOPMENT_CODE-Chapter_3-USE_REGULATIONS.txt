"Rooftop solar energy system" means an SES that is structurally mounted to the roof of a house, building, or other structure and does not qualify as an Integrated SES.
4.
"Ground mounted solar energy system" means an SES that is structurally mounted to the ground and does not qualify as an Integrated SES. For purposes of the City of Stockbridge UDC, any solar canopy that does not qualify as an Integrated SES shall be considered a ground mounted SES, regardless of where it is mounted. The footprint of a ground mounted SES is calculated by drawing a perimeter around the outermost SES panels and any equipment necessary for the functioning of the SES, such as transformers and inverters. The footprint does not include any visual buffer or perimeter fencing. Transmission lines (or portions thereof) required to connect the SES to a utility or consumer outside the SES perimeter shall not be included in calculating the footprint. Ground mounted SESs shall be delineated by size as follows:
a.
"Small scale ground mounted solar energy system (small scale SES)" means a ground mounted SES with a footprint of less than two (2) acres.
b.
"Intermediate scale ground mounted solar energy system (intermediate scale SES)" means a ground mounted SES with a footprint of between two (2) to fifteen (15) acres.
c.
"Large scale ground mounted solar energy system (large scale SES)" means a ground mounted SES with a footprint of more than fifteen (15) acres.
B.
Applicability. Any SES that, prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived; is in operation, is being lawfully sited, constructed, or installed; or has caused the incurrence of substantial liabilities relating to siting, construction, or installation; shall be exempt from complying with these supplemental regulations unless the surface area of an integrated SES or rooftop SES or the footprint of a ground mounted SES is increased by more than ten percent (10%) after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived.
C.
General Requirements for All Solar Energy Systems. The following requirements apply to all SESs.
1.
Height. An integrated or rooftop SES shall be given an equivalent exemption, if any, to the applicable zoning district's height restrictions for roof-mounted mechanical devices or equipment, except a rooftop SES mounted on a sloped roof shall not vertically exceed the highest point of the roof to which it is attached.
2.
Impervious Surface. Ground mounted structures and components of the ground mounted SES, including transformers and foundations, shall be considered impervious. However, for purposes of compliance with the Stockbridge zoning code's impervious surface coverage requirements, the panels of a ground mounted SES shall be considered pervious if they maintain sheet flow and allow for water to infiltrate under and around them through a pervious surface and into the subsoil.
3.
Lighting. To reduce light pollution, lighting of a ground mounted SES shall:
a.
Be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for its safe operation;
b.
Be directed downward where reasonably feasible;
c.
Incorporate full cut-off fixtures; and
d.
Reasonably utilize motion sensors.
4.
Tree Removal. The removal of trees or natural vegetation for any SES shall be avoided to the extent reasonably practicable and shall comply with the requirements of the City of Stockbridge UDC.
5.
Location. All ground mounted SESs permitted as an accessory use, in any district, must be located in the rear yard of the property and must be screened so as not visible from the public right-of-way.
6.
Decommissioning. Decommissioning shall begin no later than twelve (12) months after a ground mounted SES has ceased to generate electricity or thermal energy. Within six (6) months of the beginning of decommissioning, the SES and all structures associated with it shall be removed, all materials shall be recycled or otherwise reused to the extent reasonably practicable, and the property shall be returned to its condition prior to the installation of the SES or to some other condition reasonably appropriate for the designated land use.
D.
Specific Requirements for Intermediate and Large-Scale Solar Energy Systems. The following requirements apply to intermediate and large-scale SESs, in addition to the general requirements in this section that apply to all SESs.
1.
Setbacks. An intermediate or large-scale SES shall comply with the following setback requirements: The intermediate or large-scale SES shall be located no closer than the lesser of:
a.
Fifteen (15) feet from any property line; or
b.
The required setback for the applicable zoning district, if any; the intermediate or large-scale SES shall be located no closer than the lesser of:
i.
Twenty (20) feet from any public right-of-way; or
ii.
The required setback for the applicable zoning district, if any; and the intermediate scale SES shall be located no closer than fifty (50) feet from any residential dwelling unit on an adjacent lot.
The large-scale SES shall be located no closer than one hundred (100) feet from any residential dwelling unit on an adjacent lot.
2.
Visual Buffers. An intermediate or large-scale SES shall have, to the extent reasonably practicable, a visual buffer of natural vegetation, plantings, earth berms, and/or fencing that provides a reasonable visual and lighting screen to reduce the view of the SES from residential dwelling units on adjacent lots (including those lots located across a public right-of-way). The existing natural tree growth and natural landforms along the SES perimeter may create a sufficient buffer and shall be preserved when reasonably practicable.
3.
Signage. An intermediate or large-scale SES shall display signs (a) stating the risks that may result from contact with an intermediate scale SES, (b) identifying the owner or operator of the intermediate scale SES, and (c) providing a twenty-four-hour emergency contact phone number; shall comply with the requirements of the applicable zoning district for displaying any advertisement; and may have signs that contain educational information about the SES.

2.
A pool shall be enclosed by a security fence of not less than four (4) feet in height from ground level. Security fence shall not be required for above ground pools that are greater than four (4) feet in height, provided that the entrance to such pools shall be restricted with a gate. A gate shall be installed at all entrances to any deck structure which is attached to such pool and/or at all ladder structures accessing such pool.
3.
All gates that are attached to such security fences shall contain self-closing positive latch devices to ensure that the pool is enclosed and secure at all times.

2.
The community development director may issue a one-time, one-year extension of completion time for cause beyond the original completion period upon written request by the owner, including the reason for the request and an updated account of completed houses within the subdivision.
