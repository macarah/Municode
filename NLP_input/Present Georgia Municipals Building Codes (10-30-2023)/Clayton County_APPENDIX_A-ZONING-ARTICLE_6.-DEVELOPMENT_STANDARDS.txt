Sec. 6.37 - Telecommunication Facilities Standards (TF).
TF-01: This Telecommunication Facility Standards section applies to all districts.
The intent of this Telecommunications Ordinance is to ensure that residents and businesses in Clayton County have reliable access to telecommunications networks and state of the art communications services while also ensuring that this objective is achieved in a fashion that preserves the intrinsic aesthetic character of the community and is accomplished according to Clayton County's zoning, planning, and design standards. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave local government's land use and zoning authority, with certain limitations, to determine the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. Clayton County recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to Clayton County and a significant benefit to its residents. The intent of this wireless communication facilities ordinance is to accomplish the above stated objectives and to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities complies with all applicable federal laws, and is consistent with Clayton County's land use policies, and wireless telecommunications ordinance.
A.
This Ordinance is enacted for the purpose of safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare by establishing general guidelines for the location and placement of antennas and towers. The goals of the ordinance are to:
1.
Ensure access to reliable wireless communications services throughout all areas of Clayton County;
2.
Encourage the use of existing monopoles, towers, utility poles, and other structures for the co-location of telecommunications facilities;
3.
Encourage the location of new monopoles and towers in non-residential areas;
4.
Minimize the number of new monopoles and towers that would otherwise need to be constructed by providing incentives for the use of existing structures;
5.
Encourage the location of monopoles and towers, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community will be minimal;
6.
Minimize the potential adverse effects associated with the construction of monopoles and towers through the implementation of reasonable design, landscaping and construction practices;
7.
Ensure public health, safety, welfare, and convenience; and
8.
Conform to Federal and State laws that allow certain antennas to be exempt from local regulations.
TF-02: General Requirements.
A.
Principal or Accessory Use: Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses.
B.
Inventory of Existing Sites: Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the Zoning Administrator an inventory of its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the Clayton County or within one (1) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower or antenna.
C.
Aesthetics: Towers and antennas shall meet the following aesthetics requirements.
1.
Finish: Any tower shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
Related Structures: At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings.
3.
Lighting: Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
4.
State or Federal Requirements: All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Ordinance shall, to the extent required by the FAA or the FCC, bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency.

(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 21, 5-30-17)
Sec. 6.48 - Auto Brokers (AB).
AB-01: Definition.
An auto broker is an individual who markets passenger vehicles from an office with the actual vehicles being stored off-site. Customers typically conduct their vehicle search on-line and vehicles purchased are delivered directly from the storage lot to the buyer without the necessity of being brought to the office location. Auto brokers are license by the Georgia State Board of Registration of Used Motor Vehicle Dealers & Used Motor Vehicle Parts Dealers.
AB-02: Purpose.
Auto brokers are a use apart from car dealers since, as defined, display of vehicles by an auto broker on a lot within the County is prohibited. The use is therefore, relegated to that of an office use. Such office uses do not ordinarily contribute to a walkable commercial district that features attractive shops, eateries and service uses that contribute to formation of an inviting destination. Accordingly, auto brokers are deemed compatible with other uses permitted in an Office-Institutional District. Auto broker operations are characterized by on-line marketing of vehicles, without need of face-to-face contact. Such interaction is the antithesis of welcoming shopping districts in which purchases are made, and meetings are held, as in the case of a law office or a real estate office. Clayton County commercial districts should be reserved for retail, office and service uses where a good or service is delivered on-site to the customer.
AB-03: Applicable Zoning Districts.
Auto brokers may be established in the O-I, Office-Institutional District.
AB-04: Development Standards.
(a)
License required. Any auto broker, as herein defined and consistent with the term "motor vehicle broker" as such term is defined in O.C.G.A., section 43-47-2, doing business within Clayton County shall obtain a license from the County Clerk in the manner specified in this chapter.
(b)
Procedure for issuance. The County Clerk shall forward all applications for an auto broker occupational tax permit to the Zoning Administrator within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of an application. The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and, if approved, forward a written decision in the form of a Zoning Certification to the County Clerk within ten (10) business days of receipt of an application. The County Clerk shall then forward the Zoning Certification to the applicant.
