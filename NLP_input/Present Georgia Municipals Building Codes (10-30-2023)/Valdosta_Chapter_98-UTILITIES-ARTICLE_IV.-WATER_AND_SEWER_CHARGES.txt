DIVISION 4. - CONSTRUCTION COST RECOVERY

Sec. 98-651. - Purpose of construction cost recovery.
The purpose of the construction cost recovery is for the city to recover part of the construction cost for the installation of water transmission mains and trunk sewer lines. This will be done by means of a surcharge fee based on either the area of development or the potential water and/or sewer demand from the development, whichever is greater. Such fee shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk.
(Code 1976, § 5-3041; Ord. No. 85-22, 5-9-1985; Ord. No. 88-51, 10-6-1988; Ord. No. 97-39, § 1, 7-10-1997)
Sec. 98-652. - Method of payment or fee collection.
The fee required by this division will be paid upon receipt of an application for a building permit for all development other than single-family residential. The cost recovery fee for single-family residential subdivisions shall be paid at the time a subdivision phase is accepted for recording for sale of the lots. There shall also be an amortization charge placed on the schedule for permits that are applied for after each January 1, following the date of completion of construction. This amortization fee shall be applied to the base surcharge rates effective January 1 and on each succeeding year until development is complete or the construction cost recovery is rescinded. Should there be a use or development that is not specifically listed in the water or sewer use schedule, the city engineer or the director of utilities shall have the authority to compute an equivalent sewer use based on the equivalent residential rate established. It should also be noted that the construction cost recovery fee is over and above any other fee established by the city.
