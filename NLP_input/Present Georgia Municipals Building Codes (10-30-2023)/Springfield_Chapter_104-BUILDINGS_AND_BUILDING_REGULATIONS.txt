Where the building official relies upon such affidavit, the architect or engineer shall assume full responsibility for the compliance with all provisions of the technical codes and other pertinent laws or ordinances.
Sec. 104-111. - Issuing permits.

Sec. 104-113. - Conditions of the permit.
(a)
Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the technical codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building official.
(b)
Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are approved by the building official.
(c)
Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall endorse in writing or by stamp both sets of plans, "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative.
Sec. 104-114. - Fees.
(a)
Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees as prescribed in subsection (d) of this section have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, has been paid.
(b)
Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees.

(e)
Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of the building alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including materials and labor.
Sec. 104-115. - Inspections.

The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system;

(3)
That an equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case; or

The true intent and meaning of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes or any of the regulations thereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted.
(b)
Variances. The construction board of adjustment and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of the building, electrical gas, mechanical or plumbing codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following:
(1)
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others;
(2)
That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant;
(3)
That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes to other buildings, structures or service systems;
(4)
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system; and
(5)
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
(c)
Conditions of the variance. In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the building, electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing codes.
