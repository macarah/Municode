ARTICLE VII. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION

Sec. 42-473. - Purpose, authority, etc.
(a)
Findings. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Fannin County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of Fannin County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within Fannin County.
(c)
Authority. This article is enacted pursuant to the authority contained in Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 1 and Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Georgia Constitution, and O.C.G.A. code sections 12-2-8(b), 50.8.7.1(b), and 50-8-2(a)(18)(B).
(d)
Jurisdiction. This article shall apply to the unincorporated areas of Fannin County and to any incorporated area electing to adopt this article.
(e)
Cite. This article shall be known and cited as the "Water Supply Watershed Protection Ordinance."
(f)
Interpretation. This article shall be interpreted in conjunction with federal and state rules, regulations and laws, and other Fannin County ordinances contained or referenced herein.

Sec. 42-474. - Water supply watershed district established.
(a)
The Toccoa River and the Ellijay River Water Supply Watershed Districts are hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains the City of McCaysville public water supply intake, the City of Blue Ridge public water supply intake, and the City of Ellijay (Gilmer County, Georgia) public water supply intake. The boundaries of this district are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes or reservoirs. This district shall be further delineated and defined on the Water Supply Watershed Protection District Map of Fannin County. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference.
(b)
The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and the boundaries shall be identified on the Water Supply Watershed Protection District Map:
(1)
The Toccoa River is a large water supply watershed. Intakes for both the City of McCaysville and the City of Blue Ridge are located on this river. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir as defined by this article.
(2)
The Ellijay River is a small water supply watershed. An intake for the City of Ellijay is located on this river. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir as defined by this article.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. IX, art. II)
Sec. 42-475. - Protection criteria.
(a)
The following regulations shall apply to the Toccoa River water supply watershed identified on the adopted map as a large water supply watershed without a reservoir. New facilities, located within seven miles of a water supply intake or water supply reservoir, which handle hazardous material of the types listed in section 312 of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and amounts of 10,000 pounds on any one day or more, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements or the requirements of the Standard Fire Prevention Code.
(b)
The following regulations shall apply to the Ellijay River water supply watershed identified on the adopted map as a small water supply watershed without a reservoir:
(1)
The corridors of all perennial streams within a seven-mile radius upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake or water supply reservoir must be protected by the following criteria:
a.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 100 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
b.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
c.
Septic tanks and septic tank drain fields are prohibited in the 150-foot setback area as described in subsection (b)(1)b of this section.
(2)
The corridors of all perennial streams outside a seven-mile radius upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake or water supply reservoir must be protected by the following criteria:
a.
A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks.
b.
No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 75-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
c.
Septic tanks and septic tank drain fields are prohibited in the 75-foot setback area as described in subsection (b)(2)b of this section.
(3)
No more than 25 percent of the land area of any parcel or lot on which new development is placed may be covered by impervious surfaces within the water supply watershed protection district.
(4)
Exceptions.
a.
Land uses existing prior to the initial promulgation of the Fannin County water supply watershed protection districts. For the purposes of this article a pre-existing use is defined as any land use or land disturbing activity, including all human endeavors directly associated with such use or activity, which prior to the initial promulgation of this article falls within one of the following categories:
1.
