Sec. 54-7. - Approval process.
(a)
The following uses are subject to expedited approval, which shall be defined as approval within 60 days of receiving applications, supporting engineering certifications and lease approval, if any, without the necessity of public hearing:
(1)
Collocation on a previously approved wireless support structure as defined at O.C.G.A. § 36-66B-3(8) or modification of wireless facilities as defined at O.C.G.A. § 36-66B-3(9). However, with respect to applications for collocation that do not independently satisfy the definition of modification, if any of the following apply:
a.
The proposed collocation increases the overall height or width of the wireless support structure to which the wireless facilities are to be attached;
b.
The proposed collocation increases the dimensions of the equipment compound approved by the local governing authority;
c.
The proposed collocation does not comply with applicable conditions of approval, if any, applied to the initial wireless facilities and wireless support structure, as well as any subsequently adopted amendments to such conditions of approval; and
d.
The proposed collocation exceeds the applicable weight limits for the wireless support structure, as demonstrated by a letter from a structural engineer licensed to practice in this state;
then expedited permitting under subsection 54-7(a) shall not apply and the applicant shall be required to utilize subsection 54-7(b).
(2)
If a proposed modification will result in a buffer encroachment, tower setback encroachment, or other condition on property requiring a variance from any of the provisions of chapter 54 (other than allowed modified height and associated equipment compound increases), then the applicant shall be required to tender a variance request as part of the modification application. The variance request will be considered by the mayor and city council concurrently with the request for modification, and notwithstanding any provision of chapter 64 regarding the processing or advertising of variances, a request for variance made hereunder shall only be required to adhere to the procedural requirements of the State of Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq.
(b)
If the proposed tower or antenna is not included under the above-described expedited approval uses, or the application does not on its face satisfy the development standards and other criteria specified herein, then a public hearing before the mayor and council and planning commission shall be required for the approval of the construction of a telecommunications facility in all zoning districts.
Applicants shall apply for two public hearings, one before the planning commission and the mayor and city council through the community development department and pay the fee for such review in accordance with the fee schedule published by the city. The applications shall also go before the city design review board for its review prior to the planning commission meeting. Applications, when complete, shall be placed on the next available agenda of the planning commission and mayor and council at which zoning matters are considered. At least 30 days prior to any scheduled hearing, the community development department shall cause a sign to be posted on the property and the publication of a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation. Said notice shall state the nature of the application, street location of the proposal and height of the proposed structure as well as the time, date and location of each hearing. The community development department shall also give similar notice by regular mail to all property owners and/or current residents within 500 feet of the boundaries of the subject property with a minimum of 75 owners who appear on the city tax records as retrieved by the city's geographic information system. The notices shall be mailed a minimum of 14 days prior to the first scheduled hearing. Re-notification by mail is required when a petition is recommended for deferral by the planning commission for any amount of time or is deferred by the mayor and city council.
Before approving an application, the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. The factors considered in granting such a permit include those enumerated in sections 54-5 and 54-6 above. The mayor and council may waive one or more of these criteria, if, in their discretion doing so will advance the goals of this chapter as stated in section 54-1 above.
If the city council determines that any application does not meet the general application requirements, development requirements and/or standards enumerated herein, or such application conflicts with the existing tower map, approval of the application shall be denied provided substantial evidence exists to support such denial. Any aggrieved party may appeal the denial to a court of competent jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, an aggrieved party is one who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated.
Approved applications shall expire one year from the date of the approval by the mayor and council unless the property owner makes substantial progress toward the completion of on-site construction depicted on the site plan. Substantial progress shall have been demonstrated when, within one year of the date of the issuance of the telecommunications facility permit, the director of community development department determines that continuous, observable progress is being made to completion according to an approved construction schedule.

(b)
All maintenance or construction on telecommunications facilities shall be performed by persons employed by or under contract to the owner between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday except in cases of emergency or when an after-hours permit is obtained pursuant to the City of Milton Noise Ordinance. Access to facilities on city-owned property shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the department responsible for such property. The hours of access to City sites shall not exceed those specified above. Persons may not be present on site unless performing construction or maintenance at such site.
(c)
The owner or user of any new or existing telecommunications facility shall be required to register and obtain a "telecommunications operating license" from the community development department on or before July 31 each and every calendar year. The telecommunications operating license shall serve as a mechanism for obtaining current information regarding telecommunication permit holders and annually inspecting and documenting the condition of permitted towers, antennas, and other telecommunications facilities. The telecommunications operating license application shall be on such forms as may be prepared by the community development department. No telecommunications operating license application shall be considered by the community development department until it is complete and accompanied by all necessary documents, papers, proof of liability insurance, and other evidence of eligibility as may be set forth or otherwise required by the application. All telecommunications towers, each antenna array located thereon, on a rooftop or other location, shall each obtain a separate license, paying a separate fee for each such license. A license is not transferable or assignable.

For purposes of this subsection, a predecessor business (whether a sole proprietorship, corporation, partnership, or other entity) shall be a business engaged in substantially the same or related business as the applicant and from whom the applicant acquired title to or possession of a substantial portion of its business property, either directly or indirectly, whether real or personal, and for which taxes are outstanding.
e.
There are conditions on the premises or in the business operations conducted thereon that endanger public health or safety.
f.

(d)
Any antenna or tower that is (1) not operated for a continuous period of 12 months or (2) is not properly maintained or (3) is not in possession of a current and valid license shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same and any structures housing supporting equipment within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed or returned to good condition within said 90 days, the governing authority may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense and a lien shall be placed upon the property. In the event that an antenna or tower is not in possession of required licensure the city, in its discretion may, instead of requiring removal of said tower or antenna, may treat same as a code violation and impose daily citations to compel compliance.
