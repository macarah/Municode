Sec. 73-2. - Findings.
After extensive research, study and deliberation the county commission has determined:
(1)
Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly and safely designed business environment, the protection of property values and the promotion of tourism in this unique community;
(2)
An improperly regulated sign environment poses health and safety hazards to the public;
(3)
The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; and
(4)
Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic well-being of the county will be enhanced as a place to live, work, and conduct business.
(5)
Identify entrances into the city and county that should be cultivated as gateways into our communities, illustrative of the charm that our community wants to portray.
(6)
This section will identify regulatory measures for improving the aesthetics and safety of highway corridors, with guidelines and sign regulations in order to beautify the roadway so that it is attractive to residents and travelers.
(7)
Discourage sign development in conservation areas in order to protect our natural resources and preserve our rural character.

Sec. 73-3. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish standards for the fabrication, erection, use, maintenance and alteration of signs, symbols, markings or advertising devices within the county. These standards are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of persons within the county by providing regulations which allow and encourage creativity, effectiveness, and flexibility in the design and use of such devices while promoting traffic safety and avoiding an environment that encourages visual blight.
(b)
It is also the purpose of this chapter to prohibit the future erection, placement, or location of off-site, portable, and certain other types of signs determined to be detrimental to the aesthetic sense and public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the county.
(c)
Any sign, device or display allowed under this chapter may contain, in lieu of any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that does not direct attention to a business operated for profit, or to a commodity or service for sale, and that complies with size, lighting, and location requirements of this chapter.
(d)
A determination has also been made by the county commission that the regulations contained in this chapter are the minimum regulations necessary to achieve the purposes set out above.
