This chapter and the restrictions against nuisances are imposed and designed only for the protection of the public health, safety, welfare, comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants of the city.
Sec. 20-4. - Definition; abatement.
(a)
Defined. A "public nuisance" is anything that is injurious or harmful to the health, comfort, or convenience of the inhabitants of the city or which annoys, injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health, or safety of three or more unrelated persons or offends public decency shall be deemed a public nuisance. Such activities include but are not limited to the following activities:
(1)
Placing, keeping, maintaining, or otherwise allowing old cars, appliances, furniture, or other types of material or debris on any parcel of land located within the city.
(2)
Playing loud music.

Public fighting.
(4)
Public yelling or screaming.
(5)
Loud gatherings in public which disturb neighbors.
(6)
Shouting obscenities.
(7)
Constantly honking horns or other devices that cause loud noises.
The fact that an act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable person.
(b)
Failure to abate a nuisance upon notice. Any person maintaining or causing to be maintained a nuisance on their property or elsewhere in the city shall, upon notice being given by the mayor and/or the city council, immediately abate such nuisance, and in no event shall the nuisance be allowed to continue in excess of 30 days from the date of the receipt of notice by the violator. Upon failure to abate the nuisance, the violator shall be cited to appear at the municipal court, which shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the question of the existence of such nuisance and, if found to exist, to order its abatement. Upon the municipal court finding that a nuisance exists and ordering its abatement, any person failing and refusing to abate such nuisance within 30 days from the date of the order issued by the municipal court shall be guilty of a violation of this section.
(c)
Abatement of nuisance. The city shall have the right, upon the failure and refusal of any person to abate a nuisance after that person has been ordered to do so by the municipal court, to abate the nuisance, and should there be expenses attending such abatement, the city shall have the right to assess the expenses against the person so offending. The city shall have the right to issue an execution against such person for said expenses, which execution shall constitute a lien against the property of such person. The levy and sale of said property shall be had in accordance with the law governing execution sales for cities in the state. If any property is removed by the city pursuant to this section, the owner of said property shall automatically forfeit his rights to said property and title and ownership shall thereafter be vested in the city.
