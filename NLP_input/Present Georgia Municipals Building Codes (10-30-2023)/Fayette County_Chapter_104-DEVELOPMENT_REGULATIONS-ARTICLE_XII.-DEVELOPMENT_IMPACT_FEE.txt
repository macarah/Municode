Sec. 104-494. - Credits.
(a)
In the calculation of development impact fees for a particular project, credits shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, or contribution, or dedication of land, or money required or accepted by the county from a developer, or his predecessor in title or interest, for system improvements of the category for which the development impact fee is being collected. Credits shall not be given for project improvements.
(b)
Credits under subsection (a) of this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
(1)
For the present value of the construction of any system improvements required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the county from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the developer must present evidence of the cost and age of the improvement from which present value may be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) as estimates of inflation and depreciation.
(2)
For the present value of any contribution or dedication of land required or accepted for system improvements, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought by the county from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value for contributed land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the current validated the county tax appraisal at the time of dedication; present value shall be calculated from the time of dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(3)
For the present value of any contribution or dedication of money required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the county from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value of contributed money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution or dedication; present value shall be calculated from time of contribution or dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(c)
Upon submission of adequate evidence that a development impact fee was previously paid and that the building permit has expired, credit for the present value of the development impact fee shall be in the amount of the development impact fee paid, inflated from the date of payments using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) and shall be applied against that parcel of land. Should the development impact fee be less than the amount credited, under the circumstances previously mentioned herein, the excess credit shall remain with the county. Should the development impact fee be greater than the amount credited, under the circumstances previously mentioned herein, the developer shall pay the difference to the county.
(d)
In the event that a developer enters into an agreement with the county to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements such that the amount of credit created by such construction, funding, or contribution exceeds the development impact fee calculated for the project, the developer shall be compensated for such excess contribution by the county or, at the county's option, from development impact fees paid by other developments located in the service area benefitted by such improvements. The present value of any such construction or contribution shall be established by:
(1)
Use of documented prices actually paid by the developer for the system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent); or
(2)
Use of documented prices which would have been paid by the county for such system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent), whichever is less.
The county is under no obligation to make immediate compensation, but will make compensation if funds are available.
(e)
Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, no credits shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this article, nor shall credit be given for system improvements or funds for system improvements constructed, contributed, or dedicated after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived if an agreement to do so was entered into before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived for projects which have already received a building permit.
(f)
In the event that a feepayor has, under previously established conditions of zoning, constructed, contributed, or dedicated system improvements or funds when receiving permits to proceed with only a portion or phase of a project as defined by a particular zoning case, where the construction, contribution, or dedication is in excess of that required by the portion or phase permitted, the excess construction, contribution, or dedication shall be credited against future development impact fees which shall be required as additional portions or phases of the zoned projects seek building permits.
(g)
The developer must present adequate evidence of the cost and age of the improvement from which present value may be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent), estimates of inflation and depreciation.
(h)
Credits required under subsection (b) of this section, shall be automatically given at the time of fee imposition. Any other credits shall be given only upon request by the developer to the county administrator. To receive consideration for such other credits, a developer must present adequate evidence or proposals for creditable activities and adequate evidence of value to the county administrator at or before the time of application for a building permit.
(i)
The county administrator shall review all claims for allowance and valuation of credits and make determinations regarding:
(1)
Allowance of any claimed credit.
(2)
Value of any allowed credit.
(j)
Any credits shall be acknowledged in writing and calculated at the time of imposition of the development impact fee. A developer may appeal any such determination by following the guidelines established in section 104-497.
