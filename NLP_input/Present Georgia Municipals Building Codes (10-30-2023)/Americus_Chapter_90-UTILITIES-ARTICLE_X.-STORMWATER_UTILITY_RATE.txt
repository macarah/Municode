Sec. 90-601. - Purpose.
This article shall serve the purpose of establishment and set up of the stormwater utility rate structure and billing rate.
(Ord. No. O-10-05-15, ยง 1, 5-20-2010)
Sec. 90-602. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Credit means a reduction in the amount of a customer's stormwater user fee charge in recognition of a customer's efforts to mitigate the stormwater runoff impact that developed property has on the city stormwater management services and systems, and/or the efforts of a customer to offset the city's cost for implementation of stormwater management program (SWMP) activities such as public education, watershed stewardship, etc.
Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, regardless of the type or method of construction, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom, and cooking facilities, designed for occupancy by one or more person(s) regardless of relationship, living as a single-family unit.
Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the stormwater user fee charge billing unit increment related to the median horizontal impervious surface area footprint of 3,000 square feet for a typical single-family dwelling unit within the city.
Manufactured home park means a common development (with a single property owner or entity) of more than one factory-built or prefabricated housing structures that have been partially or entirely assembled at another location and moved into the development.
Nonsingle family residential (NSFR) customer shall mean a utility customer whose property meets the definition of NSFR whether such customer is the owner of the parcel or a tenant of the owner.
Nonsingle family residential (NSFR) property shall mean a developed parcel of land that consists of various nonresidential land uses including, but not limited to: (1) multifamily, commercial (including mixed commercial and residential), office/institutional, public, transportation, industrial, manufacturing and storage buildings and facilities; (2) parking lots, parks, public and private schools, universities and hospitals; (3) streets, roads, water and wastewater treatment plants; and (4) any other form of use not specifically defined as a single-family residential property (SFR).
Single-family residential (SFR) customer means a utility customer of the city residing in a dwelling unit whether such customer is the owner of the dwelling unit, a tenant of the owner of the dwelling unit, or a resident of the dwelling unit.
Single-family residential (SFR) property means developed property containing one residential structure with no more than two dwelling units in or attached thereto, situated upon a single lot of record. Improved property may be classified as SFR even if supplemental accessory structures are present such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in significant additional amounts of impervious surfaces, as determined by the governing body or its designee. SFR properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes and as defined herein; manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes; residential condominium developments with more than two units; or vacant/undeveloped property.
Unless otherwise defined within this article, the definitions included in the stormwater utility enterprise fund ordinance (Code section 90-501 et seq.) are adopted herein by reference.
The professional engineering and financing analysis documents entitled: The Americus SWMP Assessment Funding Feasibility Study (Technical Memorandum, dated June 8, 2009); The Americus SWMP Assessment Funding Feasibility Study Addendum (Technical Memorandum, dated May 20, 2010, or the most recent version); and applicable supporting, project-related documents are incorporated herein by reference.

Sec. 90-603. - Stormwater utility customer classes.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the stormwater utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city SWMP and drainage system components. All state, federal, and county developed properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. The stormwater utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows:
(1)
The single-family residential (SFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as SFR customers per the applicable definition.
(2)
The nonsingle-family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition.
(3)
The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition.
(b)
Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection.

Sec. 90-604. - Stormwater user fee charge rates.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee on all developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater services provided by the city.
(b)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the governing body of the city. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the Office of the City Clerk of Americus. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and together with other funding sources available to the Americus Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management (e.g., credit application fees, plan review fees, development inspection fees, regulatory compliance inspection fees and other fees related to provision of stormwater management services), are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(c)
The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to all developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for all developed properties in the city.
(d)
Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to 3,000 square feet of impervious surface. Gravel and compacted soil driveways, parking areas, and roads on private property will be considered impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. However, the total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 85 percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. Application of the 85 percent factor to these materials is based on applicable literature sources and reference documents outlined herein.
(e)
Calculation of charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be $4.00 multiplied by the number of ERUs for each customer account.
(1)
The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge shall be in general accordance with the following:
a.
SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged 1.0 ERU per month unless one of the conditions outlined below applies.
1.
If two customer accounts are assigned to a SFR property (i.e., a duplex) then each customer account on that parcel will be charged 0.5 ERU per month for billing purposes.
2.
The minimum stormwater user fee charge amount to any eligible customer will be $2.00/ERU/month.
3.
If the SFR property has an impervious surface amount that exceeds 9,000 square feet (or three ERUs) then a customer stormwater user fee bill will be calculated for the customer account using the NSFR user fee charge calculation approach outlined herein.
b.
NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged one ERU for each 3,000 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the number of ERUs for billing each month.
c.
Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall be assigned zero ERUs and will not receive a stormwater user fee bill.
(f)
Stormwater user fee charges shall be billed on the customer's monthly public utility bill (except as stipulated below) starting with the first billing cycle in June 2010 as provided in this article and the stormwater utility enterprise fund ordinance.
(1)
Customers that do not receive a monthly public utility bill from the city shall be billed for stormwater services via another method and frequency established by the city.
(2)
The property owner will be charged for the total impervious surface for residential customer accounts that are part of a larger common development such as multifamily complexes.
(3)
The city shall bill the property owner's tenant for the stormwater user fee charge in situations where the tenant has opened an account with the city for public utility services (i.e., water, sewer, and/or sanitation); provided, however, the property owner shall remain ultimately liable for payment of the stormwater user fee charge imposed on the property. The city shall be authorized to bill the landlord or property owner for stormwater services where accurate and equitable apportionment of the user fee charges to multiple accounts on a site is not practical as determined by the city, and/or to facilitate efficient billing and collection of customer user fee charges.

Sec. 90-605. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions.
(a)
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no developed public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater utility user fee charge is not a tax and no exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management program services and facilities.
(b)
Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(2)
Linear railroad rights-of-way (i.e., tracks, rails, roadbed) outside of the defined yard limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by the railroad company associated with rights-of-way and drainage conveyance systems. However, railroad stations, rail yards, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad operations shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(3)
Sumter County roads and rights-of-way located within the city limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges in situations where Sumter County has legal responsibility to perform all drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities with respect to such roads and rights-of-way. This exemption is in recognition of the drainage system maintenance and capital construction responsibilities undertaken by Sumter County as required in the service delivery strategy dated September 23, 1999. The list of county roads that are exempt from the user fee charges are listed in the service delivery strategy dated September 23, 1999. All other developed property owned by Sumter County shall be subject to the imposition of stormwater user fee charges in accordance with this article.
(4)
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) roads and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way road and drainage conveyance systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other developed property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.

Sec. 90-607. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
The property owner or utility customer account holder, as identified from city public utility billing database information, tax digest and other public records of Sumter County, shall be obligated to pay the applicable stormwater user fee charge.
(1)
Billing.
a.
Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue June 1, 2010, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the stormwater utility customer of the following items (as a minimum): The stormwater user fee charge amount (less any approved credits); the date the payment is due; and the date when payment is past due.
b.
Unless otherwise billed directly to the property owner, the stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected on a common statement and collected along with other city utility services from the person in whose name such services have been placed on account with the city. If and when the account is closed or becomes delinquent, the bills for unpaid previous service as well as for current and future service shall be sent to the property owner.
c.
Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city.
d.
Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be ultimately obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments.
e.
If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed property, the stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to three years, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period.
(2)
Delinquencies and collections.
a.
In addition to any other legal collection remedies provided to the city under state law or local ordinances, unpaid stormwater service fees may be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect any judgment obtain thereby, including, but not limited to, enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. If suit to collect unpaid stormwater service fees is filed and a judgment is rendered in favor of the city in such suit, unless a writ of fieri facias is issued with respect to such judgment, the unpaid stormwater fees shall not constitute a lien against the owner's property where the stormwater services were provided.
b.
A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law and city ordinance provisions. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner.
(3)
Adjustments. The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge.
a.
If a customer believes his stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city.
b.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate impervious area and other supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request.
c.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall within 30 calendar days render a written decision.
d.
In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater user fee charge for the property is correct.
e.
The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
f.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater user fee charge bill.
