Upon demand of the code and ordinance enforcement office such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the county within 30 days.

If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency exists as a result of underreporting, a penalty of ten percent of the deficiency and an additional one percent of the deficiency for each month or fraction thereof that the deficiency was due and unpaid shall be assessed.
