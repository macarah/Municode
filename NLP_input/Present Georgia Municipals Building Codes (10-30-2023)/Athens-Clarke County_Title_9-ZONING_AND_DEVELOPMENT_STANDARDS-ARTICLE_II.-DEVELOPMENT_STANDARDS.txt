Sec. 9-26-1. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of this chapter is to allow subdivision design that has a high level of amenity, while respecting the natural environment, and allowing for a greater choice in housing types and designs. The design should stress a neighborhood centered design, architectural creativity and innovation, use the natural features of the landscape to their greatest advantage, provide a walkable environment, provide for more efficient land use, and reduce the impact of development on the natural environment and neighborhood.

Sec. 9-26-2. - Procedure for approval.
modified
A.
Preliminary plat:
1.
Application for subdivision approval under this chapter shall be accompanied by a proposed preliminary plat. For developments of less than five lots not involving public street construction, only the final plat need be filed, as that term is defined in section 9-26-2 B.4. For developments of five lots or more or for subdivisions of property involving public street construction, a preliminary plat approval is mandatory prior to application for a site review approval and final plat approval.
2.
Any preliminary plat that contains more than ten lots, or covers more than two acres, or contains attached single-family units, or creates lots of less than 8,000 square feet, or creates a residential subdivision with an overall density exceeding 2.5 dwelling units per acre must also receive approval of a site review, chapter 25. Preliminary plat approval shall be obtained prior to filing a site review application. Site review approval shall be obtained prior to filing a final plat application. Preliminary plat approval and site review approval shall follow the staff permit process.
3.
A staff permit procedure, as defined in this title, shall be used for the approval of the preliminary plat.
4.
Contents. The contents for a preliminary plat shall be as follows:
a.
A topographic map prepared by a registered land surveyor at a contour interval as specified by the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance and in accordance with state law.

The staff shall approve the preliminary plat when it finds the following criteria have been met:
a.
That the development meets all applicable ordinance requirements of Athens-Clarke County, and is compatible with the zoning requirements of the zone or zones in which the subdivision will take place.
b.
That adequate key Athens-Clarke County facilities can be provided including water, sewer, paved access to and through the development, electricity, urban storm drainage, and adequate transportation; and that the development will not cause an Athens-Clarke County facility to operate beyond capacity.
c.
That there are adequate provisions for the maintenance of open space and common areas, if required or provided, and that if developments are done in phases that the early phases have the same or higher ratio of amenities as proposed in the entire project.
d.
That the proposed density meets the base and bonus density standards established under the applicable zoning.
e.
That the existing and natural features of the land, such as wetlands, floodplain corridors, ponds, large trees, rock outcroppings, etc., have been identified in the plan of the development and significant features have been included in the open space, common areas, and unbuildable areas.
6.
Approval of the preliminary plat.
a.
The approval authority may approve or disapprove the preliminary plat and application or require changes, or impose conditions of approval that it finds necessary to conform to the standards of this title and the purpose of this chapter. Approval of the preliminary plat and application, and conditions of approval are final to all issues resolved at that time unless appealed.
b.
After a preliminary plat, which has had a public hearing, is approved, the developer may then file a site review application, if required in section 9-26-2-A-2.
c.
If a preliminary plat is phased, 50 percent of the value of the recreational amenities shall be provided in the first phase and all recreational amenities shall be provided when two-thirds of the units are finished.
d.
For subdivisions in RS-5, RS-8, RS-15, RS-25 and RS-40 zones, the following standards apply:

(3)
With the exception of sidewalks, runoff reduction practices, and the top coat of asphalt on street rights-of-way, final plat approval shall be granted only after all required improvements have been installed or constructed and accepted by Athens-Clarke County. The final plat may be approved prior to construction of sidewalks, the top coat of asphalt on street rights-of-way, and completion of any stormwater management facilities associated with current or further phases of the development, provided that a financial guarantee for such improvements has been provided as required in this chapter. No permit for building construction for an individual lot shall be issued until the final plat has been approved.
e.
The approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for three years from the date of preliminary plat approval. If a site review application for the subdivision is required and is not approved within this period, the preliminary plat approval shall expire. If a site review application is not required, the final plat for the subdivision shall be approved within this period or the preliminary plat shall expire. A written request may be filed with the Planning Director at least 30 days before the expiration date for a one-year extension, which shall be granted upon a showing that a good faith attempt has been made to obtain approval of the site review application, if required, or the final plat within the three-year period. Only one such extension shall be allowed.
B.

Sec. 9-26-3. - Street, block, and easement standards.
The following street standards shall apply to developments under this chapter. Assigning of street classifications within each street type shall be established by the Athens-Clarke County Corridor Designations Map.
A.
Street types.
1.
Collector. Any collector street or other street that has an actual or anticipated traffic flow of 800 VTD or greater shall be constructed to the Collector Standards established by the Athens-Clarke County Transportation and Public Works Director.
2.
Commercial street. A commercial street shall conform to the standards for Main Street, Boulevard, or Parkway Corridor or other street types that have been adopted by the Athens-Clarke County Commission.
3.
Residential streets. Residential streets are all other streets in a residential subdivision. The width of the street shall depend on the street design, the amount of on street parking required, and the number of units served. The residential street shall be developed from the following components:
EXPAND
Vehicular travel area, measured from edge of pavement 20 feet
Sidewalk 5 feet
Tree planting area 5 feet
Utility area, total both sides 15 feet
Parking lane, parallel 7 feet

Rural Local 60 ft. 30 ft. AR zones, and RS zones where county sewer is not available. Sidewalk on one-side; off-street parking only.
  6.
Private drive. A private drive is a private road, which serves three or less dwelling units and/or non-residential establishments. No curbs or sidewalks are required for a private drive. The private drive standard is as follows:
Three units: 20 feet of improved width with 25 feet dedicated easement width.
Two units: 15 feet of improved width with 20 feet dedicated easement width.
One unit: Ten feet of improved width with 20 feet dedicated easement width.
7.
Private street. A private street is a private road that serves four or more dwelling units and/or non-residential establishments. A private street shall be constructed to the same standards as a public street.
B.
Dedicated public streets required. All roads which serve four units or greater, and which are in an "RS" or "RM" zone, must be dedicated to the public and shall be developed to improvement standards established by the Athens-Clarke County Transportation and Public Works Department. Public streets may not be gated or barred from use by the general public. All roads that serve less than four units shall be paved to alley standards established by the transportation and public works department.
C.
Dead ends and cul-de-sacs. Only residential streets may be dead end roads, and may not serve more than 19 units. No dead end road shall exceed 500 feet in length, not including the turnaround. Dead end roads must terminate in an improved turnaround as defined in the development standards of the Athens-Clarke County Public Works Department. Roads that are temporary dead ends, that are shown on the transportation corridor concept map, are exempt from these requirements, but must provide a temporary turnaround. These requirements may also be waived for proposed temporary dead ends not shown on the transportation corridor concept map when determined as necessary by the planning director for reasonable future access to adjacent property.
D.
Reserve strips. Reserve strips or street plugs shall be created to control access onto any street which terminates upon any undeveloped land through which the street might logically extend. In such cases, the street shall be provided to within one foot of the boundary line of the tract with the remaining one foot being granted in fee to Athens-Clarke County as a reserve strip. Upon approved dedication of the extension of the affected street, the one-foot reserve strip shall be dedicated by Athens-Clarke County to the public use as a part of said street. This dedication will be automatic and without further action by the Athens-Clarke County. This action shall also apply retroactively to all previously created reserve strips where the streets have been extended and dedicated for street purposes.
E.
Alignment. All streets as far as is practical shall be in alignment with the existing streets by continuation of the centerlines thereof. The staggering of street alignment resulting in "T" intersections shall wherever practical leave a minimum distance of 125 feet between the centerlines of streets.
F.
Future extension of streets. Where necessary to give access to or permit a satisfactory subdivision of adjoining land, streets shall be extended to the boundary of the subdivision and the resulting dead-end streets may be approved without a turnaround. Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions.
G.
Intersection angles. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at an angle as near to a right angle as practical, except where topography requires a lesser angle. Intersection angles shall be no less than 75 degrees and no greater than 105 degrees as measured in any direction from the intersection. Property lines at intersections shall have a minimum radius or miter 20 feet at streets and ten feet at the intersection between a street and alley.
H.
Existing streets. Whenever existing streets adjacent to or within a tract are of inadequate width, additional right-of-way shall be provided at the time of subdivision.
I.
Access to subdivision. All major means of access to a subdivision or major partition shall be from existing streets fully improved to Athens-Clarke County standards, and which, in judgment of the transportation and public works director, have the capacity to carry all anticipated traffic from the development.
J.
Half streets. Half streets, while generally not acceptable, may be approved when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision, when in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and when the hearings board finds it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street may be platted within such tract. Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of the half streets.
K.
Street names. Proposed street names shall meet the criteria established by section 9-15-27(A).
L.
Streets adjacent to railroad rights-of-way. Wherever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, provision may be required for a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the land between the streets and the railroad. The distance shall be great enough to provide sufficient depth to allow screen planting along the railroad right-of-way.
M.
Alleys. Alleys shall be encouraged in developments that have lots of 8,000 square feet or less. They shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts, unless other permanent provisions for access to off-street parking and loading facilities are made, as approved by the planning director. No unpaved alleys shall be allowed. Alleys shall be paved to a minimum width of 16 feet or 12 feet with a minimum two-foot all-weather shoulder on each side. The minimum easement of an alley shall be no less than 24 feet in width.
N.
Street grade. Street grades, measured at the street centerline for dedicated streets and private roads, shall be as follows:
1.
Public street and private street grades shall not exceed the following maximum grades:
EXPAND
Residential Commercial/Industrial
Local street = 15% Local street = 12%
Collector street = 12% Collector street = 10%
Arterial street = 10% Arterial street = 8%
  2.
Private drives serving structures greater than 24 feet in height shall provide a fire work area of 20 feet by 40 feet within 50 feet of the structure. The fire work area requirement shall be waived if the structure served by the drive has an approved automatic sprinkler system installed. Private drives and work areas shall be deemed fire lanes and subject to all requirements thereof.
O.
Blocks.
1.
General. The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be designed with due regard to providing building sites for the use contemplated, consideration of needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic, and recognition of the limitations and opportunities of topography.
2.
Sizes. Blocks shall conform to the following maximum dimensions, unless the planning director determines topographical conditions or manmade barriers justify an exception. The block dimensions shall be measured between minimum 50-foot-wide street rights-of-way. Minimum 50-foot-wide open space areas can also be used for block separations when approved by the planning director.
EXPAND

RS-5, RM 3 acres 500 feet
  3.
Block width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots. Single-tier lots and through lots shall be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major traffic arteries or adjacent nonresidential activities, where located adjacent to the external boundary of the development, or where the planning director determines such lots to be necessary to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen, developed to the standards contained in section 9-15-3, "buffer requirements," across which there shall be no right of vehicular access, shall be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or nonresidential use. Lots with required planting screens shall meet the minimum lot depth, excluding the planting screen area.
P.
Easements.
1.
Utility lines. Easements for sewers, water mains, electric lines, or other public utilities shall be dedicated wherever necessary. The easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width.
2.
Streams. All subdivisions shall comply with Chapter 8-6, "Protected Environmental Areas."
3.
Pedestrian ways. When desirable for public convenience, pedestrian ways may be required to connect to cul-de-sacs, to pass through oddly-shaped or unusually long blocks, or to provide access to schools, parks, or other public areas.
4.
Exception for commercial and industrial blocks. Where property is zoned and planned for industrial or business use, such subdivisions shall be exempt from the block size and length standards of this section.
Q.
Streets which interconnect to local and collector residential streets outside of the subject subdivision require review and approval of the proposed interconnection as a special use following Type II procedures. The exception to this requirement is in those instances where an existing reserve strip has been constructed or is located on the preliminary plat or final plat on the adjacent subdivision as filed with the Athens-Clarke County Planning Department.

Sec. 9-26-4. - Parking standards for residential subdivisions.
Parking standards shall be as follows:
A.
Off-street parking. Off-street parking space shall be as provided in chapter 9-30 of this title.
B.
On-street parking required. At least one on-street parking space per two units shall be provided in addition to the off-street parking requirements for all residential or mixed-use subdivisions of five lots or more, except that in the A-R, RS-15, RS-25, and RS-40 zoning districts, no on-street parking shall be required if the lots are at least 75 feet in width. No on-street parking shall be required on streets with a functional classification of minor collector if the posted speed in the area of the development is above 35 mph (miles per hour), or on streets with a functional classification of a major collector or arterial. If the posted speed on a minor collector is less than 35 mph, but there are physical difficulties in the provision of adequate on-street parking due to vertical or horizontal curvature, the planning director may waive the requirement for on-street parking on the recommendation of the Department of Transportation and Public Works Director. On-street parking spaces shall be immediately adjacent to the public street on publicly or homeowners association-owned land and be directly accessible from public right-of-way streets. On-street parking spaces shall be located within 200 feet of the use that they are intended to serve.
C.
On-street parking standards. On-street public parking may be provided providing spaces parallel to curb side or by providing diagonal parking in bays. Curbside stalls shall be seven feet in width and 24 feet in length and shall not be permitted in front of driveways or fire hydrants.

(1)
Improvement guarantees. The subdivider may provide improvement guarantees and deed and easement documents, as defined in these regulations, at the time of application for final subdivision approval in an amount approved by the department of public works and department of public utilities as sufficient to secure to the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County the satisfactory construction, installation and dedication of the uncompleted portion of required improvements. Guarantees shall be structured to permit periodic demands for payment from the issuer in whole or in part for the entire amount of the credit. Such improvement guarantees shall be approved by the department of public works and/or department of public utilities as to amount and surety and can be renewed for a period not to exceed one year.
(2)
The original bond or letter of credit will be kept on file with the finance department.

Failure to complete improvements. In those cases where an improvement guarantee has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such guarantees, Athens-Clarke County shall call the improvement guarantee due and collect all funds or require that all the improvements be immediately installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the improvement guarantee is declared to be in default. If the director of public works and director of public utilities find upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with Athens-Clarke County construction standards and specifications, the subdivider shall be responsible for removing any defects and completing the improvements or forfeiting the guarantee.
(6)
Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of all public street rights-of-way, drainage and utility easements, and public areas shall be made in writing by the public works director and/or public utilities director who shall notify the mayor and commission of Athens-Clarke County of said action. The approval and recording by the planning department of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by Athens-Clarke County of any street, right-of-way, easement or public area shown on said plat.

Inspection of improvements:
(1)
General procedure. Athens-Clarke County shall provide for inspection of required improvements during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion.

Prior to dedication of improvements, the applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond with Athens-Clarke County in an amount considered adequate by the department of public works or the department of public utilities in a form satisfactory to the Athens-Clarke County Attorney. The maintenance bond shall assure the satisfactory condition of the required street improvement and drainage for a period of one year after the date of acceptance of the right-of-way by the public works director and the public utilities director.
d.
Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy. Where an improvement guarantee has been required for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the approval of the department of public works and department of public utilities of all improvements of that phase of the subdivision.
4.
The time period for completion shall not exceed one year. Following expiration of the allowed time period, failure to complete may be met by Athens-Clarke County completing the work as specified above, or by voiding of the final plat. The course chosen shall depend on the stage of completion, if any, and the nature of the surrounding area. The decision regarding completion or plat voiding shall be made by the transportation and public works director.
C.

3.
Any change in use of all or part of an existing development of one or more buildings from a nonresidential use to a residential use that has at least five (5) dwelling units.
B.
Number of inclusionary units. To calculate the number of inclusionary dwelling units or lots, the total number of proposed units shall be multiplied by the associated percentage identified in Section 9-27-5.

The phasing plan shall provide for development of the inclusionary units concurrently with the market rate units; provided, however, that the phasing plan may be adjusted by the director of the Planning Department away from strict concurrency where necessary in order to account for the different financing and funding environments, economies of scale, and infrastructure needs applicable to development of the market rate and the inclusionary units.
E.
Design, appearance, and size. Inclusionary units shall be:
1.
Indistinguishable from the market rate units in infrastructure (including sewer, water and other utilities); construction quality; interior and exterior design; and all aspects of construction, design, and materials;

Sec. 9-27-7. - Payment in lieu alternative.
new
A.
Under this option, qualifying projects in the CD (Commercial Downtown) zoning district may choose to make a payment in lieu of providing affordable units on-site. The payment in lieu amount shall be the product of: the number of affordable units required under option A above, multiplied by a per-unit figure, which shall be determined from time to time by the Mayor and Commission, based on the estimated cost of constructing the mandated units. In other zoning districts, payments in lieu are available only in lieu of any required fractional percentage of a required affordable unit, in place of rounding up to the next whole number. The per-unit payment amount set by the Mayor and Commission shall be located in its Schedule of Fees and Charges pursuant to Section 2-6-2. The County Manager shall establish a housing fund for the receipt and management of in-lieu housing fees. Monies received into the fund shall be utilized solely for the construction or purchase and maintenance of affordable housing and for the costs of administering programs consistent with the purposes of this section.
B.
Payment in lieu fees must be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for the development. For phased developments, payments may be made for each portion of the development prior to the issuance of a building permit for that phase.

(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 6-5-2001, § 21)
Sec. 9-30-8. - Limitations, location, use of facilities.
A.
Location. Except for single and two-family dwellings, required parking facilities may be located on another parcel of land, provided said parcel is within 200 feet of the use it is intended to serve. The distance from the parking lot to the use shall be measured in walking distance from the nearest parking space to an access to the building housing the use, along a sidewalk or other pedestrian path separated from street traffic. Such right to use the off-site parking must be evidenced by an agreement such as a deed, lease, easement, or similar written instrument establishing such use, for the duration of the use.
An attested copy of such agreement among the owners of record shall be submitted to the Planning Director who shall forward a copy to the Athens-Clarke County Attorney for review. The agreement shall be filed and indexed in the deed records of the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Athens-Clarke County by the owner. Proof of recordation of the agreement shall be presented to the Planning Director. The agreement shall require that the Planning Director be notified prior to the expiration, termination, or modification of the agreement and be informed by the applicant on July 1 of each year on the status of this lease agreement.
If the agreement is cancelled, expires or is otherwise voided, other parking shall be provided in accordance with this chapter. If the required parking is not provided for any use covered by the former agreement, such use shall be illegal.
The agreement shall accompany a parking plan (drawn to scale showing location of uses, location and size of parking spaces, pedestrian access, and other relevant information), proof that the uses sharing parking do not have overlapping hours of operation, and a calculation of the parking required for each use based upon the provisions of this chapter.
B.
Except for single-family dwellings, required parking shall not be located in a required front and side street yard setback area abutting a public street, except alleys.
C.
Mixed uses. In the event that several users occupy a single structure or parcel of land, the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the requirements for the several uses computed separately unless it can be shown that the peak parking demands are offset, for example with retail and residential, or theater and office uses. In such case the planning director may reduce the total requirements accordingly, but not by more than 25 percent.
D.
Joint use of facilities. Required parking facilities of two or more uses, structures, or parcels of land may be satisfied by the same parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that it can be shown by the owners or operators that the need for the facilities does not materially overlap (e.g., uses primarily of a daytime v. nighttime nature) and provided that such right of joint use is evidenced by a deed, lease, contract, or similar written instrument establishing such joint use.
E.
Availability of facilities. Required parking shall be available for parking of operable passenger vehicles of residents, customers and employees only, and shall not be used for the storage or display of vehicles or materials. In all residential zones except AR (Agricultural Residential), all off-street parking of automobiles, trucks, trailers and recreational vehicles in the front yard or side yard when adjacent to the public right-of-way shall be limited to a contiguous area which is no more than 25 percent of the area of the front yard, or a contiguous area equivalent to the square footage calculation of 18 feet wide multiplied by the depth in feet of the front yard, whichever is greater. The calculation of such area shall include both driveway and parking areas. Such parking area shall be paved with pervious or impervious concrete or asphalt, or graveled if edged in a permanent fashion. Contiguous front yard parking areas serving two or more lots that are accessed by a shared drive must be screened from the right-of-way according to the standards set forth in section 9-30-9 E.6.a. Parking areas constructed after the effective date of this paragraph that do not meet the paving or graveling requirements set forth herein or that are in excess of the size restriction set forth herein shall be a violation of this title. Parking areas paved with pervious or impervious surfaces or graveled with permanent edging which existed prior to the effective date of this paragraph that are rendered non-conforming by the area restrictions of this paragraph shall be subject to the provisions governing non-conforming uses of section 9-15-8.
F.
Off-Street Parking in Residential zones. In all residential zones except for the AR (Agricultural-Residential) it shall be unlawful for any person to park or place an automobile, truck, trailer, or recreational vehicle on a non-prepared, unimproved surface that does not meet the paving or graveling requirements set forth in section 9-30-8 E. in a front yard or side yard of property adjacent to a public right-of-way. For purposes of this paragraph F., it shall also be unlawful for a person owning or occupying property in said residential zones to allow the parking or placing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, or recreational vehicles on a non-prepared, unimproved surface that does not meet the paving or graveling requirements set forth in section 9-30-8 E. in a front yard or side yard of property adjacent to a public right-of-way.
G.
Transportation Policy Statement. A transportation policy statement shall accompany proposals for additions or other new facilities, such as parking lot expansions, for fraternities, sororities, semi-public halls, clubs, and lodges. The policy statement is intended to raise awareness with respect to traffic impact and to reduce demand for parking and the frequency of single-occupancy vehicle trips by promoting a range of viable commuting alternatives, including public transit, bicycling, walking, and carpooling. The Transportation Policy Statement would include the following at a minimum:
1.
Outline the alternative transportation program (including public transit, bicycling, walking, and rideshare/carpooling) for chapter meetings and special events. During the plans review process the applicant will submit the proper documentation in order for Staff to determine if applicant is providing realistic, adequate mitigation and accountability for the impact that their chapter meeting and special events have on the surrounding neighborhoods.
2.
Acknowledge how many full-time residents are permitted to park onsite. This number cannot exceed 80% of the provided spaces onsite.
