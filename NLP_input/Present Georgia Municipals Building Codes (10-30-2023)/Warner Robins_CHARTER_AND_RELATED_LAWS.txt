Said revenue refunding bonds may be issued at any time not more than 15 years prior to the date that the refunded bonds are to be retired, either at maturity or pursuant to a call for redemption or both. Pending the retirement of the revenue bonds being refunded, the city shall deposit a sufficient portion of the proceeds of such revenue refunding bonds, together with any other legally available funds, in escrow to pay principal, interest, and redemption premiums on the revenue bonds to be refunded, and some or all money so deposited may be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America or any of its agencies or in obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States of America. In determining the sufficiency of such deposit, the city may include interest to be received on such investments.
(b)
The city shall, upon depositing in escrow the proceeds of any revenue refunding bonds hereunder, enter into an agreement with the bank holding such deposit. Said agreement shall require said bank, among other things, to hold the investments and liquidate the same without further instructions from the city when necessary to pay principal, interest, and redemption premiums on the revenue bonds refunded and may require such bank to publish on behalf of the city one or more notices of redemption of the revenue bonds to be refunded.
(c)
The validity of revenue refunding bonds issued hereunder may be determined by proceedings in the Superior Court of Houston County, Georgia. Such proceedings shall be brought and conducted, may be intervened in, may be appealed from in the same manner, and shall have the same effect as is provided in the Revenue Bond Law. If the aforementioned agreement governing the deposit of revenue refunding bond proceeds is attached as an exhibit to the resolution authorizing said revenue refunding bonds, the court upon validation shall determine the validity of said agreement as well as the validity of said revenue refunding bonds.
(d)
Such revenue refunding bonds shall constitute investment securities under Title 11 of the O.C.G.A., the "Uniform Commercial Code," but no financing statement nor continuation statement need be filed to protect or perfect the interest of the holders of said revenue refunding bonds in the revenues pledged to their payment. Such revenue refunding bonds may be secured by a pledge of all or any portion of the revenues to be derived from the operation of one or more revenue-producing facilities of the city, after payment of the reasonable and necessary expenses of operation and maintenance, and such revenues need not be limited to revenues pledged to the revenue bonds refunded. Revenue refunding bonds shall not be payable from or charged upon any funds other than the revenues pledged to the payment thereof, nor shall the city be subject to any pecuniary liability thereon. No holder or holders of any such revenue refunding bonds shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the city to pay any such revenue refunding bonds or the interest thereof, nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of the city; nor shall any such bonds constitute a lien upon any property of the city. Each bond issued under this section shall contain a recital setting forth the substance of this subsection.
(e)
Revenue refunding bonds issued hereunder or the resolution providing for their issuance may contain such provisions for the security of said revenue refunding bonds as the governing body may determine, including such covenants and rights to a receiver upon default as are provided for in the Revenue Bond Law, and may be issued in one or more series; may be sold in such manner; may bear such date or dates; may mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates; may bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding 9 percent per annum and payable at such time or times; may be payable in such medium of payment at such place or places; may be in such denomination or denominations; may be in such form either coupon or registered; may carry such registration, conversion, and exchangeability privileges; may be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium; may be declared or become due before the maturity date thereof; may be executed in such manner; and may contain such terms, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution or resolutions authorizing the issuance of such bonds may provide. All bonds issued under this section bearing the signature of officers in office on the date of the signing thereof shall be valid and binding, notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof, and payment therefor, such officers whose signatures appear thereon shall have ceased to be officers of the municipality issuing the same. Pending the preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts, in such form and with such provisions as the governing body may determine, may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of bonds to be issued under this section. Said bonds shall be and are hereby declared to be nontaxable for any and all purposes.
(f)
This section shall be deemed cumulative and not in lieu of all other laws granting bond authority to the city and shall provide an additional but nonexclusive means of refunding revenue bonds of the city, regardless of the law under which the revenue bonds shall have been issued.

(l)
The city shall classify its enterprise funds' net assets as restricted, unrestricted, or invested in capital assets.
