ARTICLE 4. - COMMERCIAL AND MIXED-USE DISTRICTS

Sec. 4.01. - General provisions.
A.
The intent of the commercial and mixed use districts is to protect established commercial and mixed use areas as well as promote well designed and properly located future developments that create minimal impact on adjacent, incompatible districts.
B.
The district provisions discourage any use that would substantially interfere with the retail, service or office function of the districts. Compatible park, open space, utility and civic uses as well as integrated residential dwelling units are permitted in commercial and mixed use districts as identified in article 2, uses, use regulations and restrictions.
Sec. 4.02. - Interpretation.
The following graphics depict the interpretation of lot development standards. The official definitions for these terms can be found in the article 12, definitions.

  Sec. 4.03. - PUD planned unit development.
A.
Purpose. The purpose of a planned unit development is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development, rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and flexibility in design. Approval of an overall concept plan by the city council provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in accordance with the land use plan and the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located.
It is anticipated that a pattern of creative and innovative neighborhood development, including residential and neighborhood commercial, will be developed that is distinguished from other residential zoning districts through a diversity of lot sizes, housing types and sizes to accommodate persons of a variety of stages of life in a pedestrian-oriented setting that is well integrated with the city's neighborhoods, parks, civic spaces, and supportive services.

Each PUD development is anticipated to include a mix of land uses as identified in the table below. The intent of allowing non-residential uses is to create a node of neighborhood oriented retail and services primarily for the convenience of those in and directly adjacent to the PUD district. Non-residential development must be at a scale and type that is compatible with the residential component of the development.

Minimum of 50% of common areas specifically used for passive parks, greenways, multi-use paths, or public squares/greens Additional 0.5 dwelling units per acre
  E.
Open space required; common area standards.
1.
Within the PUD, 20 percent of the gross land area must be set aside as common area open space, half of which must be usable for active or passive recreation.
2.
The common and open space areas and facilities shall be held in common by a legally constituted association of property owners with the financial capability to maintain the open space and shall be on a recorded plat as permanent common area open space for the use of residents, workers, patrons and visitors to the development.
3.
For the purposes of calculation, common open space does not include any streets or public rights-of-way, or yard areas or landscape areas located on private property. Common open space does include land and water areas that are available to all occupants of the PUD on a continuing and permanent basis, such as walking trails, community centers or clubhouses, golf courses and other recreation areas, protected flood plains or wetlands.
4.
Lands dedicated to an approved public use, such as a school or fire station, shall be credited as part of the 20 percent common open space requirement.
5.
Each common area or open space must comprise a contiguous area of at least 3,000 square feet.

Maintained by the city if common areas are accepted by the city as a part of a final development agreement; or
b.
By a mandatory property owner's association which shall be responsible for ownership, operation, maintenance and insurance of all land and facilities within the common areas of the development.
F.
PUD perimeter compatibility. Land uses developed at the perimeter of the site shall be developed in a manner that is compatible with adjacent off-site land uses or zoning, or a 100-foot wide buffer shall be provided between the uses in the PUD and the perimeter of the site. Compatibility shall be judged on the basis of similar land uses, average lot sizes, setbacks, and other development standards.
G.
Submission requirements.
1.
Concept plan required, development standards.
a.
Development of the PUD shall be guided by a graphic concept plan that designates the land uses of the PUD. The concept plan may be accompanied by a development standards text, which may be approved as a condition of zoning or special use, providing development standards and uses for the project which vary, augment or limit the requirements of this UDO.
b.
To the extent that the approved concept plan and development standards for a PUD contradict the UDO, the contradictory provisions of the UDO are inapplicable to that PUD. For properties zoned to design concept development (DCD) before the effective date of this UDO, to the extent that development standards are not stated with regard to a particular land use or area, then the standards in the UDO applicable to the zoning district most consistent with the DCD approval for that land use or area shall apply, provided such standards do not contradict the concept plan for the DCD. For properties zoned to PUD on or after the effective date of this UDO, to the extent that development standards are not stated with regard to a particular area, then the standards and land uses required and permitted in the area shall be those allowed for the zoning district designated on the concept plan.
2.
Concept plan as a condition of zoning. No changes in land use or density shall be allowed in any approved and incorporated concept plan or development standards text, except as subsequently approved pursuant to a rezoning of the property. For properties zoned to DCD concurrent with adoption of the official zoning map on the effective date of this UDO, and for which development has commenced but is not complete prior to the effective date of this UDO, the individual land use plan for any such property shall serve as a concept plan, and such property shall continue to be developed in accordance with development standards applicable at the time of adoption of the land use plan, unless and until new individualized development standards are approved for such property by the mayor and city council. For all properties zoned to PUD subsequent to the effective date of this UDO, the land uses permitted within a DCD and the development standards applicable to each, by location, shall be established as a condition of approval by the city council at the time that the property is rezoned to PUD.
3.
Traffic study required. The applicant shall submit a traffic study along with the zoning application for any property which:
a.
Has an existing zoning classification other than DCD, and for which the applicant seeks PUD zoning; or
b.
Is already zoned as DCD, and for which the applicant seeks a change or addition to the concept plan, development text or special stipulations, or an initial adoption of any such elements.
The report shall comply with the provisions of section 10.06.H., traffic study.

b.
Type B—Stucco, wood and other materials listed as type A.
c.
Type C—Finished concrete, glazed surface, metal (not corrugated or unfinished) and other material listed as type A or type B.

Multi-dwelling calculation. For any PUD development approved on or after the effective date of this UDO, as an alternative to the requirements of paragraph 1. of this subsection, the development text may specify façade materials for all detached residential dwellings conforming to one of the following plans:
a.
80 percent plan. Where every residential dwelling in the PUD development has a minimum lot size of 8,000 square feet, and a minimum dwelling size of 1,500 square feet, and where the maximum density is four units per acre, the development text may provide for:
1)
Not fewer than 80 percent of the total number of dwellings each to have not less than 80 percent brick façade on each and every side, and
2)
The remaining dwellings to have type C façade material.
b.
50 percent plan. Where every residential dwelling in the PUD development has a minimum lot size of 9,000 square feet, and a minimum dwelling size of 1,700 square feet, and where the maximum density is three and one-half units per acre, the development text may provide for:
