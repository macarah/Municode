(Ord. of 6-21-11)
Sec. 13-32. - Promotions.
(a)
Promotions to another classification.
(1)
Each department head, based on the requirements of each department, shall establish a promotion plan for the promotion of employees to higher and different job classifications. All such plans shall be approved by the county administrator, shall provide equal opportunities for promotion to all employees without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, creed, ancestry, physical handicap, age or political affiliation, and give due consideration to each employee's qualifications, demonstration of skill, experience and fitness for promotion under consideration.
(2)
The promotion of employees to higher positions out of their current classification shall be done in compliance with the recruitment and selection provisions of division 4 hereof.
(b)
Re-classification of existing position.
(1)
Each department head shall establish a plan for the re-classification of their employees to a higher graded position within the same classification. Qualifications such as experience, education, and/or certifications should be established and published by the department head as requirements for consideration for a re-classification. Within department re-classification must be covered by the department's approved salary budget and therefore, will attach a statement from the Finance Department that the re-classification will not require additional salary finances. Examples of re-classifications are as follows, but not limited to: appraiser trainee to appraiser; maintenance worker to maintenance technician I; operator trainee to operator I; accounting trainee to accountant; firefighter II to firefighter II/EMT; jailer I to jailer II; equipment operator I to equipment operator II; secretary to senior secretary; mechanic I to mechanic II, etc.
Employees will not be recommended for a re-classification during their initial probationary period and re-classifications will normally be restricted to one within a two-year period. Department heads will submit the requested re-classification with complete justification, documentation, and a statement from finance, to the human resources director. The HR director will verify all information within the packet and will submit the request to the county administrator for approval. These re-classification promotions will not create a vacancy within the department but will move the employee and the position they occupy to a higher rated position within the department.
(2)
All re-classifications will be considered using the equal opportunity requirements.
(Ord. of 4-18-97; Ord. of 6-21-11)
