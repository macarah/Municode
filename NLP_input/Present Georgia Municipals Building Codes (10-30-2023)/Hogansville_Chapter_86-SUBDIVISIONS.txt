(1)
Street base and paving requirements shall be in accordance with city or state requirements.
(2)
Where a public sanitary sewer is within 400 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point and connection by gravity flow is feasible, the subdivider shall connect with such sanitary sewer and provide a connection for each lot.

A maintenance bond or other surety shall be furnished to the city which shall name the city as a principal equally with the owner and shall be worded to include in its coverage a one-year maintenance warranty period following acceptance of the improvements by the city.

(1)
Requirements. To ensure the construction and installation of required improvements, the subdivider shall deliver to the city council a certified check, surety bond and other acceptable security in such aggregate amount as is estimated by the city council to be the total cost of the construction and installation of all public improvements which are the responsibility of the subdivider.
(2)
Conditions. Bond or other surety posted shall run to the city and provide that the subdivider, his heirs or successors and assigns, and their agents and servants, will comply with applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of this chapter and any other applicable requirements; will faithfully perform and complete the work of constructing and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with this chapter and any other applicable requirements; and that the subdivider shall be responsible to the city for any unnecessary expense incurred through the failure of the subdivider, his heirs, successors and assigns, or their agent or servants, to complete the work of such construction in an acceptable manner, and from any damage growing out of negligence in performing or failing to perform such construction and installation. Before acceptance, any surety shall be approved by the city. If a bond is offered, it shall be executed by a surety or guaranty company qualified to transact business in the state.
(3)
Duration and release. Bond and/or other surety posted pursuant to this chapter shall be released or returned, as the case may be, at such time as the facilities guaranteed thereby have been installed and accepted. Acceptances shall be in writing accurately identifying the improvements covered. Facilities shall not be accepted unless they conform to the applicable city specifications and requirements and have been maintained by the developer for a period of one year.
(4)
Default. If the construction or installation of any improvements or facilities for which a bond or other surety is posted is not completed within three months after substantial completion of any building or structure which such improvements or facilities are designed to serve, or within two years after the date of recording of the final plat, whichever is sooner, or if such construction or installation is not in accordance with the applicable specifications and requirements, then the proceeds from such surety deposits shall be used to pay for such work. Such work may be done under contract or by the city personnel. To the extent that any portion of a cash deposit is not required or used, such excess cash shall be repaid to the person making the deposit.
(5)
Certification of receipt of surety for required improvements. The following form shall be printed directly on the final plat as follows, where a final plat is recorded subsequent to the installation of the required improvements:

ARTICLE IX. - ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

Sec. 86-261. - Variances and waivers.
(a)
Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary and unnecessary hardships may result from strict compliance with this chapter, it may recommend a variance to the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that such variations will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the master plan, or the zoning ordinance (chapter 102), if any or all of such exists.
(b)
Where the planning commission finds that, due to the special circumstances of a particular plat, the provision of certain required improvements is not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare or is inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities adjacent or in proximity to the proposed subdivision, it may recommend waiver of such requirements subject to appropriate conditions.
(c)
In granting variances and modifications, the mayor and council shall consider the recommendations of the planning commission, and shall require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.

(2)
Office and commercial uses shall be located adjacent to major thoroughfares or in other areas with suitable access that will not result in traffic through residential areas.

(4)
Location of land uses should conform substantially with land use plan goals, policies and suggested types of uses.
(5)
Street lengths, alignments, patterns and other characteristics should conform to city subdivision regulations or standard planning principles.

For developments that are predominantly residential, only limited commercial uses of up to ten percent of the total development site area can be of a retail nature.
(8)
The commercial and retail portion of predominantly residential developments shall be limited to uses not onerous to the residential development. These commercial uses shall be limited to those that do not affect the traffic volume or the character and nature of traffic, i.e., no trucks or vehicles with more than two axles. Commercial uses within these predominately residential areas shall be limited to those uses that do not produce waste that cannot be handled by a standard solid waste handler.
