Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2
Sec. 62-33. - Regulations for billboards.
(a)
All billboards must be located in such a way as to protect the scenic views of the county. Billboards should be placed on the side of knolls, mountains and ridges so as not to obstruct open and long-distance scenic views.
(b)
No billboards shall be located within 1,000 feet of a church, public park, public playground, public recreation area, public forest, or cemetery.
(c)
No individual billboard shall exceed an area of 288 square feet per face. Only one sign face shall be allowed to face the same direction per location. This allows back-to-back and V formation billboards but prohibits two sign faces side-by-side or over and under each other facing the same direction. This does not prohibit multiple face billboards that only project one face at a time in one direction as further regulated in this article.
(d)
Only freestanding billboards shall be allowed. No off-premises signs may be fastened to trees or utility poles.
(e)
No billboards shall be permitted within one mile of any other billboard on either side of the roadway.
(f)
Billboards shall not exceed 30 feet in height. Billboard height shall be measured from the elevation of the road surface of the nearest roadway to the highest point on the billboard. Measurements shall be taken from the nearest edge of the traveled way, perpendicular from the location of the proposed billboard.
(g)
The setback shall be 25 feet from the edge of any traveled way of any road.
(h)
Billboards shall be required to have the required DOT permit and must conform to all applicable regulations of O.C.G.A. § 32-6-1 et seq., which provides for the maintenance and use of public roads and control of outdoor advertising, and any other state or federal laws which may apply. Billboard owners and applicants for billboard permits shall be held to having knowledge of all state and federal regulations, and in no event shall the governing authority or any agent or employee of the governing authority be liable in any way for issuing a permit which is later found to violate state or federal regulations.
(i)
No trees shall be cut along any right-of-way on any county road before or after locating, placing or erecting a billboard, except where a legal permit has been obtained from the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(j)
No billboard shall be erected or maintained in such a manner as to be a hazard or a nuisance. Billboards may not be erected which would obstruct the view of motorists entering or exiting roads or highways or interfering with a driver's view of traffic.
(k)
Illumination shall be limited to one light per face. No illuminated billboard shall give off light which glares, blinds, or has any such adverse effect on traffic. The light from illuminated billboards shall be established in such a way that adjacent residences and roadways are not adversely affected and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent residences and roadways.
(l)
If illuminated, billboards which contain, include, or are illuminated by any flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights except those giving public service information such as time, date, temperature, weather, or other similar information are prohibited. The illumination of mechanical multiple message signs may not be illuminated by flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights, at any time, while rotating or in a fixed position.
(m)
Each billboard owner shall make available without cost for county or community public messages any unsold faces which have remained blank for more than six months.
(n)
Billboards which display untrue or false statements, or advertise or encourage any material or activity which is illegal, or which depicts any material which is obscene as such term is defined in O.C.G.A. ch. 16-12, or defined by federal law are prohibited. In accordance with Georgia law, outdoor advertising containing depictions of nudity or sexual conduct which are visible from the roadways of public roads may be startling or provocative and thereby divert the attention of motor vehicle drivers, thus causing real and substantial hazards to traffic safety. Union County declares that the purpose of this section is to protect the public welfare and safety against such hazards, and therefore no person or entity shall display any outdoor advertising containing any depiction of nudity or sexual conduct, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 32-6-52, when such depiction is visible from the roadway of any public road in the state highway system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 32-4-1.
(o)
Animated billboards or billboards with any moving, swinging, or sound-producing elements are prohibited, except that billboards with rotating faces that only project one face at a time in one direction may be allowed.
(p)
Multiple message signs shall be permitted on primary highways, and other highways under the following conditions:
(1)
Each multiple message sign shall remain fixed for at least ten seconds;
(2)
When a message is changed mechanically, it shall be accomplished in three seconds or less;
(3)
No such multiple message sign shall be placed within 5,000 feet of another mechanical multiple message sign on the same side of the highway;
(4)
Any such sign shall contain a default design that will freeze the sign in one position if a malfunction occurs;
(5)
Any maximum size limitations shall apply independently to each side of a multiple message sign; and
(6)
Nonmechanical electronic multiple message signs that are otherwise in compliance with this subsection and are illuminated entirely by the use of light emitting diodes, back lighting, or any other light source shall be permitted under the following circumstances:
a.
Each transitional change occurs within two seconds;
b.
If the department finds an electronic sign or any display or effect thereon to cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or to otherwise interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle, then, upon the department's request, the owner of the sign shall promptly and within not more than 48 hours reduce the intensity of the sign to a level acceptable to the department; and
c.
If a multiple message sign on a primary highway or other highway is in violation of any of the above conditions, its permit shall be revoked and the sign shall be removed. During the appeal of any violations of this section, the sign shall remain fixed until the matter is resolved.

Every billboard constructed, erected or maintained shall be plainly marked at all times with the name of the person erecting or maintaining the billboard, and shall have the county permit number affixed to the billboard in such a manner that the information is legible from at least 50 feet away.

Sec. 62-40. - Variances.
The mere existence or destruction of a nonconforming billboard shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance for the building or rebuilding of a billboard. Upon written request, a variance from some or all of the requirements of this chapter may be granted at the discretion of the board of appeals and review, if the board finds all of the following conditions exist:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from the size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands in the area, or when the extraordinary circumstances result from a declared natural disaster, an act of God, or war.

Granting the variance will not confer upon the property or the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other properties or billboard owners.
