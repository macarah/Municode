Sec. 4.6. - MU Mixed-Use District

4.6.1. - Purpose and Administration
A.
Purpose
The purpose of the mixed-use district is to promote the redevelopment of existing single uses in commercial areas into vibrant and sustainable mixed-use communities combining residential, retail and office uses; to promote diversity in housing and commercial options; to create walkable, pedestrian-scaled environments that accommodate and encourage multiple modes of transportation; to provide opportunities to add a variety of open space amenities; to provide a framework for shared infrastructure; and to improve the quality of life by providing live, work, and play opportunities based on regulating master site plans developed for a specific area.
B.
Establishing a Mixed-Use District
1.
No MU mixed-use district shall be established without the concurrent approval of a Regulating Master Site Plan by the City Commission following public review and recommendation by city staff and the Planning Commission.
2.
The boundaries of each mixed-use district shall be as shown on the Zoning District Map and Comprehensive Land Use Plan and shall correspond with the adopted Regulating Master Site Plan.
3.
Once adopted, a Regulating Master Site Plan may be modified only after a hearing by the Planning Commission and approval of the City Commission; provided that modifications which do not change the mix or intensity of approved uses, the location or height of buildings, or other significant site features (including, but not limited to, location of streets, drives, parking structures, public spaces) may be approved administratively by the Zoning Administrator. Alterations to the streets and open spaces delineated on a Regulating Plan may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator, upon a finding by the Zoning Administrator that:
a.
Such streets and open spaces are not inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the governing zoning district and the regulating plan; and
b.
Such streets and open spaces provide equal or improved circulation and open space opportunities.
4.
This is the governing ordinance for all mixed-use districts, unless otherwise noted. Any subdivisions, lots consolidations, and replats in a mixed-use district shall conform to the adopted regulating plan for that area.
5.
The minimum size for a mixed-use district is 5 acres.
C.
Application
1.
For the purposes of this Section, where two or more properties, lots or parcels are located within the same block or where two or more properties, lots or parcels have frontage on the same side of the street and are adjoining and such properties, lots or parcels are under common ownership or control and/or are being developed in a single development operation or a series of coordinated development operations, such properties, lots or parcels shall be considered as a single property.
2.
Prior to the issuance of any building permit, the Zoning Administrator shall certify in writing that the proposed development for which such building permit is sought is consistent with all applicable requirements of the district, including the approved Regulating Master Site plan.
3.
Prior to the submittal of an application for a building permit, a pre-application conference between the applicant the Zoning Administrator is required to discuss the application and relevant requirements of these regulations.
4.
Following the pre-application conference, a total of 5 copies of each site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawing of each exterior building facade shall be submitted, as applicable, and reviewed for compliance by the Zoning Administrator.
5.
All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), expansions of outdoor dining or any construction which results in increased lot coverage or modification of the building footprint, shall be subject to said pre-application conference and submittal requirements. Routine repair and maintenance and interior improvements are not subject to the pre-application conference.
D.
Regulatory Plan
1.
Summary
A regulatory plan summarizes the maximum contemplated extent of development and gives a realistic indication of the mass, scale, and infrastructure for the district. It is the documented plan illustrating the location of required streets and open spaces to be provided to meet the minimum street and open space requirements The regulating plan must also identify the village subarea and transit station subarea as applicable. The regulatory plan is critical to ensuring that the intent and purpose of the district is implemented specifically as it relates to the provision of the street and open space network. Those streets and open spaces delineated on the regulatory plan shall not be interpreted as the only allowable streets and open spaces within the district as local streets, alleys and open spaces may also be provided in addition to those delineated on the plan.
2.
Documentation
All regulatory plans shall clearly delineate proposed streets and open spaces and corresponding dimensions and written descriptions for each element shall be provided. The regulatory plan shall be required for the pre-application conference and the official submittal of plans to the City. Documentation shall be provided as follows:
a.
Streets
Street documentation shall include the corresponding street classification of each street, the dimensions of the street right-of-way, lane widths, curb-to-curb widths, sidewalk clear zone widths, landscape zone widths and block dimensions.
b.
Open Spaces
Open space documentation shall include the total open space square footage calculation for each individual open space, the net square footage calculation of all open spaces and written description for each individual open space describing the type of each open space, the function of each open space and a general description of the predominant material or feature intended to be used for each open space (i.e. fountain, brick pavers, grass, shrubs, etc.).
c.
Front yards
The front yard for each development site shall be indicated on the regulating plan.
3.
Applicability
Streets and open spaces delineated in the regulatory plan may be permitted to be utilized for meeting the requirements of the governing zoning district. In no case shall the regulatory plan be utilized to permit the noncompliance with the regulations of this district, unless a special exception has been approved by the City Commission.
4.
Density Calculations
Parcels shall be permitted to calculate all future development calculations utilizing existing pre-construction property lines, provided that property owners seeking to calculate said density in this manner shall provide at the time of submission of the required application a sealed property line survey showing all pre-construction and post-construction property lines so as to enable the City to accurately verify said density calculations.
4.6.2. - Subareas Established
To guide the appropriate formation of mixed-use districts, two subareas are hereby established. The intent of each subarea is as follows:
A.
Village Subarea
Medium density residential and commercial uses intended to serve several adjacent neighborhoods.
B.
Transit Station Subarea
Higher density commercial and residential uses adjacent to major transportation corridors and transit nodes intended to serve larger areas of the city and surrounding communities, and provide larger commercial uses with a significant employment concentration.
C.
Use Limitations by Subarea
1.
Village Subarea

2.
Transit Station Subarea
Individual, stand-alone buildings containing a nonresidential use exceeding 20,000 square feet of floor area shall be separated from each other by a minimum distance of 600 feet as measured from the outside wall closest to the adjacent building. Individual, stand-alone buildings exceeding 20,000 square feet of floor area containing a nonresidential use that are attached to or include a residential use do not require separation from each other.
