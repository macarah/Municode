The land development administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The chairman shall then call for acknowledgment of a potential conflict of interest by members of the commission.

Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the county commission.

An action by the commission to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application and no further notice is required.
When, in the opinion of the county commission, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Greater Berrien Planning Advisory Commission at the time of their review of a land development matter, or should the commission desire to request further study by the planning commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the commission to table the issue and request that the planning commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the county commission prior to making a final decision.
