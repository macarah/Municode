Secs. 98-69—98-90. - Reserved.
DIVISION 3. - OPERATIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Sec. 98-91. - Separate water or sewer service.
Water and/or sewer service shall not be rendered separately unless the mayor and council finds that the denial of one service because of the inaccessibility of the other would create a health hazard or undue hardship, and by a majority vote in a regularly scheduled meeting allows the rendering of separate service. If such an exception is granted, all of the other provisions of this article shall still be in effect.
(Code 1976, § 5-1041; Ord. No. 88-51, 10-6-1988)
Sec. 98-92. - Service area.
(a)
It is the intent of the mayor and council to provide water service on a self-sustaining basis to any and/or all users within the corporate limits of the city. It is not the intent to add new water users outside of the corporate limits of the city. Service will be supplied to anyone requesting it, provided the service will be feasible financially, and insofar as possible self-sustaining. In cases where economic feasibility is a factor, the city shall have the final decision as to whether or not service will be provided. In determining feasibility, the city will consider the cost of construction as well as the cost of maintenance both before and after the extended system is fully utilized.
(b)
To compensate for the lower density in the outlying areas and the resulting greater unit costs of serving users in such areas, all water rates to users outside the corporate limits prior to October 6, 1988, shall be double those charged inside the city, including connection charges, regular water rates, cost recovery fees, and impact charges that may be assessed.
(c)
In order to accomplish the intent of this section, the city shall develop master plans for water mains and sewer outfalls, which shall be used as the guide for extensions to allow orderly growth of the system and development of the land within the city as well as in the areas surrounding the city as annexation occurs.
(Code 1976, § 5-1042)
Sec. 98-93. - Financing extensions generally.
It is the general philosophy of the city that water and sewer extensions will be made only when they are paid for totally or partially by the user, or where the extension proves financially attractive. Specifically, extensions will be made to various classes of users and facilities, as outlined in this section. All extensions shall be sized in accordance with the city's master water and sewer plans and/or as recommended by the city engineer and the water and sewer director. If the city's master plan or city officials require a water main or sewer outfall larger than is required to meet the needs of the proposed user, the proposed user may request participation by the city for payment of the difference in cost of the main needed by the user and the main required by the city to serve the area. The user's engineer shall calculate the needs of the user based on proposed land use. Water and sewer demand factors for the various land use categories shall be according to accepted engineering standards and peaking factors shall be according to Ten State Standards. Water demand shall include domestic use and total fire flows with a remaining residual of 20 psi. The user must provide at least an eight-inch main before the city will consider participation in oversizing costs. The city's participation in oversizing of water mains and sewer outfalls shall be limited to 2,000 feet in length. Participation shall be limited to available budgeted funds. The mayor and council shall have the final decision as to whether service will be granted and reserves the right to approval of any participation agreement.
(Code 1976, § 5-1043(a))
Sec. 98-94. - Service to existing individual residential and businesses.
Existing single residents and businesses in the city served by wells and septic tanks may request service from the city. The city shall have the service installed provided the user shall pay in advance the full cost of the main and the service to the property line. The city may consider participation in oversized mains as described in section 98-93.
(Code 1976, § 5-1043(b))
Sec. 98-95. - Service to groups of existing residences or businesses.
A group of existing residences or businesses in an area near major water transmission or wastewater interceptor lines may petition the city for service. As provided in the Charter, the mayor and council may cause the system to be installed and assess the total cost of all lines and services to the property benefited, whether the owner chooses to connect to the system or not.
(Code 1976, § 5-1043(c))
Sec. 98-96. - Service to undeveloped areas.
In order to promote growth and development in an area of the city, the mayor and council may cause the major water transmission lines, sewer outfalls, lift stations and treatment facilities to be installed and assess the total cost for materials and construction of the system to all properties benefited. The assessment shall be paid to the city prior to connection to the system and shall be in addition to the cost of any lines required to connect the individual users.
(Code 1976, § 5-1043(d))
Sec. 98-97. - Subdivisions.
All water and sewer lines within subdivisions shall be provided by the subdivision's developer as provided in the subdivision regulations, appendix B to this Code. All lines to connect to existing water transmission mains and sewer outfalls shall be provided by the subdivision's developer, except that the city may participate in required oversizing as provided in section 98-93. The definition of subdivision shall be the same as that in the city's subdivision regulations and shall include all classes of users, including residential, commercial and industrial classifications.
(Code 1976, § 5-1043(e))
Sec. 98-98. - Individual undeveloped lots.
Any person desiring service to an existing single undeveloped lot of record shall provide the required main extensions and individual service to connect to the main except that the city may participate in required oversizing as provided in section 98-93.
(Code 1976, § 5-1043(f))
Sec. 98-99. - Deposits.
(a)
A deposit as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk to secure payment of water and sewer bills shall be paid to the city at the time service is granted.
(b)
If the user of the city water and/or sewer system shall have made the deposit provided for in this section, the user will be entitled to a refund of the deposit, less the amount of water and/or sewer bills owing to the city, when such user shall move from the dwelling house.
(c)
The director of finance may waive the deposit requirements of residential, commercial and industrial property owners after an investigation is made and it is determined that the user is the property owner and has a prior record of prompt payment (no discontinuance of service for late payment) for a period of not less than two years on any other account established with the city water and sewer department.
(Code 1976, § 5-1044; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979; Ord. No. 80-38, 9-10-1980; Ord. No. 80-56, 12-10-1980)
Sec. 98-100. - Discontinuance of service.
If for any reason the water and sewer bill is not paid within 15 days of the deadline date specified on the bill, a second notice will be sent advising that service will be terminated if the bill is not paid within ten days. If the bill is still not paid within the ten-day period, the water service will be terminated without further notice. After service has been disconnected, the user will be required to pay a reconnection fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk, in addition to the current bill. No additional deposit will be required following a first discontinuation for nonpayment for any user.
(Code 1976, § 5-1045; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979)
Sec. 98-101. - Auxiliary residential water and/or sewer system.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city not to furnish water or sewer service where the user has in operation a well and/or private sewage disposal facility, except where such well or sewage facility exists on March 7, 1979. Where a user has a city water meter but is using domestic water from a private source, the user shall be notified of the requirement to cease the use of domestic water from the private source and use only city water, or the city water meter will be disconnected, and service will no longer be available for standby use. In case of disconnection of water service pursuant to this section, sewer service will also be terminated.
(b)
Each commercial or industrial sewer customer who uses a source of supply other than city water shall be required to install a meter on this private source of water, the meter to be accessible to city meter readers; and the sewer rate shall be based upon the meter readings made by the city.
(c)
No user shall have connections both to private well systems and to the city water system. This is not intended to prohibit the use of private wells for sprinkler systems, lawn watering, etc., provided the well is not connected in any manner to the same system as the city water system.
(Code 1976, § 5-1046; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979)
Sec. 98-102. - Ownership of system.
The city shall retain ownership of the water system up to and including the curb stop and water meter. The water meter shall be placed at the right-of-way, and no meter shall be located on private property except as authorized under section 98-106. The city's ownership of the sewer system shall extend to the user's property line (right-of-way). The city will repair and maintain only that portion of the system which it owns. Repairs or defects beyond the limits outlined in this section shall be at the sole expense of the user.
