In heavy industrial (HI) zoning districts, parking may be provided on gravel for heavy equipment (such as but not limited to dozers, loaders, compactors, cranes and the like in excess of 12,500 pounds) or semi-tractor trailers as long as there is a paved apron from the right-of-way 75 feet into the property that is at least 20 feet wide; said parking must be screened with a combination of landscaping and/or fencing subject to the approval of the community development department when visible from an adjacent property zoned in a more restrictive category or a local or minor roadway as defined on the city thoroughfare plan, as may be amended from time to time. If there is a building on a property zoned heavy industrial (HI), there shall be paved access to and around the building in accordance with all fire access requirements. Any required parking based on building size or use for vehicles under 12,500 pounds shall be paved and striped to city standards.

Sec. 909. - Accessory special event parking requirements.
The following section sets forth requirements for accessory special event parking:
(a)
Accessory special event parking shall only be permissible on property which has a non-residential zoning designation and has been registered with the city as a lot which will allow parking for special events. Registration shall be made by the owner of the lot on forms provided by and available at the community development department.
(b)
The accessory special event parking area must be paved, striped, and lit in compliance with standards prescribed in section 901 of the zoning ordinance. Vehicles must be parked on approved surfaces and in designated parking spaces.
(c)
Operation of an accessory special event parking area shall not adversely impact traffic management or public safety. All access driveways to the parking area shall remain unobstructed at all times. The stacking or queuing of cars on public streets or rights-of-ways shall be prohibited. The area designated for the collection of fees must prevent the obstruction of access drives and the queuing of cars onto public streets or right-of-ways.
(d)
The drive aisles within the special event parking area must remain open for vehicular circulation and public safety access. Stacking or double parking of cars shall be prohibited. There shall be an unobstructed exit available to every vehicle parked on the lot. No vehicle is to be blocked for any reason.
(e)
The accessory special event parking area must be staffed by at least two attendants who must be present at the parking area from the time the operator starts accepting payment on the lot for parking until the lot is full or the start of the special event, whichever occurs first. A minimum of one attendant must remain on the lot until one hour after the end of the special event. The attendants must be easily identifiable by uniform clothing indicating that they are employed to provide accessory special event parking.
(f)
On the day of a special event, a temporary A-frame sign must be displayed in the accessory special event parking area near each entrance to the parking area. The sign area must be minimum of six square feet with a maximum of 16 square feet. The maximum sign height shall be four feet, measured from grade to the top of the sign. The sign shall include a parking symbol and the following wording with the blanks filled in appropriately: "Special Event Parking Lot, Parking Fee $___, Operator phone #___-___-____." The parking fee must be in a font that is at least six inches in height. When the lot is full, the sign must be turned around to display wording visible from the street that the parking lot is full. The sign is a traffic management device, so no other wording is permitted on the sign. The sign must be of a durable material, such as plastic, metal, wood, or like material, and must be professionally fabricated and maintained in good repair. A sign permit is not required for this sign, which may be displayed four hours prior to the event and removed two hours after completion of the special event. The parking symbol, the wording, and the fee must be visible from the adjacent street. The parking fee must remain the same throughout the day of the special event unless decreased, and the amount charged for parking must not exceed the amount stated on the sign. The sign must be visible on the special event parking area from the time cars are admitted for the special event parking until the property has been cleaned of litter at the end of the special event.
(g)
Adequate waste and recycling receptacles shall be provided on-site during operations. The property shall be clean and litter-free immediately after operations. Generated waste shall be collected and disposed of, consistent with applicable state and local ordinances.
