Footnotes:
--- (10) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 16-11 , Pt. I, adopted Sept. 27, 2016, repealed former Art. VII in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former Art. VII, §§ 2-200—2-212, pertained to the local business enterprise program, and derived from Ord. No. 06-25, Pt. I, adopted Nov. 28, 2006.

Sec. 2-200. - Short title and purpose.
(a)
Short title. This article shall be known as the "DeKalb First ordinance" or the "LSBE ordinance" and may be cited as such.
(b)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to create the DeKalb First which requires vendors interested in doing business with the county to employ or make good faith efforts to employ local businesses to fulfill a portion of the work. The Constitution of Georgia empowers DeKalb County with the legislative power to adopt reasonable ordinances and/or resolutions relating to its property, affairs, and local government for which no provision has been made by general law and which are not inconsistent with the Constitution of Georgia. The county spends significant revenue on purchasing supplies, materials, and equipment, and retaining contractual and professional services. The dollars used in making these purchases are derived in some measure from taxes and fees paid by local businesses; thus, funds generated in the community should, to the extent possible, be used to "DeKalb First" thereby allowing the funds to be re-invested in the local county economy. There is an inherent benefit in procuring services or goods from local small businesses who contribute to the county's economy and tax base and thus there is a substantial reason to offer a portion of publicly funded contracting opportunities to those qualified local small businesses. "DeKalb First" means that whenever possible, appropriate and authorized by applicable law, the county intends to buy its materials, and procure services from certified, qualified local small businesses in DeKalb County and the metropolitan Atlanta area. To encourage larger contractors, vendors and professional firms to partner with such local small businesses, the county enacts this article giving certain incentives to larger businesses if they use qualified, certified local small businesses or at least make a good faith effort to secure subcontracts with such local small businesses when performing services for or selling goods to the county. "DeKalb First" is an initiative that protects and enhances the economic development of the county and improves the financial well- being of its citizenry because the program creates local jobs and improves the county's economic base by helping DeKalb businesses grow. As DeKalb County businesses grow and expand tax revenue and fees paid by such businesses increases and opportunities for taxpayers to work in the county where they live increases. Enactment of this ordinance encourages local small businesses to remain in DeKalb County and grow and prosper thereby directly and indirectly increasing the financial stability of DeKalb County government.

Sec. 2-204. - Benchmarks and incentives.
(a)
To qualify for incentives under the DeKalb First ordinance, a prime contractor shall be a certified LSBE or submit written documentation showing that at least twenty (20) percent of the total contract award will be performed by a LSBE(s) unless the prime contractor can demonstrate sufficient good faith efforts as set forth in this article.
(b)
The LSBE review panel, stating the reason in writing, may waive, decrease, or increase this twenty-percent benchmark for any particular contract prior to release of the qualified sealed solicitation or as an addendum to such solicitation. The department shall grant lower incentives if the LSBE review panel lowers the LSBE benchmark for participation as outlined in this section. The percentage by which the benchmark is lowered shall be used to calculate the lower amount of incentive.
(c)
The incentives are:
Requests for proposals.
(1)
Ten (10) points in the initial evaluation of a response to a request for proposal for meeting the LSBE benchmark with a prime contractor who is a local LSBE or is a prime contractor using local LSBE(s);
(2)
Five (5) points in the initial evaluation of responses to any request for proposal for meeting the applicable LSBE benchmark with a prime contractor that is an MSA LSBE or a prime contractor utilizes MSA LSBE(s); and
(3)
Prime contractors who demonstrate sufficient good faith efforts in accordance with the requirements of this article shall be granted two (2) points in the initial evaluation of responses to a request for proposal.
Invitations to bid.
(4)
If a prime contractor who is deemed responsible and remains responsive to an invitation to bid because it is or has obtained twenty (20) percent participation of an LSBE DeKalb or LSBE MSA firm, submits the lowest bid price in response to a qualified sealed solicitation, that prime contractor shall be deemed the lowest responsible and responsive bidder and submitted to the chief executive officer or the governing authority, whichever is appropriate under law, for award of the contract;
(5)
In addition to meeting all other requirements for responsiveness, prime contractors who demonstrate sufficient good faith efforts in accordance with the requirements of this article shall be deemed responsive in the initial evaluation of responses to an invitation to bid.
(6)
If a prime contractor who is deemed responsible and remains responsive to an invitation to bid because of its good faith efforts, submits a lower bid price than a prime contractor who actually achieves the twenty-percent or otherwise required benchmark, then the prime contractor who actually met the benchmark will be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid price of the prime contractor who only made good faith efforts. If that prime contractor chooses NOT to match that bid price, the prime contractor who made the good faith effort will be deemed the lowest responsible responsive bidder and submitted to the chief executive officer or the governing authority, whichever is appropriate under law, for award of the contract.
(d)
Where a mixture of LSBE DeKalb and LSBE MSA firms are utilized, pro-rated points shall be granted by the department based upon the utilization for each based upon the terms of the qualified sealed solicitation.
(e)
If the prime contractor fails to meet the required benchmark for LSBE participation or fails to make sufficient good faith efforts as set forth in section 2-206 in response to an invitation to bid or a request for proposal, then the prime contractor's bid or proposal shall be deemed nonresponsive. If the bid or proposal is deemed nonresponsive, the cost proposal shall not be considered.
( Ord. No. 16-11 , Pt. I, 9-27-16)
Sec. 2-205. - Calculation of LSBE participation.
(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a subcontract that is performed by the LSBE shall be counted as its participation, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the LSBE for the work for the subcontract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the LSBE. Supplies and equipment the LSBE purchases or leases from the prime contractor or its affiliate shall not count as LSBE participation.
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a LSBE for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract shall be counted as LSBE participation.
(c)
If an LSBE has a decertifying event during the term of a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that business after it is decertified shall not be counted toward the prime contractor's LSBE participation goal. No contractor shall be penalized as a result of the failure of a project to achieve the benchmarks set forth in its contract if the LSBE fails to meet the conditions of section 2-207.
(d)
In determining the achievement of a benchmark, the participation of a LSBE shall not be counted until the dollar amount being counted has been received by that LSBE.
(e)
Achievement of benchmarks authorized by this article shall be evaluated after the project is twenty-five (25) percent, fifty (50) percent, and then seventy-five (75) percent complete. Meeting or failing to meet contractual benchmarks may be used for evaluative and/or award purposes in considering the prime contractor and/or LSBE in future qualified sealed solicitations.
( Ord. No. 16-11 , Pt. I, 9-27-16)
Sec. 2-206. - Good faith efforts in lieu of meeting benchmarks.
(a)
A prime contractor must meet the required LSBE benchmark of twenty (20) percent (unless otherwise modified in the qualified sealed solicitation), unless it can demonstrate that good faith efforts yielded no qualified LSBEs and document those good faith efforts in writing.
(b)
Prime contractors are expected to make sufficient good faith efforts at the outset of preparing a response to a qualified sealed solicitation, so that LSBEs have an adequate opportunity to partner with prime contractors in response to a solicitation. Failure of any prime contractor to attend the mandatory LSBE meeting required in this article, in person or via video conference, shall mean that the prime contractor has not demonstrated sufficient good faith efforts and its bid or proposal, if submitted, shall be deemed non- responsive without any further review by the department.
(c)
Factors for determining if sufficient good faith efforts were made, shall include but are not limited to the compilation of a contact log including the date of contact, name, address and contact number or email address used to contact the proposed LSBE subcontractors, the name and title of the person making the effort for the prime contractor; the nature of work requested and full detailed description of the scope of work for which a quote was requested; the amount of the quoted price, if one (1) was obtained; and any additional LSBE subcontractor information as requested on forms promulgated by the department. The director also maintains the right to interview any proposed LSBE subcontractor included on the contact log to verify the effort made.
(d)
During the evaluation of the bid or proposal, the director shall determine if sufficient good faith efforts were made by the prime contractor. If the determination is made that a prime contractor did not make sufficient good faith efforts, the bid/proposal will be deemed non- responsive and shall not receive any further review by the department.
(e)
The department of purchasing and contracting shall maintain documentation of all good faith efforts performed by a prime contractor, and a copy of these records shall be kept with the official bid/contract file, in compliance with all record retention laws or two (2) years, whichever is longer.
(f)
If all prime contractors for a particular qualified sealed solicitation fail to meet the required benchmark for LSBE participation and fail in making good faith efforts, as defined by this article, the LSBE benchmark requirement may be waived by the chief executive officer or designee.
( Ord. No. 16-11 , Pt. I, 9-27-16)
Sec. 2-207. - Prime contractor responsibility.
(a)
Any business concern may submit a response to a qualified sealed solicitation regardless of their certification status under section 2-203.
(b)
When subcontracting, every prime contractor must independently evaluate each LSBE and confirm qualifications, and previous practical, demonstrable experience in the area in which the LSBE intends to perform services and references prior to including the LSBE in a qualified sealed solicitation. Information obtained by the county in this regard may be provided to the prime contractor by the director upon request, but each prime contractor understands that it must investigate, and independently verify an LSBE's qualifications and ability to perform the service or work at issue.
(c)
In each qualified sealed solicitation, all prime contractors shall identify a portion of the work available to LSBEs consistent with their previous demonstrable expertise, and shall submit a proposed work schedule that identifies the work to be completed by the LSBE(s) with their bid/proposal, if any. This proposed work schedule shall be finalized and submitted to the county within ten (10) days of the notice to proceed meeting. This work schedule shall become the basis for determining compliance with the terms of this article after execution of the contract.
(d)
The prime contractor shall attend the LSBE meeting in person or via video conference and shall provide interested LSBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and other such requirements of the qualified sealed solicitation to facilitate their bid or proposal submission and document all communications, in accordance with the requirements of this article.
(e)
The prime contractor shall submit a notarized schedule of LSBE participation detailing all LSBE businesses from which the prime contractor solicited bids. This schedule shall be submitted at the qualified sealed solicitation due date and time in order to be granted any preferential points.
(f)
Each prime contractor shall be required to sign an affidavit declaring under penalty of perjury its intention to comply fully with the provisions of this article, and attesting to the truth and accuracy of all information provided to the county. All prime contractors and LSBEs must adhere to all federal, state, and local law, and applicable provisions of this Code. All such affidavits shall also contain a provision whereby the prime contractor declares under penalty of perjury that no subcontract(s), LSBE or otherwise, shall contain language requiring mandatory, binding arbitration or in any other way limit subcontractor(s) from addressing disputes with the prime contractor(s) through any and all legal means.

(a)
At or around the time of award, but no later than the kickoff meeting, the director shall verify that a subcontract for the agreed upon percentage or dollar amount of the total contract price adopted and approved by the governing authority, has been executed by the prime contractor and the LSBE(s), and the prime contractor shall provide each LSBE's subcontract and an email address for the LSBE for notification purposes, to the director. The director shall also verify that all subcontract(s), including LSBE subcontracts, do not require mandatory, binding arbitration or in any other way limit the subcontractor(s) from addressing disputes with the prime contractor(s) through any and all legal means. Failure to provide the requisite subcontract(s) shall be grounds for rejection of a qualified sealed solicitation and/or termination of the prime contract.
(b)
The prime contractor cannot make changes to the notarized schedule of LSBE participation or substitute subcontractors named in the notarized schedule of LSBE participation without the prior written consent of the LSBE review panel. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this section, and may constitute grounds for rejection of a qualified sealed solicitation or cause termination of the contract for breach. In such instances, DeKalb County may withhold payment and/or impose other sanctions. Written consent for changes shall not be unreasonably withheld from the prime contractor.
(c)
All requests for changes or substitutions of the subcontractors named in the notarized schedule of LSBE participation shall be made in writing to the LSBE review panel and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request, including documentary proof or affidavits of individuals, where necessary. The LSBE review panel will review the request and make a final decision. The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been known by either party prior to the submission of the notarized schedule of LSBE participation. Post-award LSBE shopping is prohibited and may be cause for cancellation, rejection or other punitive remedies against the prime contractor.
(d)
Performance issues between the prime contractor and LSBE are governed by the subcontract between the prime contractor and the LSBE, and should be resolved by the LSBE and the prime contractor. If a prime contractor alleges poor performance by an LSBE and desires a substitution for that reason, the prime contractor shall submit a detailed written report with supporting documentation to the director. The director will meet with representatives from the prime contractor, the LSBE, and the county's user department with the goal of moving the project forward. If there is no meaningful resolution, the prime contractor may then submit a request to substitute LSBE(s) to the LSBE review panel.
(e)
If a prime contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the notarized schedule of LSBE participation the prime contractor shall inform the existing LSBE(s) of the new scope of work and if the LSBE(s) accepts the offer of work, the percent of work shall flow to the LSBE subcontractor in the same manner as outlined in the original contract. If the existing LSBE subcontractor declines the work, the prime contractor shall obtain the approval of the LSBE review panel to modify the notarized schedule of LSBE participation and must make good faith efforts to ensure that LSBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(f)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be recorded and reported by the DeKalb County department responsible for overseeing the work to be performed at the time they arise, to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the benchmarks identified in this article.
(g)
In the event a "stop work" order is issued to the prime contractor, the director shall notify the LSBE(s) and provide the LSBE(s) with a copy of the stop work order via the email address provided in the LSBE subcontract.
(h)
In the event of non-payment by a prime contractor to any LSBE, the LSBE has the right to request a meeting with the director. This meeting will include representatives from the prime contractor, the LSBE, the county's user department and the director with the goal of payment for performance. A finding of repeated non-payment by any prime contractor without reasonable cause may be cause for contract cancellation for breach, and other administrative remedies as allowed under applicable county policy.
(i)
Each prime contractor shall deliver a monthly report form to the director and to the LSBE, listing all work completed by the LSBE and payments made. The report shall be supported by copies of checks, invoices and any other documents to substantiate that work and payments to the subcontractor have been made. Failure to submit a report may result in declaring a contract in default and subsequent termination of the contract.

(a)
Upon award of a contract by DeKalb County that includes the applicable LSBE benchmarks identified in this article, the prompt pay obligations in DeKalb County's contract with the prime contractor, and the contract between the prime contractor and the subcontractors, become covenants of performance by the contractor in favor of DeKalb County.

The director may request the business concern to produce documents relevant to the denial or decertification event. The business concern's failure to comply within ten (10) days of these requests may be grounds for denial of the protest at the discretion of the executive assistant.

The executive assistant shall make the final determination based on the information presented at the protest meeting and supplemental information provided, if any, within ten (10) days of the protest meeting.
