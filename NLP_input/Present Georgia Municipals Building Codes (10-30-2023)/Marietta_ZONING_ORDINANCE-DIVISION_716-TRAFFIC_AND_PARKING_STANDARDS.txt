DIVISION 716 - TRAFFIC AND PARKING STANDARDS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 6888, adopted Dec. 14, 2005, amended Div. 716 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Div. 716 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from the 1996 Code of Ordinances, §§ 7-8-2-14-190—7-8-2-14-220; and the 1998 Zoning Ordinance.

716.01 - Purpose.
These standards are intended to provide the reasonable provision of future off-street parking within the City of Marietta; to restrict temporary storage of vehicles and recreational vehicles in residential districts; to alleviate any unnecessary traffic congestion which could result from on-street parking; and to encourage development and usage of off-street parking facilities.
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1)
716.02 - Street access and curb cuts.
A.
Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel which abuts a public street for at least 30 feet, or has the minimum lot frontage established by zoning, or has access to a public street by means of a recorded access easement if approved by the Development Services Director and Public Works Director.
B.
Street access and curb cuts for service drives, entrances, exits and other similar facilities on public streets in other than residential districts shall be approved by the Public Works Director. Curb cuts constructed for new driveways to developments on arterial and collector streets shall be aligned directly across from existing curb cuts. The Public Works Director may approve other locations when it is determined that alignment with an existing curb cut is not appropriate. No curb cuts shall be located within 40 feet of any intersection or within 30 feet of another curb cut measured along the curb line. A curb cut shall be no greater than 30 feet in width, and no closer than 20 feet to any property line unless approved by the Public Works Director.
C.
All entrances or exits of any street or drive, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state highway department prior to the construction of such street or drive, or the issuance of any development permit for any improvement to be served by such street or drive.
D.
No curb cuts for commercial developments may be placed along residential streets.
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1)
716.03 - Street improvements.
A.
The Public Works Director may require improvements such as the widening of streets and/or rights-of-way or the addition of curbs and gutters, in order to accommodate the increased traffic due to proposed developments.
B.
Existing streets shall be connected and extended throughout the limits of proposed developments. If such street is already used primarily for residential access, requested street improvements to provide access to a proposed nonresidential use must be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals before being connected, extended or in any way provided access to the nonresidential use.
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1)
716.04 - Corner visibility clearance.
In all districts except CBD, no fence, structure, sign, planting or other obstruction (above a height of 3 feet) shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way unless approved by the Public Works Director.
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1)
716.05 - Private streets.
Private streets within any district shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this article. Private streets within any district shall be assigned names and locations and names of such streets shall be shown on plans required for the issuance of building and development permits. All private street names shall be approved by the Development Services Director to avoid conflicting street names. Section 726.04 further controls private streets and their standards.
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1)
716.06 - Private alleys.
The use of alleys may be deemed appropriate in specifically designated redevelopment areas according to the regulations set forth in this section. Private alleys should only be included within developments as a secondary means of access to the rear or sides of buildings, and should not be substituted as a primary street. The developer is required to install "No Parking" signs on all alleyways. All developments for which alleys are proposed shall be reviewed and approved by City Council at a regularly scheduled meeting as a separate item on the agenda.
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1; Ord. No. 6917, 5/10/2006, § 1)
716.07 - Parking spaces required.
The required number of parking spaces shall be provided on the same lot with the use it serves, except:
A.
If vehicular parking or storage space required cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 400 feet of the main entrance of such principal use and meets the storage requirements set forth in Section 710.07. Such vehicular parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner.
B.
The required parking spaces of any number of separated uses may be combined in 1 lot, but the required spaces assigned to 1 use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sunday may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sunday.
C.
No street parking spaces may be allowed as meeting the parking requirement except in the CBD district. There shall be no required parking spaces in the CBD district except as provided in Subsection 708.18 G.
D.
No parking area may be used for the sale, repair, dismantling, servicing or long term storage of any vehicle or equipment.
E.
Required spaces. Table J enumerates the minimum off-street parking provision standards for all properties within the city. If a building or development contains multiple uses, the number of spaces required shall be calculated by summing the amount required by each individual use. Parking areas are encouraged to be set to the side or rear of the primary building in such a manner as to reduce visibility from the street (see individual zoning districts for density bonuses relating to parking location and/or structures).
F.
If required parking is provided exclusively in the rear yard, then the required front yard setback may be reduced 50%.
G.
Where parking spaces are provided in on-site underground or deck parking, a bonus floor area of 350 square feet for each provided parking space shall be allowed.
H.
Any entity that retrofits an existing site without vehicular or pedestrian interconnection to provide permanent access to adjacent sites' parking and sidewalks, provided said access is to separate developments owned by separate entities, shall be allowed a 10% reduction in required parking.
I.
All developments wherein the front door is located within 250 feet of a public transit stop shall be allowed a 10% reduction in required parking.

The parking of any vehicle (including, but not limited to trailers and boats) on any lot in any district on other than a surface treated and hardened to accommodate vehicles up to 8,000 pounds GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) is prohibited.
B.
Minimum standards for surfaces treated and hardened to accommodate vehicles up to 8,000 pounds are as follows:
1.
Concrete. Four inches of 2,500 psi concrete with control joints at least every 30 feet, or if no control joints are utilized, then wire reinforcement throughout.
2.
Asphalt. Binder and topping course mixes at least 3 inches thick.

Brick. Bricks laid in a 2-inch concrete base.
C.
A parking plan for all uses shall be submitted with the building plans. The Development Services Director and Public Works Director shall review the proposed parking plan to insure its conformance with all applicable provisions of this article. Occupancy or use of a building shall not be allowed until the parking facilities are completed in accordance with the approved plan. The provisions of the required spaces on a temporary basis on a hard surfaced sub-base (subgrade plus an asphalt first layer or bound crushed stone aggregate) shall satisfy this requirement. All parking facilities including entrances, exits and maneuvering areas shall comply with the following:
1.
Design of parking areas, including space and driveway arrangement, shall conform to the geometric design standards of the Institute of Traffic Engineers, which is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. The City Clerk shall maintain a copy of said standards of the Institute of Traffic Engineers on file for inspection by the public.
2.
Have access to a public street and be graded and paved. Curbing may be required when needed for effective drainage control to prevent damage to abutting property or public streets, subject to approval by the Public Works Director.
3.
Have all spaces marked with paint lines, curb stones or other similar designations (single-family residential uses are exempt if fewer than 3 spaces are provided).
4.
Provide individual parking spaces with dimensions not less than 9 feet wide and 20 feet deep, exclusive of passageways. In the cases of 25 or more required parking spaces 25% of the required spaces may be of an area not less than 8 feet by 16 feet.
5.
Provide interior drives with a minimum width of 20 feet which connect each space with a public street.
6.
Parking areas established within a residential district for a permitted nonresidential use shall provide visual screening between vehicle use areas, including all accessways, and the abutting residential property. Such screening may consist of a wall or solid fence no less than 5 feet in height and/or a vegetative row of hedges and trees sufficient in nature to provide continuous visual screening. Such screening improvements shall be located upon a nonpaved surface at least 5 feet in width and are subject to approval by the Director of the Development Services Department. See standards set forth in Section 712.08 (Tree Protection and Landscaping) for landscaping requirements.
7.
Adequate lighting shall be provided if the facilities are to be used at night. Such lighting shall be arranged and installed so as not to reflect or cause glare on abutting properties.
8.
No parking or loading area shall be established in the required front yard of any residential district except for a single-family residential use; no more than 35% of the required front yard may be paved or used for parking in such case.
9.
The parking areas shall be permanently maintained by the owners or the occupants for their invites or licensees so long as the use(s) exists.

C.
Vehicle repair may not be conducted on vehicles located on any public street. This prohibition shall not apply to emergency repairs taking less than 24 hours to complete.

A loading/unloading berth shall have a minimum dimension of 12 feet by 35 feet by 14 feet overhead clearance. Such facilities must be designed so that no truck/vehicle maneuvering occurs on the public right-of-way, nor in areas designated for the parking of vehicles, except in the Central Business District in which case designated loading/unloading zones may also be utilized. Further, except in designated loading/unloading zones in the Central Business District, no truck/vehicle shall utilize any part of the public right-of-way to load/unload any product, equipment, or goods.
