Infrastructure maintenance fee. The streets, rights-of-way, and public easements to be used by the company in the operation of its business within the boundaries of the city as such boundaries now exist and exist from time to time during the term of this contract, are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and the city will incur costs to regulate and administer this article. In consideration of such benefits, costs and expenses, the company shall through the term of its operations collect an "infrastructure maintenance fee" equal to five percent of the company's gross receipts to customers within the city (exclusive of sales tax). The term "infrastructure maintenance fee" shall be used on all bills, invoices, or statements sent by any company to a customer under this article. This fee is applicable to haulers that are providing trash and recycling collection to residential accounts as well as haulers serving commercial accounts.
(1)
Fees paid. The infrastructure maintenance fee shall be payable quarterly to the city and delivered to the city in conjunction with a statement indicating the derivation and calculation of such payment. Each such quarterly payment shall be due on the 15th day of the second month following the end of the quarterly period for which said payment is due. The quarterly payments shall be due on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15 of each year during the term hereof, with the February 15 payment being based upon the company's gross receipts during the calendar quarter ending the prior December 31 and being payment for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for said calendar quarter, the May 15 payment being based upon the company's gross receipts during the calendar quarter ending the prior March 31 and being payment for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for said calendar quarter, the August 15 payment being based upon the company's gross receipts during the calendar quarter ending the prior June 30 and being payment for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for said calendar quarter, and the November 15 payment being based upon the company's gross receipts during the calendar quarter ending the prior September 30 and being payment for the rights and privileges granted hereunder for said calendar quarter. During the implementation of this article, all bills generated by companies after December 1, 2006, shall include the infrastructure maintenance fee. The city shall provide material relating to the education and marketing efforts of the infrastructure maintenance fee as well as provide education and training to company employees to ensure a consistent message is conveyed to constituents of the city. For purposes of verifying the amount of such fee, the books of the company shall at all reasonable times be subject to inspection by the duly authorized representatives of the city. If the infrastructure maintenance fee is not paid by the due date as set forth herein, the company from whom the fee was due shall be assessed and shall pay a late fee in the amount of ten percent of the amount not timely paid. In addition, all amounts otherwise due, including late fees, shall accrue interest at the rate of 1.5 percent per calendar month beginning 30 days after the original due date.
(2)
No other rental fees. The infrastructure maintenance fee shall be in lieu of any and all other city-imposed rentals or compensation or contract, privilege, instrument, occupation, excise, ordinance, revenue, or other taxes, fees, or charges (except ad valorem property taxes, special assessments for local improvements, city sales tax, and such other charges for utility services imposed uniformly upon persons, firms, or corporations then engaged in business within the city) or any permits upon or relating to the business, revenue, installations and systems, fixtures, and any other facilities of the company and all other property of the company and its activities, or any part thereof, in the city which relate to the operations of the company pursuant to this article; provided, that this shall not be construed to prevent the company from being required to pay any and all applicable fees and charges in effect from time to time for dumping at a landfill or transfer station.
(3)
Credit for fees paid. Should the city not have the legal power to agree that the payment of the foregoing sums of money shall be in lieu of city-imposed rentals; compensation; or contract, privilege, instrument, occupation, excise, ordinance, revenue, or other taxes, fees, or charges, then city agrees that it will apply so much of said sums of money paid as may be necessary to company's obligations, if any, to pay any such city-imposed rentals; compensation; or contract, privilege, instrument, occupation, excise, ordinance, revenue, or other taxes, fees, or charges.
(4)
Reporting. Any company providing service pursuant to this article or a resulting contract shall from time to time provide the city with the necessary statistics regarding waste collected and disposed which shall allow the city to comply with state reporting requirements. Such information shall be in the manner and format requested by the city and provide adequate details for the city to maintain compliance with local, state, federal, and all other guidelines relating to solid waste collection, removal, and disposal.
(5)
Dedicated revenue. The infrastructure maintenance fee collected by the city under this article shall be dedicated to the following: (i) maintenance of the city's streets, corridors, alleys, thoroughfares, and transportation routes; (ii) administration of contract compliance between customers and companies where service is received as provided in this article; and (iii) collection of litter, trash and hazardous waste materials within the city.

Promptly after receipt from any third party by city of a written notice of any demand, claim, or circumstance that, immediately or with the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding, or investigation (an "asserted claim") that may result in losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the city shall give written notice thereof (the "claims notice") to the company provided, however, that a failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the city's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the company is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The claims notice shall describe the asserted claim in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the losses that have been or may be suffered by the city when such information is available. The company may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any asserted claim. If the company elects to compromise or defend such asserted claim, it shall, within 20 business days following its receipt of the claims notice (or sooner, if the nature of the asserted claim so requires) notify the city of its intent to do so, and the city shall cooperate, at the expense of the company, in the compromise of, or defense against, such asserted claim. If the company elects not to compromise or defend the asserted claim, fails to notify the city of its election as herein provided, or contests its obligation to provide indemnification under this agreement, the city may pay, compromise, or defend such asserted claim with all reasonable costs and expenses borne by the company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the company nor the city may settle or compromise any claim without the consent of the other party; provided, however, that such consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any event, the city and the company may participate at their own expense, in the defense of such asserted claim. If the company chooses to defend any asserted claim, the city shall make available to the company any books, records, or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.
