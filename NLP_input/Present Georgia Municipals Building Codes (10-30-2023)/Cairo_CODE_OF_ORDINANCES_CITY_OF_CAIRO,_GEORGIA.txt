PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume.
The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fifth section of chapter 9 is 9-5. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-4 and 2-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 2-4.1, 2-4.2 and 2-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 6 and 7 it will be designated as chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Index
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof.
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

All provisions of the Code shall be in full force and effect from and after January 1, 1985, and all conflicting provisions of ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on final passage on or before July 17, 1984, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of the Code.
Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this ordinance.
Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, a violation of any provision or such Code, or any provision of any rule or regulation adopted or issued pursuant thereto, shall be punished by a fine of not more than six hundred dollars ($600.00), and imprisonment of not more than sixty (60) days, or both, as provided in section 1-8 of such Code.
Section 5. Any and all additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the governing body to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code shall be understood and intended to include the additions and amendments.
Section 6. In case of the amendment of any section of the Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in section 4 of this ordinance and in section 1-8 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended, or in case the amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in the other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless the penalty is specifically repealed therein.
Section 7. Any ordinance adopted after July 17, 1984, which amends or refers to ordinances which have been codified in the Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code.

The city clerk, from time to time, upon instructions from the mayor and council, shall insert in their designated places all amendments or ordinances which indicate the intention of the mayor and council to make the same a part of such Code when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from such Code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed by the mayor and council. This copy of such Code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine the same.
Section 9. It shall be unlawful for any person to change, or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the City of Cairo to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 4 of this ordinance.
