(1)

(2)
Assigning qualification standards for recruiting;
(3)
Analyzing work distribution, areas of responsibility, lines of authority and other relationships between positions;
(4)
Determining salaries and budget requirements;
(5)
Developing standards of work performance;
(6)
Establishing lines of promotion;
(7)
Determining training needs;
(8)
Providing uniform job terminology to convey the same meaning to all concerned.
