DIVISION 250. - MHS MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION DISTRICT

Sec. 250-010. - Purpose and intent.
The MHS Manufactured Home Subdivision District is composed of medium to high density single-family manufactured home developments of ten acres or more. The primary intent of this district is to provide areas in which property owners may place manufactured homes on individual lots within subdivisions. Such development should be located along existing public facilities, but provisions are made for areas which require individual wells and/or septic tanks. As in all districts, this type of development should be located around or near similar development, and should not substantially alter area land use. Should an existing lot of record, not intended for a minor or major subdivision, zoned under this district become obsolete because of surrounding development trends, development of site-built homes may be allowed.

Principal uses and structures shall be allowed in the MHS Manufactured Home Subdivision District in accordance with division 505 of this ordinance.
