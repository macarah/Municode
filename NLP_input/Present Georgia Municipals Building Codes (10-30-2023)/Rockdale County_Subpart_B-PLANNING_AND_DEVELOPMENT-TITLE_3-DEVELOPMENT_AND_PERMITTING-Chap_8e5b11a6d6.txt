(c)
Better site design practices for stormwater management: Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM 2.3.
(d)
Stormwater runoff reduction/water quality: Stormwater runoff reduction/water quality shall be provided by using the following:
(i)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before December 1, 2020, the applicant may choose either: (A) runoff reduction or (B) water quality.
(ii)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after December 1, 2020, the applicant shall choose: (A) runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent (A) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy; then (B) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
(A)
Runoff reduction - The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
(B)
Water quality - The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event.

(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
Secs. 310-111—310-130. - Reserved.
ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 310-131. - Findings.
The county board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact:
(1)
Rockdale County is authorized by the State Constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services throughout Rockdale County.
(2)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of Rockdale County hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(3)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this Section, Rockdale County is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Charter of Rockdale County to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ III(a)(6).
(4)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to Rockdale County.
(5)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within Rockdale County and surrounding areas.
(6)
The county presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the county, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the county to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the county in concert with the management of other water resources within the county. In order to do so, the county must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage related capital improvement needs.
(7)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the operations of sanitary sewer operated by Rockdale County by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(8)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on the county's wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies.
(9)
Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing and future development in Rockdale County. Rockdale County has several rivers and streams listed on the list of impaired waters produced by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, or other appropriate authorities pursuant to Section 303(d) of the Act.
(10)
The county is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the county's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Georgia Notice of Intent (NOI) and stormwater permit effective March 13, 2003] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the county to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(11)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES permit will substantially increase the cost of stormwater management above that which is currently spent for water quality management, drainage and flood control.
(12)
The cost of operating and maintaining the county stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(13)
The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the stormwater utility implementation master plan, prepared by the county's consulting stormwater engineer, properly assesses and defines the county's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy.
(14)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the county in concert with other water resource management programs.
(15)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the unincorporated areas of the county. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the unincorporated areas of the county is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(16)
The stormwater needs in the county include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the county in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation master plan.
(17)
The services and benefits rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management services, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the county's stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(18)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the county, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services in the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated portions of the county through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility implementation master plan prepared for the county.
(19)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated area of the county. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners.
(20)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the county stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property benefited by such systems.
(21)
The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the county or to be provided by the county in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge.
(22)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the county stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

Editor's note— The "Stormwater Utility Construction Expenditure Rating System" (as shown in section 2 of Ord. No. 0-2011-11, adopted July 12, 2011), referenced as if fully set out herein, is on file and available for inspection in the office of the county clerk and/or the stormwater manager.
Sec. 310-135. - Stormwater service area.
The stormwater service area shall consist of all properties in unincorporated Rockdale County and may be amended from time to time. A current map of the stormwater service area shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater director for public inspection.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 0-2018-15, § 3, 11-13-2018)
Sec. 310-136. - User fee charges.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the county that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees or licenses. User fee charge rates shall be structured to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the unincorporated areas of the county, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments. In setting the rentals, rates, charges, fees or licenses for stormwater manage-ment services, the board of commissioners shall also take into consideration the impact such will have in regulating the use of such services.
(b)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the county's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
Sec. 310-137. - Stormwater user fee charge rates.
(a)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the board of commissioners. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the board of commissioners to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, reflect the value of the stormwater management services to those property owners who benefit therefrom, and which, together with other sources of support available to the county stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners.
(b)
A stormwater user fee charge shall be billed to all developed properties within the county's stormwater service area. This fee may be adjusted by resolution from time to time by the board of commissioners.
(c)
A stormwater user fee charge shall be billed to all county-owned rights-of-way. This fee may be adjusted by resolution from time to time by the board of commissioners.

Sec. 310-138. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions.
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the county's stormwater service area shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the amount of impervious area or to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Parcels which contain no more than 200 square feet of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(2)
Railroad tracks and other infrastructure within railroad rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(3)
Roads and other infrastructure within Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT within their rights-of-way. However, maintenance buildings and/or other developed land used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 0-2018-15, § 5, 11-13-2018)

(1)
A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the Credit Technical Manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the Credit Technical Manual.
(2)
Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the county's design and performance standards as stated in the Credit Technical Manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The stormwater manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the Credit Technical Manual or this article.
(3)
In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the county on forms provided by the stormwater manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Credit Technical Manual.
(4)
Property owners may apply for any credits or adjustments that they believe apply.
(5)
The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format established by the stormwater manager. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing.
(b)
When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater manager, he shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is accepted to either grant the credit in whole, grant the credit in part, or deny the credit. Credits applied for by the property owner and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the Credit Technical Manual.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
Sec. 310-140. - Enforcement methods and inspections.
(a)
All property owners of developed lands within the unincorporated areas of Rockdale County shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all county development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Magistrate Court of Rockdale County. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
(b)
Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater manager, the county may elect to sue in the Superior Court of Rockdale County to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the county may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the county shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Rockdale County.
(c)
The county shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours and upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law.

(1)
Inspecting or conducting engineering tests on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site; or
(2)
Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
Sec. 310-141. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
(a)
The property owner, as identified from public land records of Rockdale County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property.
(1)
Billing. Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue October 1, 2005, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due.
(2)
The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected through the current county property tax billing system, or through another method, as deemed most effective and efficient by the board of commissioners. If the board of commissioners elects to include the stormwater user fee charge on the county's property tax bill, the stormwater user fee charge shall be paid in full before any payment is applied toward the property tax bill.
(3)
Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the board of commissioners.
(4)
Failure to receive a bill or receipt of an incorrect bill shall not be justification for nonpayment.
(5)
If a property is unbilled, if no bill is sent, or if the bill contains errors for a particular property, the Rockdale County Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties or be entitled to any interest for any delinquency during the back billed period.
(b)
Delinquencies and collection.
(1)
Unpaid fees shall be collected in any manner permissible by Georgia law, including but not limited to: utilizing the services of a collection agency; by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account; or by enforcement of any lien resulting from a judgment. In no instance shall the unpaid fee constitute a direct lien against the property.
(2)
A stormwater user fee charge shall be declared delinquent if not paid within 60 days of the due date specified on the billing document.
(3)
If suit is instituted for the collection of any fees due hereunder or for the enforcement of this article, the owner shall pay court costs, litigation expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees associated therewith.
(4)
Uncollected bills may be written off at the discretion of the board of commissioners following a recommendation from the stormwater director.
(c)
Adjustments. The stormwater manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge.
(1)
