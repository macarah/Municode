ARTICLE VIII. - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Sec. 54-121. - General benefits information.
Eligible employees of Stephens County government are provided a wide range of benefits. Eligibility for benefits is dependent upon a variety of factors, including employee classification. The hiring and classification issues section [article IV] of this handbook contains a description of each category and the associated benefits eligibility. Some benefit programs require contributions from employees, and some are fully or partially paid by the county. A number of programs (such as Social Security, worker's compensation, and unemployment insurance) cover all employees in the manner prescribed by law.
Benefits represent a significant portion of each employee's overall compensation package. Employees are encouraged to become familiar with the benefit programs for which they are eligible, and take advantage of these valuable benefits. Contact the human resources office for additional information and answers to specific questions about benefits issues.

Sec. 54-123. - Vacation leave.
(a)
General. Stephens County recognizes that employees need time away from work for rest and recreation and to manage personal business. The county provides paid vacation leave benefits to eligible employees within the guidelines presented in this policy.
(b)
Eligibility. All regular full-time employees will be eligible to earn and accrue vacation leave benefits, according to the schedule listed below.
Table H. 3-1 Vacation Leave Accruals
EXPAND
Years of Employment Annual Accrual Maximum Accrual

After 10 years 15 days/year (or 10 hours/mo.) 2 ½ days
  (c)
Calculation and accrual of vacation leave.
(1)
Eligible employees will begin to accrue vacation benefits as of the day of employment in the eligible position. However, accrued benefits are not available to be used or paid until the employee completes the probation period.
(2)
For the purpose of calculating vacation leave, those employees employed after the first day of the month, but before the 15th day of the month, will earn leave from the first of the month. Those employees employed after the 15th day of the month will not earn leave for that month.
(3)
Vacation leave may not be taken until it is earned.
(4)
Overtime is not included in computation of vacation leave accrual.
(5)
If an employee takes extended leave without pay (more than two weeks), there is no accrual of vacation leave benefits during that time.
(6)
If an employee is terminated and rehired, the date of last employment is used to compute vacation leave.
(d)
Status of vacation leave during probation period. Employees accrue, but may not take, vacation leave during the probation period. If the employee should separate from service during the probation period, or if the employee is not offered continued employment at the end of the probation period, they will not be paid for the leave accrued during the probation period.
(e)
Approval. Taking leave is a privilege that must be approved by the department head before the leave is taken, or within eight hours after returning to work in the case of an emergency. Taking more than five consecutive days of leave must be approved two weeks in advance. Employees on vacation leave are subject to recall to duty in cases of emergency.
(f)
Payment of vacation benefits. Vacation benefits are paid at the employee's base hourly rate of pay at the time of the vacation. The vacation pay rate does not include overtime or any special form of compensation such as shift differentials, incentives, commissions, or bonuses. Employees may not receive pay in lieu of taking vacation leave.
(g)
Maximum allowable accumulation. Stephens County's policies are designed to encourage employees to use their vacation leave each year. Employees are urged to take advantage of their annual vacation benefits for rest, relaxation, and personal pursuits. With this goal in mind, the county has established a maximum accrual of one and one-half times the employee's annual accrual rate of vacation leave (see Table H.3-1 in this section). In the event that an employee's accrued vacation is not used by the end of the benefit year:
(1)
Any unused amount not exceeding the maximum allowed accrual may be carried over to the next year.
(2)
Any unused exceeding the maximum allowed accrual will be forfeited.
(h)
Procedure to request vacation leave time. Requests for vacation leave should be submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor or department head. Vacation leave time may be granted, with approval of the appropriate department head, based on issues including: the department's staffing needs, the timeliness of request for leave time, and the employee's seniority. In case of inclement weather, employees who cannot get to work will be allowed to use vacation leave time.
(i)
Payment of vacation leave at termination of employment. After completion of the probation period, eligible employees will be eligible for compensation of accrued but unused vacation leave upon termination of employment (in the cast of death, accrued vacation will be paid to the employee's estate). Employees who have not completed their probation period will not be eligible to receive payment for unused vacation leave accruals.
The county commissioners will have the discretion of granting exceptions to the vacation policy (such as allowing additional vacation leave time to a new employee upon hiring, allowing carryover of vacation leave in excess of the maximum allowed accrual, or other exceptions).
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § H-3)
Sec. 54-124. - Sick leave.
Sick leave is accumulated to be taken for legitimate illness or injury, or other medical-related situations such as physician appointments, medical examinations, or dental appointments. Sick leave is available for the employee's personal health care as well as for care of members of the employee's immediate family. Employees are encouraged to accumulate and maintain sufficient balances of sick leave time to be prepared for unexpected illness, emergencies, or other personal needs.

Eligibility. All regular full-time employees are eligible to earn sick leave benefits, with accrual beginning as of the date of employment in the eligible position. Employees are not allowed to take accrued sick leave during the first six months of employment.

(3)
Maximum accumulation. A maximum of 36 days (or 288 hours) of sick leave may be accumulated. Accrued sick leave benefits may be carried from year to year, up to the maximum. Any sick leave accumulated in excess of the 36-day (288-hour) maximum will be forfeited.

Sec. 54-125. - Funeral leave.
Up to three days of funeral leave per occurrence may be available to eligible employees absent from work due to the death of an immediate family member.
(1)
Immediate family member. "Immediate family" includes the employee's spouse, parent, child, stepchild, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, or similar member of spouse's immediate family or other relative who lives in the employee's household. Special consideration may be given to a relative who is domiciled in the employee's household or any other person whose association with the employee was similar to any of the above relationships.
(2)
Eligibility. Regular full-time employees are eligible to receive up to three working days of funeral leave benefits per occurrence or as otherwise approved by the county administrator.
(3)
Procedure to request funeral leave. To request time off due to the death of an immediate family member, the eligible employee should immediately notify his/her supervisor who will forward it to the county administrator for approval. Approval of funeral leave will normally be granted, unless there are unusual business needs or staffing requirements. Employees may, with supervisory approval, use available vacation leave for additional time off as necessary.
(4)
Payment of funeral leave benefits. Funeral leave benefits are paid at the employee's base hourly rate of pay at the time of the absence. The funeral leave pay rate does not include overtime or any special form of compensation such as incentives, bonuses, or shift differentials. Funeral leave compensation will not be advanced to any employee. Funeral leave benefits are available only at the time or a death in the family, and only once during a calendar year; and may never accrue, carry over to another year, or be payable at termination of employment.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § H-5)
Sec. 54-126. - Group insurance plans.
Stephens County offers a variety of options for medical, life, or other insurance coverage for eligible employees. Types of insurance plans available and various options within each plan may vary from year to year. The county typically pays for all (or the majority of) the employee's insurance premiums in a given plan and employees may have the option of purchasing additional individual or family coverage at group rates.
Insurance programs available to eligible employees may include: health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, vision insurance, short-term disability insurance, and/or long-term disability insurance. Information regarding insurance options and enrollment procedures is provided to new employees during the initial hire period. Eligible employees must complete appropriate enrollment forms within the designated time frame.
Annual enrollment sessions are typically conducted at a designated time each year, and employees may elect to change coverage only at that time (unless an employee should experience a qualifying life status event or family status change, as defined by plan documents during the plan year; in which case the employee may only change enrollment within 30 days of the qualifying event). Any employee who wishes to enter a plan after their new-hire enrollment period, or who wishes to upgrade any coverage, may be required to show evidence of insurability, which must be approved by the insurance carrier.
(1)
Insurance benefits during unpaid leave of absence. A participating employee who is placed on unpaid leave of absence status is required to pay for both the employee's share and the county's share of his/her insurance premiums, or coverage will be terminated. The employee should make advance arrangements to pay premiums directly to the county, to avoid loss of important benefits.
(2)
Continuation of insurance benefits. Groups insurance benefits will terminate when an employee terminates employment. However, the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees and their qualified dependents the opportunity to continue medical insurance coverage under the county's health plan when a "qualifying event" would normally result in the loss of eligibility. Typical qualifying events include resignation, termination or employment, death of an employee, change in eligibility status, leave of absence, divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child no longer meeting eligibility requirements. Under COBRA, the employee or dependent pays the full cost of coverage at the county's group rates, plus an administration fee. Employees should notify the human resources office of any change in personal status which might affect their benefits. The county will provide a written notice describing rights granted under COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under the county's health plan. Contact the human resources office for questions or additional information about COBRA or any other benefits issues.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § H-6)
Sec. 54-127. - Worker's compensation insurance.
Stephens County operates under Georgia workers' compensation law. An employee who is temporarily disabled because of an injury or illness sustained directly in the performance of his or her work may be covered by the provisions of the State Workers' Compensation Act. Rules and regulations of the Act will govern all workers' compensation issues. Workers must report all accidents immediately to the employer by personally advising the employer.
Employee safety at work is important, and safety standards and procedures should be followed at all times. In the event of a compensable injury, workers' compensation provides payment of medical and rehabilitation expenses within the limits of the law. In some cases the county will also pay part of wages lost due to the work-related injury. The amount of benefits payable and duration of payment depend on the nature of injury or illness. In general, however, all eligible medical expenses incurred in connection with a work-related injury or illness is paid in full and appropriate salary payments are provided in accordance with workers' compensation laws.
(1)
Reporting an accident or injury. Any employee who is injured on the job must immediately report such injury to the immediate supervisor and/or department head, regardless of how minor the injury may appear to be. This ensures prompt and appropriate medical treatment, allows for timely completion of required reports in accordance with law, and enables an eligible employee to qualify for coverage as quickly as possible. The worker may lose the right to receive compensation if an accident is not reported with 30 days. Work injuries and occupation diseases should be reported in writing whenever possible. The county will supply free of charge, upon request, a form for reporting accidents; and will also furnish, free of charge information about workers' compensation.
(2)
Use of designated physicians. A worker injured on the job must select a doctor from the panel of physicians, which is posted in each department. If an employee chooses to visit a physician who is not on the panel of physicians, the employee will be liable for any medical expenses incurred. The panel physician may arrange for appropriate consultations, referrals, and other specialized services as the nature of the injury requires. If the employee is dissatisfied with the physician selected, he or she may make one change without permission of the employer/insurer, self-insurer claims office, or the State Board of Workers' Compensation.
(3)
Postaccident drug testing for accidents or injuries. All employees involved in work-related accidents or injuries are subject to postaccident drug screening testing (as described in article III, Drug-Free Workplace).
(4)
Return to work. All employees who have lost time due to work-related injury or illness must obtain a doctor's statement for the time missed and a "release statement" to return to work. Doctor's notes that specify "light duty" restrictions must be adhered to by both the employee and the supervisor. Employees who are in a nonpay status due to an injury will not accrue vacation or sick leave, and are not eligible for holiday pay.
(5)
Off-duty activities. Neither the county nor its worker's compensation insurance carrier will be liable for payment of worker's compensation benefits for injuries that occur during an employee's voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by the county.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § H-7)
Sec. 54-128. - Training and development.
Stephens County government promotes training and development of its employees for the purpose of improving the quality of services provided to the community and to assist employees in preparing themselves for advancement. To that end, the county may:

Determine appropriate standards for training programs;
(2)

(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § H-8)
Sec. 54-129. - Tuition reimbursement program.
At the discretion of the county administrator or his/her designee, the county may agree to grant time off and to pay registration, tuition, and travel costs for employees to attend approved educational programs that directly relate to their jobs and for which a direct benefit can be derived by the county.
Should any employee voluntarily leave employment with the county within one year of the training, the county reserves the right to deduct the expenses for the physical exam and drug screen test from the employee's final paycheck. This right extends to two years for state-mandated certification and/or licenses relating to positions in public safety.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § H-9)
Sec. 54-130. - Retirement program.
The county offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in the county's retirement/deferred compensation plan after completion of six months of employment, and after reaching 20½ years of age. Employees will be notified when they meet the eligibility requirements, and will receive information regarding retirement plan features, options, and procedures.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § H-10)
Sec. 54-131. - Carry-home vehicles.
Stephens County may provide certain employees with a county vehicle as part of the employee's compensation and benefits package. In such cases where the employee is allowed to use the vehicle for personal use, the value of the personal use is considered a taxable benefit and must be reported to the IRS.
The employee is required to report to the county the portion of the annual lease value of the vehicle that is used for personal reasons as described under IRS rules. The portion of the annual lease value that is of a personal usage will be reported on the employee's W-2 form to the IRS. In addition, since the county provides operation and maintenance of the vehicle, the employee must maintain a record of mileage related to the personal usage, which must be reported by the county as income at per-mile rate (currently $0.5.5 per mile). The benefit gained by the employee for personal use of a county vehicle during the each calendar year must be reported on the employee's W-2 form for that calendar year.
