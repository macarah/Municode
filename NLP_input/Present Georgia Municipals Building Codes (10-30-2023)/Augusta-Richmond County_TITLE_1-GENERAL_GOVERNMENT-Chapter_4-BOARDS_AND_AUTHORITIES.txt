(b)
Upon formal charges being filed with the Mayor of the Augusta-Richmond County Commission relative to a violation of the Code of Ethics set forth in subsection (a) hereof on the part of a member of any such board, Commission, committee, panel, authority, or other entity appointed by the Augusta-Richmond County Commission, the Augusta-Richmond Commission shall conduct a hearing for the purpose of receiving evidence relative to the merits of such charges.

Any member removed from such entity shall have the right to judicial review of such decision by the Augusta-Richmond County Commission by the filing of a petition within thirty (30) days after the service of the final decision of the Commission, or if a rehearing is requested, within thirty (30) days after the decision thereon. The petition shall be filed in the Superior Court of Richmond County, Georgia. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the Mayor of the Augusta-Richmond County Commission. The petition shall state the nature of petitioner's interest, the facts showing that the petitioner is aggrieved by the decision, and the ground as specified herein upon which the petitioner contends that the decision shall be reversed or modified.

(c)
The filing of the petition does not itself stay enforcement of the decision of the Commission. Except as otherwise provided, the Commission may grant, or the reviewing Court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown.
(d)
Within thirty (30) days after the service of the petition or within further time allowed by the Court, the Commission shall transmit to the reviewing Court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceeding under review.

A party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the Court for the additional costs. The Court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record.
(e)
If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the Court for leave to present additional evidence and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the additional evidence is material and there were good reasons for failure to present it in the proceedings before the Commission, the Court may order that the additional evidence be taken upon conditions determined by the Court. The Commission may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings, or decisions with the reviewing Court.
(f)
The review shall be conducted by the Court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. In case of alleged irregularities in procedure before the Commission, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the Court. The Court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.
(g)
The Court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The Court may affirm the decision of the Commission. The Court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of the Commission are: (1) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the Commission; (3) made upon unlawful procedures; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of the whole record; or (6) arbitrary and capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.

Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. The rules of evidence as applied in the trial of civil nonjury cases in the superior courts shall be followed. When necessary to ascertain facts not reasonably susceptible of proof under such rules, evidence not admissible thereunder may be admitted, except where precluded by statute, if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of their affairs or it consists of a report of medical, psychiatric, or psychological evaluation of a type routinely submitted to and relied upon by an agency in the normal course of its business. Agencies shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record.

It has heretofore been determined by the City Council of Augusta (the "City of Augusta" being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "City") that there is an existing and urgent need to provide incentives for the investment of funds for the rehabilitation and the redevelopment of the central business district of the City.
It has further been determined and declared that adequate financing for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of the central business district of the City cannot be provided through the ordinary operation of private enterprise, and the involvement of a public agency as herein contemplated in such an undertaking would not be competitive with private enterprise.
The City Council of Augusta has heretofore determined that there is a need for a downtown Development Authority to function in the City to help finance the cost of rehabilitation and redevelopment of the central business district of the City.
The City Council of Augusta, after a thorough study and investigation, has heretofore determined that it is desirable and necessary that a Downtown Development Authority be activated to function in the City with the powers granted it by the Act to issue Revenue Bonds and bond anticipation notes for the purpose of providing funds to finance the cost of rehabilitation and redevelopment of the central business district of the City.
It has heretofore been determined and declared a pressing, existing and future need for a Downtown Development Authority (as more fully described in the Act) to function in the City for the purpose of providing adequate financing for the rehabilitation and redevelopment of the central business district of the City, thereby promoting the welfare of the people of the City of Augusta.

The public body corporate and politic known as the "Downtown Development Authority of the City of Augusta" (hereinafter referred to as the "Authority"), which Authority was created pursuant to the Act, Georgia Laws 1981 p. 1744 et seq. heretofore activated, shall continue in existence. Said Act shall, by reference, be incorporated herein and made a part hereof.
