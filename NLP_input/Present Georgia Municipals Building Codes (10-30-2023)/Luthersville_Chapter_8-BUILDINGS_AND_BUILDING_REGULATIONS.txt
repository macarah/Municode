( Ord. No. 2020-7 , § 1(1.1), 9-8-2020)
Sec. 8-22. - Findings and intent.
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety.
(1)
The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners.
(2)
Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of vacant properties, property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted.
(3)
Improperly maintained and secured vacant properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of vacant real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article.
(4)
This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of municipal code (or ordinances) of the City of Luthersville, Georgia.
