Editor's note— Ord. No. 753 , pt. I, amended Art. VIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. VIII, §§ 22-300—22-312 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from: Ord. No. 481, § I, adopted Dec. 21, 1999; Ord. No. 723 , pts. I—XIII, adopted Sept. 20, 2016; Ord. No. 733 , pts. I—XIII, adopted Feb. 21, 2017; and Ord. No. 740 , pts. I, II, adopted Aug. 15, 2017.

Sec. 22-300. - Purpose and legislative findings.
The Georgia General Assembly has declared that the practice of massage therapy is an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety and welfare of the public and that the practice of massage therapy by a person who is not licensed under the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 43-24A-1 et seq.) is a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety and welfare. The city council agrees with those findings. Furthermore, the city council finds that, while there are many excellent and professionally-run massage establishments, the business of some massage/spa establishments is sexual conduct or the intimation of sexual conduct, rather than lawful massage therapy. Such establishments offer massage or spa services as a subterfuge for prostitution, masturbation for hire, and other paid sexual contact, which are harmful to the public health, safety and welfare. There is difficulty and expense in conclusively distinguishing between such establishments and legitimate massage establishments, but one rational distinction is whether the establishment has a relationship with a corporate or franchising hierarchy, which would tend to safeguard against unlawful sexual activities on the massage establishment premises. It is a purpose of this article to impose licensing requirements to help prevent illegal massage, prostitution, and related sex crimes, yet without hindering legitimate massage establishments operating under a business structure with external oversight that serves that purpose. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22 (allowing local regulation of massage businesses and of persons not licensed by the state), it is the purpose of this article to regulate the operation of massage establishments and spa establishments, and to regulate employees of such establishments who are not licensed as massage therapists by the state, as an exercise of the city's police power in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city.
