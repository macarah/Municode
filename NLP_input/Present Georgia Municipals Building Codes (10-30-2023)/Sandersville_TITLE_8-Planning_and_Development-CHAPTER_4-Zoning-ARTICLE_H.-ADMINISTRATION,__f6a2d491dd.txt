A building hereafter erected;
b.
A building hereafter altered so as to affect height, the side, front or rear yard; or
c.
Any building or premises where a change in the type of occupancy or use will occur.
(2)
Issuance of certificate of occupancy. Upon payment of any required fees, the zoning administrator shall sign and issue a certificate if the proposed use of land or building as stated on the certificate of occupancy is signed thereto by the owner or his appointed agent and is found to conform to the applicable provisions of this chapter, and if the building, as finally constructed, complies with the sketch or plan submitted and approved for the building permit. One (1) copy of all certificates of occupancy issued which contain a statement of the intended use of the applicable property, floor loads, and other pertinent information, signed by the owner or his agent shall be kept on file in the office of the zoning administrator.
(3)
Denial of certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless the proposed use of a building or land conforms to the applicable provisions of this chapter, and the structure conforms with the applicable provisions of the building code and complies with the sketches or plans submitted for obtaining the building permit.
(4)
Right of entry. Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the zoning administrator has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in or upon any building, structure, or premises any condition or code violation which makes such building, structure, or premises unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous, the zoning administrator may enter such building, structure, or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the zoning administrator by this chapter, provided that if such building, structure, or premises is occupied, the zoning administrator shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure, or premises is unoccupied, the zoning administrator shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such and request entry. If entry is refused, the zoning administrator shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry.
(5)
Revocation of certificate of occupancy. The zoning administrator may revoke a certificate of occupancy upon determination that there exists in or upon the building, structure, or premises any use, condition, or code violation which makes such building, structure, or premises unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous for habitation. Written notice of the revocation shall be given to the owner and occupant of the building, structure, or premises five (5) days in advance of the revocation becoming effective. Any occupancy or use of the building, structure, or premises thereafter shall be in violation of this chapter. At such time as the property for which the certificate of occupancy has been revoked has been brought into compliance with the applicable state minimum standard codes and the ordinances of the City and is safe for habitation, and upon payment of the established fee for issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the certificate of occupancy shall be reinstated.
(6)
Authority to disconnect utility services. Upon revocation of the certificate of occupancy of any building, structure, or premises regulated by this chapter, the zoning administrator shall have the power to require the disconnection of utility services to such building, structure, or premises. The zoning administrator shall notify the owner and occupant of the building, structure, or premises of the decision to disconnect prior to the disconnection or as soon as practical thereafter.
(7)
Appeal of revocation or disconnection of utility services. The decision of the zoning administrator to revoke a certificate of occupancy or to require the disconnection of utility services to a building, structure, or premises may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8-4-132 of this chapter.
