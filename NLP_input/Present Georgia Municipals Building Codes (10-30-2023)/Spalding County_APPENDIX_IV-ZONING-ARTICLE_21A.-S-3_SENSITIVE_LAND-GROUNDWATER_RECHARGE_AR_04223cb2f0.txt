ARTICLE 21A. - S-3 SENSITIVE LAND-GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION DISTRICT

Sec. 2101A. - Purpose.
The purpose of the S-3 district is to protect those lands identified as recharge areas for underground reservoirs known as aquifers. In order to promote the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Spalding County and surrounding communities, its is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources on which Spalding County and surrounding communities rely as sources of public water.
Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(Res. No. A-01-03, § 1, 8-6-01)
Sec. 2102A. - Relationship to other zoning districts.
The S-3 groundwater recharge area protection district, is an overlay district which shall include all lands within the jurisdiction of Spalding County, Georgia that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 Edition, which map is hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. The S-3 groundwater recharge area protection district applies additional definitions and standards for development to specific areas which lie within any of the zoning districts identified in this ordinance and which are additionally mapped as significant recharge areas, as shown on Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 Edition.
(Res. No. A-01-03, § 1, 8-6-01)
