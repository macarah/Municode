ARTICLE 2. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS

Section 340-16. - Introduction.
(a)
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments;
(2)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters;
(3)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(4)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system; and
(5)
The City is required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
(b)
Therefore, the City Council adopts this Article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

Editor's noteâ€” Ch. 340, Art. 4 was formerly entitled "Post-Development Stormwater Management," which was retitled as herein set out by Ord. No. 776 .

Section 340-36. - Introduction.
(a)
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition;
(2)
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(3)
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(4)
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits;
(5)
The City is required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; and
(6)
Therefore, the City has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 340-37. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this Article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This Article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable;
(6)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.
(b)
Applicability.
(1)
This Article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to Subsections (b)(2) or (3) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria:
a.
New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of 10,000 square feet or more. If the development adds between 1,000 square feet and 5,000 square feet, then only runoff reduction and water quality as per Code Section 340-39(a)(1) is required. All site improvements must be evaluated for impacts to surface flow characteristics.
b.
Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition and/or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of 10,000 square feet or more. If the redevelopment adds or replaces between 1,000 square feet and 5,000 square feet, then only runoff reduction and water quality as per Code Section 340-39(a)(1) is required. All site improvements must be evaluated for impacts to surface flow characteristics.
c.
Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the Public Works Director to be a hotspot land use; or
d.
Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in Subsections (b)(1)a. and (b)(1)b. above, if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
e.
Linear transportation projects that exceed the threshold in (a) or (b) above.
(2)
The following activities are exempt from this Article:
a.
Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities;
b.

The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this Article:
(1)
Stormwater Runoff Quality/Reduction: Stormwater Runoff Quality/Reduction shall be provided by using the following:
a.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before January 1, 2020, the applicant may choose either: (A) Runoff Reduction; or (B) Water Quality.
b.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after January 1, 2020, the applicant shall choose (A) Runoff Reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. If (A) Runoff Reduction has been determined to be infeasible using the Practicability Policy per 340-39(b), then (B) Water Quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80% of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
1.
Runoff Reduction - The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
2.
Water Quality - The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80% of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in Section 300-3, the City may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(2)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
b.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity;
c.
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(3)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to at least 90 percent of the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under Subsection 340-39(a)(2) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. If structural stormwater controls are implemented within the stormwater management plan that promote infiltration, the City Engineer may allow the post-development peak discharge rate to not exceed the pre-development rate of the current existing condition, regardless of the amount of impervious area to be removed and replaced on-site.
(4)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(5)

Sections 340-43â€”340-45. - Reserved.
ARTICLE 5. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Section 340-46. - Findings.
(a)
The Mayor and City Council make the following findings:
(1)
The City is authorized by the supplementary powers provisions of Article IX, section II, paragraph III(a)(6) of the Georgia Constitution to provide a stormwater collection and disposal system throughout the city.
(2)
The federal Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. Â§ 1251 et seq.) and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasizes the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs which address water quality and the impact of stormwater runoff.
(3)
Stormwater management services and facilities will assist the City in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the City.
(4)
The City presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the City, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the City in concert with the management of other water resources in the City. To do so, the City must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program's operating needs and capital.
(5)
Stormwater management services and facilities are needed throughout the City because most of those areas are developed. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the City is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(6)
The provision of stormwater management services and facilities in the City promotes an essential regulatory purpose by controlling where stormwater runoff flows and how it is disposed, and thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water pollution caused by stormwater runoff.
(7)
Stormwater management services and facilities will provide a specific service to property owners by assisting in the property owner's legal obligation to control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that runoff does not flow upon their neighbors in greater quantities than it would if the property were in an undeveloped state. By mitigating the impact of stormwater runoff from developed property, the stormwater management system helps prevent damage that would subject a property owner to civil liability.
(8)
The City is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, and finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City to proceed with the development, implementation, and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the City budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith.
(9)
The City has undertaken a comprehensive review by staff and professional consultants of the need for, management of, and funding for, a stormwater utility. The staff reports and the professional engineering and financing feasibility analysis properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the City.
(10)
As a result, the City finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and facilities, and finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the City.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 807 , pt. I, 4-19-22)
Section 340-47. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund.
(a)
There is hereby established a stormwater management utility within the city which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the City's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. Such utility shall be under the direction of a stormwater utility director, appointed by the Planning and Development Director.
(b)
The Planning and Development Director shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the City budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including, but not limited to, rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses as may be established by the City Council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated and expended exclusively for purposes of the utility, including capital project construction. No other funds of the City shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues, except that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including grants, loans and bond proceeds may be combined with and applied to stormwater management capital projects as deemed appropriate by the City Council, upon recommendation of the stormwater utility director.
(c)
The City Council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility director operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the City and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights of entry and access, and certain equipment.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18; Ord. No. 807 , pt. I, 4-19-22)
Section 340-48. - Scope of responsibility for the drainage system in the city.
(a)
The City drainage system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or manmade, within the political boundaries of the City which control and/or convey stormwater through which the City intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The City owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which:
(1)
Are located within public streets, rights-of-way and easements;
(2)
Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or
(3)
Are located on public lands to which the City has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities.
(b)
Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, or its occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the state and the Unites States of America.
(c)
It is the intent of this Article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the City. The City expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the City, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may not exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the City as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the City, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the City or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the City, its officers, employees oragents.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 807 , pt. I, 4-19-22)
Section 340-49. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections.
All property owners and developers of developed real property within the city shall provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City development regulations and the laws of the state and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the City in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the City may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of the filing of such action, the City shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court of the county. The City shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this Article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the City, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 340-50. - Determination and modification of stormwater service charges.

(a)
A stormwater service charge bill may be sent through the United States Mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the county, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the City may back-bill for a period of up to four years, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A 1.5 percent late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service charge that becomes delinquent.
(b)
Suit for collection shall be commenced by the City in the court of the owner's residence; provided, however, if the owner is not a resident of this state, suit may be filed in the superior court of the county.

ARTICLE 6. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Section 340-66. - Title of article, findings and objectives.
(a)
This Article shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of the City of Chamblee, Georgia.
(b)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the City and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(c)
The objectives of this Article are:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting destiny of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 340-67. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district.
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which all shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 Edition.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 340-68. - Determination of pollution susceptibility.
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 340-69. - Permit requirements and enforcement.
(a)
