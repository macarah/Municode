Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-12, adopted May 28, 2009, added new provisions which were designated as art. II; therefore the designation of sections 50-1—50-3 as art. I was added at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 50-1. - Miscellaneous provisions not affected by Code.
Nothing in this Code or in the resolution adopting this Code shall affect:
(1)
Resolution Number 92-6, adopted April 14, 1992, which adopted by reference the White County Comprehensive Plan 2010, or any amendment thereto.
(2)
Resolution Number 94-6, adopted January 27, 1994, which adopted by reference the Mountain and River Corridor Protection Plans as an amendment to the White County Comprehensive Plan, or any amendment thereto.
All such resolutions are hereby recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out in this Code.
Sec. 50-2. - Development agreement.
(a)
Definition. A development agreement is a negotiated agreement between the county and a developer. It shall include large-scale development that will be phased and constructed over an extended period of time. The development agreement shall be in demand by developers to bring certainty to this Code that will govern the development over the established time. In reciprocating to "lock in" the current development regulations for the development over the established time period, the county shall receive agreement from the developer to install infrastructure or take other agreed upon actions that further the public interest.
(b)
Title. This section shall be the "Development Agreement Resolution of White County, Georgia".
(c)
Findings.
(1)
The development agreement shall be employed at the discretion of the county where a developer proposes a guarantee that the county's current land use and development regulations shall remain fixed during the established time period of the prospective land development.
(2)
The county, conversely, shall seek concessions and land development conditions beyond what it could reasonably require through current regulations under the normal exercise of its authority or police power.
(3)
Developers shall voluntarily enter into a development agreement with the county that will limit the property use(s), and may specify other limitations, even though the county does not have regulations governing land use as of June 6, 2006. In return the development agreement shall benefit the developer by "locking in" the development regulations that apply to a particular development even in the event that the county subsequently adopts land use regulations.
(4)
Developers shall also enter voluntarily into a development agreement with the county for two other important reasons even if no land use regulations currently apply to a proposed development.
a.
The developer may need the cooperation of the county in extending infrastructure, and such cooperation may not be forthcoming in the absence of concessions voluntarily submitted to by the developer in the form of a development agreement.
b.
Knowledge of a pending development may stir public interest and even if the county has no land use regulations, the development agreement becomes a flexible negotiating instrument whereby the developer can submit to certain concessions, i.e. limits on land uses that will satisfy neighborhood concerns.
(5)
The county similarly shall voluntarily enter into a development agreement in certain instances. The county may have an interest in limiting land uses in order to protect the health safety and welfare of county citizens. Without the mechanism of a development agreement and in the absence of land use regulations, the county has no control over the quality, extent and location of a proposed development. The county shall also support entering into development agreements in cases where infrastructure to serve the development may be necessary, but no existing regulation exists to require such improvements.
(6)
The county board of commissioners therefore finds that a negotiated development agreement, voluntarily submitted by a development applicant and involving infrastructure improvements and limits on land use and development regulations, shall be in the best interests of the county and the development community and within the proper scope of the county's police powers.
(d)
Purpose.
(1)
The purpose of a development agreement is to:
a.
Vest certain development rights in the landowner/developer in exchange for construction and dedication of public improvements, certain restrictions on land uses and other concessions on the part of developer.
b.
Allow the developer who needs additional discretionary approval now or in the future to acquire long-term project approval, regardless of any local regulations subsequently adopted.
c.
Provide assurances that the applicant may proceed with the project in accordance with all applicable local statues, resolutions, rules and policies in existence at the time the development agreement is executed and that the project will not be restricted or prohibited by the county's subsequent enactment or adoption of laws, resolutions, rules or policies.
d.
Derive public benefits that may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on land uses, limits on development intensity and location, design standards and on and off site infrastructure and other improvements.
(2)
The county is ensured a mechanism for negotiating such benefits in return for the vesting of development rights for a specific period.
(3)
It is therefore the specific purpose of this section to authorize the county board of commissioners to exercise its police powers to enter into individual development agreements and to specify the content and procedures for such development agreements.
(e)
Authority to enter into development agreements. The county board of commissioners hereby exercises its police powers to negotiate and enter into a voluntary development agreement upon application of a developer. The procedure for entering into a development agreement and the contents of any development agreement shall be consistent with the requirements of this resolution.
(f)
Application. Any person having a legal or equitable interest in real property which meet or exceed the development of regional impact (DRI) threshold, as administered by the state department of community affairs, may make application to enter into a development agreement with the county. The county shall establish an application fee to recover the direct costs associated with holding a public hearing and providing notice thereof.
(g)
Required contents of a development agreement. Any application for a development agreement, and any development agreement itself, shall contain at minimum the following provisions:
(1)
Definitions. The agreement shall contain a definition of all technical terms and define terms found in applicable statutes or resolutions the same way.

The agreement shall be a covenant running with the land, recorded upon the title records that the agreement and all covenants apply to the property. The county shall be notified 90 days prior to any transfer or reassignment of any or all portions of the real property affected by a development agreement;
d.
Time deadlines for action by the developer or property owner; and
e.
A statement that failure to meet the time deadlines may cause the agreement to terminate.
(6)
Recitation of benefits and burdens.
a.
The agreement shall recite the benefits each party expects to gain from entering into the agreement as well as the burdens each party agrees to bear.
b.
Because the agreement is a contract, the consideration each party is to receive from the other shall be stated clearly in order to ensure enforceability.

The sign shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing.
(8)
Applicable land use regulations.
a.
The agreement shall contain a precise statement of all land use and development regulations to which the development project will be subject. The agreement shall specify precisely which regulations will apply to the project regardless of future changes or otherwise affected by the agreement. The statement shall clearly state that regulations not specifically so identified that will not be affected by the terms of the agreement, and will be subject to enforcement and change under the same criteria that would apply if no agreement were in effect. The development agreement shall specify that, unless otherwise provided, the rules, regulations, official policies governing permitted uses of the land governing density, design, improvement and construction standards and specifications applicable to the development of the property subject to a development agreement, shall be those rules, regulations and official policies in force at the time of execution of the agreement.

(11)
Improper operation of facilities engaged in the land application of human waste and septage or commercial waste, or both, can result in toxic areas or brown fields. Therefore prior to the issuance of a special use permit and land compliance letter by the county, an applicant for said letter must demonstrate the existence of an adequate financial responsibility mechanism to demonstrate that sufficient funds will be available to meet specific environmental protection needs of said land application system site.
(12)
A special use permit and land compliance letter for the operation of a land application system for human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, shall not be granted unless the existence of an adequate financial responsibility mechanism has been provided to the White County Director of Planning and Development with the application. Such financial responsibility mechanism shall insure the satisfactory maintenance, closure, and post-closure care of such system site and the financial ability to carry out any corrective action, which is necessary to insure compliance with environmental standards after an incident, and which shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. The director of planning shall evaluate the sufficiency of the amount of the financial responsibility mechanism by consultation with a professional engineering firm knowledgeable in the field of brownfield reclamation and considering the following factors:
a.
The type of land application system;
b.
The type of waste to be land applied to the site;
c.
The effectiveness of the system;
d.
The volume of waste;
e.
The size of the land application areas;
f.
The estimated cost to remove any toxic or hazardous material; and
g.
Such other factors typically involved in brownfield reclamation.
Based upon these factors and the recommendation of the expert, the director of planning can recommend to the White County Board of Commissioners a higher amount for the financial responsibility mechanism which may be imposed as a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter by the board of commissioners. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit.

As a condition of the special use permit and land application letter, the applicant will covenant and warrant that all waste shall be tested to determine that the waste proposed to be treated is waste that the facility is permitted by EPD to treat, and does not contain any hazardous or toxic materials that would disrupt the treatment process of the land application facility or which the facility is not permitted to treat. It shall be a continuing condition of the permit for the facility to test all waste, and the failure of the facility to test all waste shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitled White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. Applicant as a part of the special use permit and land compliance letter application, shall covenant and warrant to provide copies of all test results, to a designated agent of White County on a monthly basis for all waste accepted for treatment by the facility, on the first day of the following month. Failure to provide the monthly reports shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit.

The timely provision of this documentation by applicant/permittee to White County is a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. The applicant/permittee shall provide to White County the documentation required by this subsection, at the same time that the applicant/permittee provides the reports and documentation to EPD.
(15)
The facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, under the rules and regulations of EPD is required to have a manifest of the waste transported to said facility. As a part of the monitoring of said facility, and as a continuing condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter by White County, applicant/permittee shall provide a copy of said manifest on a monthly basis to a designated agent of White County, with said manifest indicating the origination of the human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, the transporter for said waste, the amount of waste received, what type of waste received, a cross index to the pretesting requirement of said waste, and shall be provided on a monthly basis to a designated agent of White County on the first day of the following month. The operator of the facility shall have a right to designate parts of the manifest that meet the definition of confidential proprietary information as such information, and White County shall redact said confidential information from any copies of the manifest made available to the general public as a public record. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. The providing of the copies of the manifest by the applicant/permittee to White County shall be a part of the monitoring of the facility pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30.3(d), and will be in addition to any manifest requirements imposed by EPD.

(18)
a.
Following the public hearing concerning a special use permit and a land compliance letter application for a facility engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, the board of commissioners shall grant or deny the application based upon whether the board determines that the proposed facility is consistent with the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and consistent with the factors set out by this article, and can met the conditions required by this article. The board shall consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially with regard to traffic, noise, odors, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities including whether the area contains property primarily used for residential purposes. The board shall also consider the following criteria concerning the grant or denial of a special use permit and land compliance letter application for a facility engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both:
1.
The existing uses of nearby property and whether the proposed facility will adversely affect the existing use or usability of nearby property;
2.
The extent to which property values of the property upon which the facility is to be sited would be diminished by the conditions imposed by the special use permit and land compliance letter;
3.
The extent to which the destruction of the property values of the property upon which the facility is to be sited would promote the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public;
4.
The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner;
5.
The physical suitability of the subject property for the facility, and other possible uses as to which the property is suited;
6.
The length of time the property has been vacant, considered in the context of land development in the area near the property, and whether there are existing or changed conditions affecting the use and development of the property which gives supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the special use permit and land compliance letter application request;
7.
The development history and land use history of the subject property;
8.
The extent to which the proposed facility would result or could cause excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation, facilities, utilities, police protection, fire protection, public health facilities, emergency medical services, or other public facilities;
9.
Whether the proposed facility is in conformity with the policy and intent of the comprehensive plan, land use plan, or other adoptive plans;
10.
Whether the proposed facility is a use that is suitable in view of the use, development, and use of adjacent and nearby property;
11.
Whether the proposed site for the facility has a reasonable economic use currently;
12.
Whether the proposed facility would create an isolated commercial use unrelated to the surrounding uses;
13.
Whether the proposed facility is out of scale with the needs of the county as a whole or the immediate neighborhood; and
14.
Such other factors as are deemed relevant by the board of commissioners before taking action on a particular application.
b.
The board of commissioners shall adopt administrative policies regarding the conduct of the public hearing upon special use permit and land compliance letter applications but which do not conflict with the minimum requirements set by this article.
c.
In addition to the operational conditions imposed by subsection (a)(16), the board of commissioners may impose such other conditions upon the facility as are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of area residents, which are consistent with state and federal regulations. The board of commissioners shall make its decision to grant to deny the application immediately following the public hearing, unless the hearing reveals a need for additional information before a decision can be made, and at which event the application shall be tabled until the next regular meeting of the board and decided in that meeting.
In the event that the board of commissioners denies the application for a special use permit and land compliance letter or the applicant withdraws the application prior to the vote, the same property cannot be considered for a special use permit and land compliance letter until at least 12 months following the denial or withdrawal of the application.
(19)
The White County Planning Department shall issue written notification of the decision of the White County Board of Commissioners regarding an application for a special use permit and land compliance letter for a facility engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both. The planning department shall issue the written notification to applicant within five business days of the decision of the White County Board of Commissioners. The decision of the White County Board of Commissioners shall be the final administrative action by White County, but an applicant shall have a right to appeal the decision of the White County Board of Commissioners to the White County Superior Court by way of a writ of certiorari granted by the Superior Court. (See also section 50-12). Applicant shall follow the statutory process for the grant of a writ of certiorari by the Superior Court, including the provision of a bond that would cover the county's costs and expenses regarding the permit, including all of the costs to meet the conditions of the permit, as wexlll as the County's attorney fees and other expenses in having to respond to the appeal. If the Board of Commissioners of White County grants the special use permit and compliance letter, then the White County Building Department may issue a building permit for the facility upon the condition that all conditions of the permit will be met, and all requirements of all other county ordinances and regulations have been met. The building department following its standard process, shall also issue a certificate of completion and a certificate of occupancy for the facility upon the requirements and conditions of the special permit and compliance letter being met, as well as all other county ordinances and regulations applicable to said facility being met.
(20)
The special use permit and land compliance letter shall be valid for one year, and be subject to renewal upon the anniversary date of the grant of the permit, so long as the facility complies with the conditions required by the permit. The infrastructure improvements required to be constructed by the conditions of the permit must be constructed within one year of the issuance of the notification of the grant of the permit by the White County Board of Commissioners. It is the responsibility of the applicant to apply for the building permits required by the White County Building Department for the facility and pursuant to the county ordinances and regulations. Failure to complete the construction of the infrastructure within the one-year period will require the applicant to restart the process to receive a new special use permit and land compliance letter. Upon written application of a holder of a special use permit and land compliance letter submitted at least two months prior to the end of the one-year construction period, and for good cause shown, the board of commissioners in their discretion, may grant an extension of time to complete the infrastructure improvements upon the further condition that the applicant pay the annual monitoring and regulatory fee of $2,500.00 required by subsection (a)(21) at the time of requesting the extension. Failure to construct the infrastructure improvements within the one-year period of time, unless extended, shall be due cause for the board of commissioners to not issue a renewal of the permit upon its anniversary date (and with the board following the suspension or revocation process required by section 50-10). A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that the construction has not been completed within the time allowed shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to require the holder of the permit to stop work and begin again the process to be issued a new special use permit and land compliance letter.
(21)
Applicant for a special use permit and land compliance letter, at the time of submission of the application, shall also submit an application fee for said permit and land compliance letter in the amount of $5,000.00. Said fee is in part an application fee, but is also a regulatory fee and fee to offset the cost of monitoring the facility. In the event the board of commissioners denies the application, then the applicant shall receive a refund of $2,500.00. Should the board of commissioners grant the application, then the board shall retain the entire fee in order to offset the county's regulatory and monitoring costs of insuring compliance with this article by the applicant. Applicant at the time of application shall also make any disclosures required by the Conflict of Interest and Zoning Actions Act, being O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq. All local government officials required to make disclosure under said Act shall do so upon becoming aware of the application and the conflict of interest. The special use permit and land compliance letter shall only be valid for one year from the date of the grant of the application by the board of commissioners. One month prior to the annual anniversary date of the grant of the permit, and one month prior to each annual anniversary thereafter, the holder of the permit shall make a renewal application to receive another special use permit and land compliance letter valid for one year, and shall pay a regulatory and monitoring fee of $2,500.00 to White County. The renewal applicant upon the renewal application shall covenant and warrant that all conditions of the special use permit and the land compliance letter have been met in the prior year, and will be met in the year for which a renewal application is submitted. Upon receipt of the regulatory and monitoring fee, and upon verification that the permit conditions were met during the prior year, White County shall issue a special permit and land compliance letter for the renewal year. Violation of any conditions of the permit shall be due cause for suspension, revocation, or denial of the renewal of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension, revocation, or denial process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that any condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners to deny a renewal application, and also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to have the facility cease operations.
(22)
Besides the administrative relief of a stop work order, and the injunctive and other equitable relief allowed by this article to White County, any person violating any provision of this article, as such exists from time to time, shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of White County, and upon conviction of such violation shall be punishable as a misdemeanor, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60, subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and subject to imprisonment for no more than 60 days or both, except as otherwise provided by general law, or by subsequent amendment of O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60.

The applicant for a nonconforming use permit shall covenant and warrant upon his application that the applicant will meet the requirements of the subsections applicable to such facilities (being subsections (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15) and (22) of section 50-7(a)), and these applicable conditions shall be continuing conditions of the permit. The nonconforming use permit shall only be valid for one year from the date of the grant of the application by the board of commissioners. One month prior to the annual anniversary date of the grant of the permit, and one month prior to each annual anniversary thereafter, the holder of the permit shall make a renewal application to receive another nonconforming use permit valid for one year, and shall pay a regulatory and monitoring fee of $2,500.00 to White County. The renewal applicant upon the renewal application shall covenant and warrant that all conditions of the nonconforming use permit have been met in the prior year, and will be met in the year for which a renewal application is submitted. Upon receipt of the regulatory and monitoring fee, and upon verification that the permit conditions were met during the prior year, White County shall issue a nonconforming use permit for the renewal year. Violation of any conditions of the permit shall be due cause for suspension, revocation, or denial of the renewal of the nonconforming use permit after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension, revocation, or denial process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that any condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners to deny a renewal application, and also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to have the facility cease operations. Any facility operating under a nonconforming use permit that is destroyed or ceases operation for a month or more (excepting shortterm closures for normal maintenance of the facility), shall lose the right to continue operations as a nonconforming use and said facility must go through the special use permit and land compliance letter procedure and meet all conditions required by this article at the time of application in order to begin operations again.

Except as provided in section 50-11, no permit, or renewal permit, which has been issued or which may be issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended, revoked or denied (as to a renewal permit regarding the denial) except for due cause and after hearing and upon prior ten-day written notice to the holder of the permit of the time, place and purpose of the hearing, and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held.
(b)
The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to:
(1)
Determination of a violation of any federal law, state law, federal regulation, state regulation, or county ordinance regarding the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, including but not limited to the conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendre, or the entering into of a consent order, by the permittee or any of the permittee's employees or any person holding an interest in the permit as to a violation.
(2)
A determination of, including but not limited to conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendre, or the entering of a consent order, by the permittee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the permit for any violation of the facility's state permit regarding land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both.
(3)
Suspension, revocation, or the entering of a consent order regarding any state permit required as a condition for the operation of a land application system regarding human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both.
(4)
Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a permit or renewal permit issued under this article or bearing upon the permittee's qualification therefore.

(6)
Any other factor known to or discovered by White County whereby it is objectively shown the permittee, any of the permittee's employees or any person holding an interest in a permit, has engaged in conduct at or involving the permittee facility, or has permitted conduct on the permitted facility that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations regarding the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both. With respect to this subsection, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the permittee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such permittee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such permittee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.
(c)
Notice of the suspension or revocation of a permit, or the denial of a renewal permit, proceedings shall be served on the person named as permittee in the permit. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the permittee at its address as it appears in the records of White County.

At the hearing, the permittee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross-examine all witnesses offered by the county, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf.

(b)
A short-term emergency suspension by the board of commissioners must be for an emergency cause. Emergency cause for the short-term suspension of a permit shall consist of a violation of a permit condition which puts the county and the health and safety of its citizens at such risk that an immediate suspension is necessary until a hearing as provided for in section 50-10 can be held.
