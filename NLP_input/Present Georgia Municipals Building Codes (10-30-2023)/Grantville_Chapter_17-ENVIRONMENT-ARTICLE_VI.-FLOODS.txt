Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) of this section;
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the city.

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCES

Sec. 17-303. - Procedures.
The variance and appeals procedures set forth in this division shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. A request for a variance may be submitted as follows by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the city or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated hereinabove:
(1)
Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in a public hearing by mayor and council of the city. The hearing shall be advertised in the legal organ of the city no less than 15 and no more than 45 days from the date of the hearing and shall state the place and time of the hearing.
(2)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(3)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(4)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(5)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(6)
In reviewing such requests, the city and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(7)
Conditions for variances.
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
d.
The city manager or designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(8)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
(9)
Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (1) through (8) of this section and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article.
(10)
Variances shall not be issued after the fact.
