ARTICLE IV. - ELIGIBILITY, QUALIFICATION AND PARTICIPATION

Section 4.01. - Classes of Eligible Employees.
The Employer shall designate in the Adoption Agreement the class(es) of Employees which are eligible to participate in the Plan. Provided, however, that if a person does not meet the definition of "Employee" contained in Article II, he or she may not be included in any Eligible Employee class.
Section 4.02. - Qualifications for Participation.
(a)
Minimum Service Requirement. With respect to each class of Eligible Regular Employees, the Employer may specify in the Adoption Agreement a minimum number of hours per week and/or a minimum number of months per year which are required to be scheduled and worked in order to establish and maintain one's status as an Eligible Employee. It shall be the responsibility of the Adopting Employer to determine whether these requirements are and continue to be satisfied. In determining whether said requirements are satisfied, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
If an Employee is otherwise includable in an Eligible Regular Employee class, but he does not meet the minimum service requirements established by the Employer for said class pursuant to subsection (a) above, he or she shall not be considered an Eligible Employee, unless and until he satisfies such requirements. If an Eligible Regular Employee who has not yet become a Participant no longer meets said minimum service requirement, but he remains an Employee of the Employer, he or she shall no longer be considered an Eligible Regular Employee, unless and until he again satisfies the minimum requirement.
(2)
No period of employment during which an Employee fails to satisfy the Employer's minimum service requirement and no leave of absence granted to such Employee shall be counted in determining whether any waiting period for participation established by the Employer pursuant to subsection (b) below has been satisfied. However, provided the Employee remains continuously employed by the Employer, such periods shall not be considered a break in Service under subsection (b)(1) below for purposes of satisfying said waiting period.
(b)
Waiting Period. Unless otherwise specified by the Adopting Employer in an addendum to the Adoption Agreement, Eligible Regular Employees shall be required to complete one (1) year of continuous, uninterrupted Service with the Adopting Employer in order to commence participation in the Plan. In determining whether this waiting period has been satisfied, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Breaks in Service. If an Eligible Regular Employee has a break in Service prior to satisfying the waiting period for participation and later becomes reemployed by the Adopting Employer, he shall be required to again satisfy the waiting period in order to be eligible to participate in the Plan. Service rendered prior to said break in Service shall not be taken into account in determining whether the waiting period has been satisfied.
(2)
Employed on Effective Date; Waiting Period Satisfied. If an Eligible Regular Employee is employed by the Adopting Employer on the Effective Date of the Plan and he has completed a period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Employee immediately prior to the Effective Date equal to or exceeding the length of the required waiting period, then he shall be considered to have satisfied the waiting period and he shall be eligible to commence participation in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the Effective Date of the Plan.
(3)
Employed on Effective Date; Waiting Period Not Satisfied. If an Eligible Regular Employee is employed by the Adopting Employer on the Effective Date of the Plan, but he has not completed a period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Regular Employee immediately prior to the Effective Date equal to or exceeding the length of the required waiting period, then he shall be eligible to commence participation in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date that he completes the minimum period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Regular Employee necessary to satisfy the required waiting period.
(4)
Employed After the Effective Date. If an Eligible Regular Employee is initially employed by the Adopting Employer after the Effective Date of the Plan, he shall be eligible to commence participation in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date that he completes the minimum period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Regular Employee necessary to satisfy the required waiting period.
(5)
Treatment of Leaves of Absence. For purposes of determining whether the waiting period for participation has been satisfied, Service shall include any period of absence from employment which is required to be taken into account for such purpose under USERRA, the FMLA, or any other applicable federal or state law. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, an authorized leave of absence granted to an Eligible Regular Employee by the Adopting Employer shall be counted as Credited Service for purposes of determining whether the waiting period for participation has been satisfied. However, unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, if an Eligible Regular Employee on an authorized leave of absence fails to return to active employment upon expiration of the leave of absence, the Eligible Regular Employee shall be considered to have incurred a break in Service for purposes of meeting the waiting period for participation as of the date preceding the approved leave period.
(6)
Treatment of Service as an Ineligible Employee. If an Employee of the Adopting Employer who is not an Eligible Employee becomes an Eligible Regular Employee while remaining continuously employed by the Adopting Employer, said Eligible Employee shall become eligible to commence participation on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date he meets the eligibility requirements for participation under this Article. For purposes of satisfying any waiting period imposed by the Adopting Employer, and unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, the Eligible Regular Employee's prior period of employment as an Ineligible Employee shall be credited in the same manner as Service as an Eligible Regular Employee, provided that during said prior period of service as an Ineligible Employee, he satisfied any minimum service requirement established by the Employer pursuant to Section 4.02(a). Unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, if an Eligible Regular Employee becomes an Ineligible Employee prior to satisfying the waiting period for participation in the Plan, his service as an Ineligible Employee shall be credited in the same manner as Service as an Eligible Regular Employee for purposes of satisfying said waiting period, provided that the Ineligible Employee satisfies the applicable minimum service requirements established for Eligible Employees pursuant to Section 4.02(a). However, in no event will an Ineligible Employee be permitted to become a Participant in the Plan unless and until he has satisfied the waiting period and has again become an Eligible Employee. For purposes of satisfying the waiting period, leaves of absence granted to an Ineligible Employee shall be treated in the same manner as leaves of absence for Eligible Regular Employees under paragraph (5) above.
(7)
Prior Participation in Another GMEBS Plan. An Eligible Regular Employee who is hired after the Effective Date of the Plan shall be eligible to become a Participant on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date on which he is employed by the Adopting Employer, regardless of any waiting period requirement established by the Employer, provided that: (i) his immediate prior employment was with another employer in the GMEBS; (ii) he was a Participant in the previous employer's GMEBS Plan; and (iii) he satisfies any minimum service requirement established by the Adopting Employer pursuant to Section 4.02(a) for his class.
Section 4.03. - Establishing Participation in the Plan.
(a)
Mandatory vs. Optional Participation. Participation in the Plan shall be considered mandatory for all classes of Eligible Employees unless, with respect to a particular class, the Employer specifies in the Adoption Agreement that participation is optional for members of said class.
(b)
Mandatory Participation. If participation is mandatory for a class of Eligible Employees, then all Eligible Employees in the class shall become Participants in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date they satisfy the applicable waiting period and any other eligibility requirements for participation. Eligible Employees shall provide to the Pension Committee on an Applicable Form such participation enrollment information as shall be required by the Pension Committee, which shall include the Eligible Employee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Plan. Notwithstanding an Eligible Employee's failure to complete the Applicable Form, the Eligible Employee shall become a Participant as specified in the Adoption Agreement.
(c)
Optional Participation. The Employer may specify in the Adoption Agreement that participation is optional for certain classes of Eligible Employees, including Employees in the following categories: elected or appointed members of the Governing Authority, Municipal Legal Officers, City Manager, and Department Heads. If participation is optional for an Eligible Employee, then the Eligible Employee may elect to become a Participant at his option by filing with the Pension Committee, on an Applicable Form, such information as shall be required to enroll in the Plan, which shall include the Eligible Employee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Plan. The election to participate must be made within 120 days after the later of: the date the Eligible Employee commences employment with the Adopting Employer, the date the Eligible Employee is elected or appointed to office, or the date participation in the Plan is first permitted for members of a class to which he belongs. The election to participate shall be irrevocable, and the failure to make an election within the 120-day time limit specified above shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to participate in the Plan. If Employee contributions are required under the Adopting Employer's Plan, then Eligible Employees who apply for participation within the 120 day period may be required to make retroactive contributions in order to receive credit under the Plan for creditable Service prior the date they apply to participate in the Plan.
(d)
Participation in the Plan shall not give any Eligible Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Adopting Employer nor, upon dismissal, to have any right or interest in the Trust Fund other than as herein provided.
Section 4.04. - Change in Employment Status.
(a)
Transfer to Ineligible Status. Unless otherwise specified by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, if a Participant's employment status changes such that he becomes an Ineligible Employee, he shall cease to accrue benefits under the Plan for any purpose and his interest under the Plan, if any, shall be only such as existed immediately before he became an Ineligible Employee, unless and until he again becomes a Participant. In no event will his service or earnings as an Ineligible Employee be taken into account for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting, retirement eligibility, death benefit eligibility, or for purposes of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan. However, said period of service as an Ineligible Employee shall not be considered a break in Service under Section 4.06, provided the Ineligible Employee remains continuously employed by the Adopting Employer. If the Ineligible Employee does not again become a Participant prior to Retirement or Termination of Employment, his Vested Benefit, if any, shall be paid as provided in Article IX.
(b)
Transfer Back to Eligible Status. If an Ineligible Employee described in subsection (a) above remains continuously employed by the Adopting Employer and he has another change in employment status such that he again becomes a Participant, he shall thereafter be entitled to accrue benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan as in effect as of the date of the subsequent change in employment status. In no event, however, shall such a Participant receive a greater benefit under the Plan than that which the Participant would have received had the Participant not had a change in employment status.
Section 4.05. - Participant Leaves of Absence.
(a)
USERRA, FMLA Leave. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if any period of absence is required to be counted under USERRA, the FMLA or any other applicable federal or state law as Current Credited Service for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan, or for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting, retirement or death benefit eligibility, then said period of absence shall be counted as such in accordance with and subject to the requirements of such law.
(b)
Other Leaves of Absence. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, an authorized leave of absence granted to a Participant by the Adopting Employer will be counted as Current Credited Service for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan, and for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting and benefit eligibility. However, if the Participant does not return to active employment upon expiration of the authorized leave period, then subsection (c) shall apply.
(c)
Failure to Return to Service. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, if a Participant does not return to active employment with the Employer upon expiration of a leave of absence, his interest under the Plan, if any, including his Current Credited Service for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan, and for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting and any minimum service requirements for retirement or death benefit eligibility, will be limited to that accrued as of the date preceding the approved leave period.
(d)
Unused Leave. The Adopting Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to credit certain unused leave at termination or retirement as Credited Service, subject to the terms and limits specified in the Adoption Agreement.
Section 4.06. - Non-Vested Participant Breaks in Service.
Except as otherwise provided in the Adoption Agreement, this Section shall apply only to Participants who are Eligible Regular Employees. If a non-vested Participant experiences a break in Service, the Participant's Current Credited Service shall not include any Service rendered prior to the break in Service, unless the Participant returns to employment with the Adopting Employer and performs the lesser of: Service equal to the break in Service, or Service equal to one (1) year.
The following limitations shall apply in administering the break in Service rule:
(a)
Absence of Less Than One (1) Year. If a Participant terminates employment with the Adopting Employer and returns to employment with the Adopting Employer within one (1) year after said termination, the Participant shall not be deemed to have incurred a break in Service. Except as otherwise required under this Section, however, the time he was absent shall not be taken into account for any purpose under the Plan.
(b)
Interim Employment with Another GMEBS Employer. If a Participant terminates employment with the Adopting Employer and returns to employment with the Adopting Employer after having spent the interim period in the continuous employment of another Employer in the GMEBS, he shall not be deemed to have incurred a break in Service. The time he was absent may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the Participant has met the minimum Service requirements for vesting and retirement eligibility under the Adopting Employer's Plan, as provided by and subject to the provisions of Section 9.05 concerning portability. However, in no event shall the time he was absent from the Adopting Employer be taken into account for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Adopting Employer's Plan.
(c)
Treatment of Leaves of Absence. No leave of absence or other period of absence from employment shall be considered a break in Service if it is not permitted to be treated as such under USERRA, the FMLA, or any other applicable federal or state law. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, any other authorized leave of absence granted to a Participant shall not be deemed a break in Service, provided the Participant was regularly employed by the Employer immediately prior to his leave of absence and the Participant is reemployed by the Employer upon expiration of the leave of absence. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, if a Participant does not return to active employment upon expiration of the approved leave period, he will be considered to have incurred a break in Service under this Section as of the date immediately preceding the approved leave period.
(d)
Transfer to Ineligible Employee Status. Unless otherwise specified by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, if a Participant's employment status changes such that he becomes an Ineligible Employee pursuant to Section 4.04, the period of time spent as an Ineligible Employee shall not be considered a break in Service under this Section, provided the Participant remains employed by the Adopting Employer. Unless otherwise specified by the Adopting Employer, leaves of absence granted to an Ineligible Employee will not be considered a break in Service under this Section, provided the Ineligible Employee returns to active employment with the Employer upon expiration of the approved leave period and the requirements of subsection (c) are otherwise satisfied with respect to such leave of absence.
(e)
Graduated Vesting. If the Adopting Employer has established a graduated vesting schedule in the Adoption Agreement, then a break in Service shall not affect that percentage of the Retirement Benefit in which a Participant is Vested prior to the break.
(f)
Repeated Breaks in Service. If a non-vested Participant has a break in Service, returns to employment with the Adopting Employer, and experiences one or more additional breaks in Service prior to satisfying the one (1) year Service requirement necessary to work off the initial break, then the Participant's Current Credited Service shall not include any Service rendered prior to the most recent break in Service, unless upon the Participant's return to employment with the Employer following the most recent break in Service he performs Service for a period equal to one (1) year.
