ARTICLE 12. - C-1 HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL

Sec. 1201. - Purpose.
C-1 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve business areas that are motor vehicle oriented, rather than pedestrian oriented. C-1 districts provide areas that are convenient and attractive for retail activities, business transactions, and services to the public designed primarily to meet the day-to-day shopping and service needs not only of residents of Spalding County, but of surrounding communities as well. Off-street parking and minimum yards are required. These areas are more suburban in nature than of a "downtown" character.
Sec. 1202. - Boundaries of C-1 districts.
The official map (Section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all C-1 districts within Spalding County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
