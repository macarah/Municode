Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system by any person;
2.
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city's separate storm sewer system;
3.
Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city's separate storm sewer system; and
4.
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
B.
Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply throughout the municipal boundaries of the city and to all discharges entering the city's storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by an authorized enforcement agency.
C.
Compatibility with Other Regulations.
This chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of the ordinance codified in this chapter are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of the ordinance codified in this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
D.
Responsibility for Administration.
The authorized enforcement agency shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the authorized enforcement agency may be delegated in writing by the authorized enforcement agency to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employment of the agency.

(Ord. 04-106 ยง 2 (part), 2004)
8.26.040 - Reserved.
8.26.050 - Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES Stormwater Discharge Permit shall comply with the provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the authorized enforcement agency prior to allowing discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system.
(Ord. 04-106 ยง 2 (part), 2004)
8.26.060 - Access and inspection of properties and facilities.
A.
Applicability.
This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.
B.
Access to Facilities.
1.
The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities at reasonable times subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to a low access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
2.
Facility owners or operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, photographing, videotaping, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
3.
The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
4.
The authorized enforce agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary and make the monitoring data available to the authorized enforcement agency at the owner or operator's own expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
5.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator.
6.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose or conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
7.
If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
