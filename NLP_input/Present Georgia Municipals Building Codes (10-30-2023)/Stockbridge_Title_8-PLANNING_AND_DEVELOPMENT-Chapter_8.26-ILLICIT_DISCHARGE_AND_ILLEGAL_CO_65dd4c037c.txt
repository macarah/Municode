1.
Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system by any person;
2.
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city's separate storm sewer system;
3.
Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city's separate storm sewer system; and
4.
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
B.
Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply throughout the municipal boundaries of the city and to all discharges entering the city's storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by an authorized enforcement agency.
C.
Compatibility with Other Regulations.
This chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of the ordinance codified in this chapter are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of the ordinance codified in this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
D.
Responsibility for Administration.
The authorized enforcement agency shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the authorized enforcement agency may be delegated in writing by the authorized enforcement agency to persons or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employment of the agency.

Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test; and
4.
The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the state and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
B.
Prohibition of Illegal Connections.
The construction, connection, use, maintenance or continued existence of any illegal connection to the city's separate storm sewer system is prohibited.
1.
This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of the connection.
2.
A person violates this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the city's separate storm sewer system, or allows such a connection to continue.
3.
Improper connections in violation of this chapter must be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved onsite wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the sanitation department.
4.
Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the authorized enforcement agency requiring that such locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be completed, that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the authorized enforcement agency.
(Ord. 04-106 § 2 (part), 2004)
8.26.040 - Reserved.
8.26.050 - Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES Stormwater Discharge Permit shall comply with the provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form acceptable to the authorized enforcement agency prior to allowing discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system.
(Ord. 04-106 § 2 (part), 2004)
8.26.060 - Access and inspection of properties and facilities.
A.
Applicability.
This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.
B.
Access to Facilities.
1.
The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities at reasonable times subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to a low access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
2.
Facility owners or operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, photographing, videotaping, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
3.
The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
4.
The authorized enforce agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary and make the monitoring data available to the authorized enforcement agency at the owner or operator's own expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
5.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator.
6.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose or conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
7.
If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 04-106 § 2 (part), 2004)
8.26.070 - Notification of accidental discharges and spills.
A.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility, activity or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility, activity or operation has information of any known or suspected release of pollutants or non-stormwater discharges from that facility or operation which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the city's separate storm sewer system, state waters, or waters of the United States that person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release so as to minimize the effects of the discharge.
B.
The person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone, facsimile or in person no later than twenty-four (24) hours of the nature, quantity and time of occurrence of the discharge. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the authorized enforcement agency within three (3) business days of the phone call or in person notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. That person shall also take immediate steps to ensure no recurrence of the discharge or spill.
C.
In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, emergency response agencies and/or other appropriate agencies shall be immediately notified.
D.
Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 04-106 § 2 (part), 2004)
8.26.080 - Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices.
The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contaminations of stormwater, the storm drain system, state waters or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 04-106 § 2 (part), 2004)
8.26.090 - Watercourse protection.
