Should the county engineer disapprove the request to install or operate lighting fixtures within any public right-of-way because of the failure to meet standards, he/she shall communicate such disapproval in writing to the party requesting same. Such written communication shall include the specific reasons for disapproval. Any disapproval of a light or lighting system by the county engineer may be appealed to the board of commissioners.

(b)
Roadway or street lighting luminaries or fixtures installed within the public rights-of- way as "security lights," or for the purpose of lighting areas other than the public streets, shall be mounted on the side of the pole opposite from such street and shall be oriented in such a manner to insure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street, so as to protect the users of the street from objectionable glare. The approval of the county engineer shall be obtained before installation of such lights.
(c)
Other lighting fixtures to be installed within or outside or public rights-of-way for whatever purpose shall be installed and operated in such a manner as to prevent glare from being a hazard to or interfering with the normal use of the public rights-of-way.

(b)
Fixtures for illuminating areas adjoining the public streets, roads, etc., such as parking areas, driveways, etc., will be mounted in such a manner as to insure that the light pattern is kept off the public highway. When street or roadway lighting luminaries are to be used for "security lighting," they will be mounted on the side of the pole that is opposite from the public street and will be mounted to insure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street and the vertical light distribution at the initial light source is perpendicular to the street.
(c)
If lighting fixtures of a type other than those in the classification of street or roadway luminaries are to be used or if the proposed lighting is to be for other than drives, parking areas or other similar area lighting, the plans and specifications submitted shall be sufficiently detailed to clearly show that such a proposal is in compliance with these standards and will not cause a hazard to, or interfere with, the normal use of the public streets, roads or highways.
