Sec. 20-6. - Review standards.
new
A site plan shall be approved only upon a finding of compliance with the following standards:
A.
The site plan must comply with all standards of this article and all applicable requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable laws and regulations.
B.
The site must be designed in a manner that is harmonious, to the greatest extent possible, with the character of the surrounding area.
C.
The site must be designed so as to minimize hazards to adjacent property, and to reduce the negative effects of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes and glare to the maximum extent possible.
D.
Unless a more specific design standard is required by the city through a different ordinance, all uses and structures subject to site plan review shall comply with the following design standards:
1.
Traffic Circulation. The number, location, size of access and entry points, and internal vehicular and pedestrian circulation routes shall be designed to promote safe and efficient access to and from the site, and circulation within the site. In reviewing traffic features, the number, spacing, and alignment of existing and proposed access points shall be considered relative to their impact on traffic movement on abutting streets and adjacent properties.
2.
Stormwater. Stormwater detention and drainage systems shall be designed so that the removal of surface waters will not adversely affect neighboring properties or public stormwater drainage systems. Unless impractical, stormwater shall be removed from all roofs, canopies and paved areas by underground surface drainage system.
3.
Landscaping. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing unnecessary tree and soil removal, and any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas. Provision or preservation of landscaping, buffers or greenbelts may be required to ensure that the proposed uses will be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding property.
4.
Screening. Where non-residential uses abut residential uses, appropriate screening shall be provided, in accordance with Article 19, so as to shield residential properties from noise, headlights and glare.
5.
Lighting. Lighting shall be designed so as to minimize glare on adjacent properties and public streets. As a condition of site plan approval, reduction of lighting during non-business hours may be required.
6.
Utility Service. All utility service shall be underground, unless impractical.
7.
Exterior Uses. Exposed storage areas, machinery, heating and cooling units, service areas, loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas shall be located so as to have a minimum negative effect on adjacent properties, and shall be screened, if reasonably necessary, to ensure compatibility with surrounding properties.
8.
Emergency Access. All buildings and structures shall be readily accessible to emergency vehicles.
9.
Water and Sewer. Water and sewer installations shall comply with all city specifications and requirements.
10.
Signs. Permitted signs shall be located to avoid creating distractions and visual clutter.
11.
Building Design. New or substantially remodeled buildings shall be reasonably compatible in appearance with, or shall enhance, the established general character of other buildings in the immediate vicinity.
Sec. 20-7. - Conditions.
new
Conditions which are designed to ensure compliance with the intent of this ordinance and the Palmetto City Code may be imposed on site plan approval.
Sec. 20-8. - Changes to approved site plan.
new
Changes to an approved site plan shall be permitted only under the following circumstances:
A.
The holder of an approved site plan shall notify the zoning administrator of any proposed change to an approved site plan.
B.
Changes to a Level "A" site plan may be approved by the zoning administrator.
C.
Minor changes to a Level "B" site plan may be approved by the zoning administrator upon determining that the proposed revision(s) will not alter the basic design nor any specified conditions imposed as part of the original approval. Minor changes shall include the following:
1.
Reduction in building size or increase in building size up to five percent of total approved floor area.
2.
Movement of buildings or other structures by no more than ten feet.
3.
Replacement of plant material specified in the landscape plan with comparable materials of an equal or greater size.
4.
Changes in building materials to a comparable or higher quality.
5.
Changes in floor plans which do not alter the character of the use.
6.
Changes required or requested by the city or county, state, or federal regulatory agency in order to conform to other laws or regulations.
D.
A proposed change to a Level "B" site plan, not determined by the zoning administrator to be a minor change, shall be submitted to the planning and zoning board as a site plan amendment and shall be reviewed in the same manner as the original application.
Sec. 20-9. - Expiration.
new
Site plan approval shall expire 12 months after the date of approval, unless substantial construction has been commenced and is continuing. The zoning administrator, in the case of a Level "A" site plan, or the planning and zoning board, in the case of Level "B" site plan, may grant one extension of up to 12 additional months; provided the applicant requests, in writing, an extension prior to the date of expiration of the site plan. The extension shall be approved if the applicant presents reasonable evidence to the effect that the development has encountered unforeseen difficulties beyond the control of the applicant, and the project will proceed within the extension period. If the above provisions are not fulfilled or the extension has expired prior to construction, the site plan approval shall become null and void.
Sec. 20-10. - Appeal.
new
Any person having a special interest in a decision relating to the approval or denial of a site plan or the conditions imposed shall have the right to appeal the decision to the zoning board of appeals.
