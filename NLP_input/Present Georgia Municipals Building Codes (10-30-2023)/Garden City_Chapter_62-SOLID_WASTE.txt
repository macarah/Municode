Sec. 62-166. - Findings.
The mayor and council of Garden City, Georgia, hereby find that recycling will cause benefits by reducing demand on landfills and by conserving resources. Recycling will be encouraged and increased by having the city's waste management service equipment pick-up separated recyclable materials at residences utilizing roll-out carts for trash pick-up on a regular schedule. The mayor and council further find that, a survey of the residents having been taken and public hearings having been held, it appears that curbside pick-up of recyclable materials will be effective.
(Ord. No. 2009-9, § 1, 8-17-09)
Sec. 62-167. - Pick-up by city's waste management service of certain recyclable materials from residences utilizing roll-out carts for trash pick-up.
Effective September 1, 2009, the following recyclable materials shall be picked-up by the city's waste management service from residences utilizing roll-out carts for trash pick-up:

Paper (including newspaper, cardboard, magazines, and phone books).
The above-mentioned list is subject to change depending upon the increased or reduced capabilities of the city's waste management service provider. Persons desiring to take recyclables to pick-up locations operated by any public or private enterprise may do so, and thus bypass the city's curbside recycling program for some or all of their recycling needs.
