DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Secs. 22-235—22-261. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 22-262. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
This division provides the procedures and minimum requirements for a PUD conditional use approval to implement the goals of development and redevelopment, preserving the natural environment, encouraging high quality development through innovative design and ensuring adequate access to facilities and services.
(b)
It is intended that development in a PUD district be superior to that which would occur under conventional zoning regulations.
(c)
Developments occurring under this division should:
(1)
Have unique, flexible, creative and imaginative arrangements and mixes of land uses in site planning and development where the various land uses are complimentary to each other.
(2)
Develop tracts of land as single developments that promote self-contained communities including residential uses and civic, educational, recreational and/or other public and private facilities.
(3)
Preserve the natural amenities of the land through maintenance of conservation areas, open spaces and recreational facilities (i.e., baseball fields, soccer fields, gymnasium, etc.).
(4)
Provide for the more efficient use of land through clustering and other flexible, innovative development arrangements that will result in smaller networks of utilities and streets thereby lowering development costs and housing/commercial costs.
(5)
Provide for a more desirable living environment than would be possible through the strict application of conventional requirements.
(6)
Provide for slightly higher gross and net development densities and intensities as an inducement to develop in a manner consistent with the purposes of this article.
(7)
Ensure that the designs of building forms are interrelated and architecturally harmonious.
(Code 1991, § 22-185)
Sec. 22-263. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Development plan means a to-scale drawing of single and/or multifamily residential, institutional, office, commercial or industrial development, or some combination thereof, showing the general layout of a proposed development including, among other features, the location of buildings, parking areas, buffers and landscaping and open/recreational spaces. The development plan and related information form the basis for the approval or disapproval of the development of a PUD.
Planned unit development means a form of development characterized by a unified site design for a number of housing units, clustered buildings, common open/recreational spaces and a mix of building types and land uses.
(Code 1991, § 22-186)
Sec. 22-264. - Permitted locations and uses.
Planned unit developments shall be permitted in all zoning districts excluding R-1A. Any use may be permitted in a PUD if said use is shown on the development plan and referred to in the PUD application and approved in accordance with this division. The permitted uses of property located in a PUD shall be proposed by the applicant and approved at the time the PUD application is approved if the proposed uses are consistent with the comprehensive plan and meet the criteria for approval specified in this section. The planning and zoning commission, in recommending approval of any PUD, may designate the maximum height, floor area and/or other restrictions on the development of such uses.
(Code 1991, § 22-187)
Sec. 22-265. - Requirements.
(a)
Dimensional. A planned unit development may depart from strict conformance with the required dimensions, setbacks, area, height, bulk, use and specific content regulations of the city's land use regulations to the extent specified in the PUD application if approved, so long as the PUD provides tangible benefits in the form of provisions of open/recreational space, amenities, superior design, etc.
(1)
Said benefits must be identified in accordance with the community benefit statement as provided for in this division. Departure from any requirements specified in this division and other city regulations is a privilege and shall be granted only upon approval by the city council after review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission.
(2)
A PUD development plan shall not have to follow the regulations for the zoning district in which the development is located, unless otherwise provided in this section. There shall be no requirements for minimum lot size, minimum lot width, lot coverage, yards and building setbacks or height requirements that apply to a PUD unless said requirements are specified by planning and zoning or the city council at time of approval. Dimensional requirements shall be as proposed by the applicant and recommended for approval by the planning and zoning commission during the PUD application plan review process.
(b)
Minimum open space. A minimum of 20 percent of the total land area included within the PUD shall be open/recreational space, including active or passive recreation. This requirement can include open land which is otherwise unbuildable (i.e., floodplains and wetlands) so long as the applicant proposes appropriate improvements to these areas such as trails, ball fields, etc. Proposed PUDs within one-quarter-mile radius of an existing city park may calculate the existing park acreage in complying with this section so long as the applicant proposes direct pedestrian access to the park being utilized in complying with this section. In no case shall the level of service for the existing park fall below two acres per 1,000 persons within a one-quarter-mile circumference around park. This calculation shall be provided by the applicant at the time of the preapplication conference. Said pedestrian access shall comply with city standards for sidewalk construction. Where existing sidewalks provide access to and from the PUD, applicant shall review the city sidewalk inventory, a copy of which is on file in the planning department and propose improvements where the sidewalk inventory identifies "no sidewalk" or "needs improvement." Logical termini shall be proposed by the applicant in the PUD application and approved by the planning and zoning commission. Pedestrian scale streetlights shall be proposed by the applicant along the pedestrian corridor linking the PUD to the park. It is defined, unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning commission, that the pedestrian corridor extends through the PUD at its widest width and connecting to the park.
(c)
Density. The minimum allowable density for residential components of PUDs shall be six dwelling units per gross acre of land devoted to residential uses. Within any PUD, a minimum of 30 percent of the total development site (excluding non-developable lands such as wetlands and floodplains) shall be designated on the development plan as residential use.
(Code 1991, § 22-188)
Sec. 22-266. - General considerations for land use mix and design.
(a)
Comprehensive plan. Uses within the PUD shall be predominantly in accordance with the use recommendations and policies of the comprehensive plan.
(b)
Housing unit diversity. Where appropriate, the PUD should provide for more than just one type of dwelling unit, such as townhouses, duplexes and multifamily dwellings in addition to or in lieu of detached, single-family dwellings. Multifamily dwellings should comprise at least 20 percent, but no more than 60 percent of the total dwelling units within the PUD without explicit approval from the planning and zoning commission. In PUDs designed for post-secondary educational uses with limited quasi-public facilities, multifamily dwelling units are to be construed as dormitories and may comprise 100 percent of the dwelling units and shall be excluded from the housing affordability component prescribed in this division.
(1)
All PUDs shall contain a housing affordability component. A minimum of ten percent of the dwelling units shall be reserved for those whose household income is between 80 percent and 120 percent of the area median income as defined by the most recent U.S. Census or other approved source. The exterior of these dwelling units shall be composed of similar materials and design and shall be indiscernible from all other dwelling units within the PUD.
(2)
In areas where a PUD is proposed that contains existing housing, a housing survey must be completed prior to submittal of a formal application. The housing survey must include all existing structures within the area to be designated as a PUD. The housing survey should include property address and year of construction. For structures and dwelling units aged 50 years or more, photo documentation of all sides of the structure and/or dwelling unit shall be provided, bounded in a booklet titled, Proposed PUD—Historic Structures and Housing Survey. For each photo documented structure and dwelling unit, the chief building official shall provide an assessment identifying each structure and dwelling unit as standard, substandard, dilapidated or deteriorated as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Proposed PUD—Historic Structures and Housing Survey shall then be delivered to the applicant who shall conduct an assessment by a qualified person skilled in historic preservation and tasked in determining contributing and non-contributing structures and dwelling units. Those structures and dwelling units identified as contributing and standard or substandard shall be identified on the concept and development plan and shall be reserved for rehabilitation (existing lot sizes can be altered to reflect the typical lot size of the proposed development). It is the intent of this section to promote the preservation of the city's historic homes. However, should the cost of rehabilitating those structures and/or dwelling units, based on a submitted feasibility study, be determined to be cost prohibitive, a sign shall be posted in a conspicuous location on-site, visible from the public rights of way, for a minimum of 30 days stating the following: "This home is a contributing structure/dwelling unit within a proposed PUD. Rehabilitation of this structure has been determined to be cost prohibitive based on a feasibility study. The feasibility study is on file in the planning department of the city. This structure/dwelling unit is slated for demolition or removal unless written notice is provided to the city planning department indicating your intention to purchase and rehabilitate according to the standards prescribed for this PUD or your intention to purchase and remove this structure/dwelling unit from this site within 30 days of submission of your written inquiry." For structures within a historic district, treatment of those structures shall be in accordance with the existing city historic preservation ordinance.
(c)
Civic, educational and institutional uses. PUDs shall contain sites for residential uses and, at a minimum, at least one of the following: church, educational facility, community or club buildings and/or similar public or quasi-public facilities.
(d)
Retail component. Retail trade establishments and personal service establishments shall be located in careful relation to other land uses within and outside of the proposed development. Such uses need to be scaled and designed to/for the pedestrian and to the PUD itself. Appropriate hardscape and landscape elements shall be proposed which complement and enhance the relationship between the residential and nonresidential uses within and outside but adjacent to the PUD. The amount of land in a PUD devoted to retail trade and personal service establishments shall be a minimum of five percent but not exceed 30 percent of the total site area of the development. In PUDs devoted primarily to educational uses, the retail component may include concession stands, laundry facilities, vending areas and other retail uses such as a student bookstore, student cafeteria or private or public day care center or other use proposed by applicant that could reasonably be considered a retail or personal service establishment.
(e)
Industrial uses. Industrial uses are not typically considered to be appropriate for inclusion within PUDs; however, such uses are not prohibited and may be considered appropriate and desirable uses in PUDs consisting of 20 acres or more where living and working areas need to be proximate to one another, subject to separation and landscape/screening requirements to ensure that landscape and hardscape elements complement and enhance the relationship between the residential and nonresidential uses.
(f)
Interconnectivity. All new streets within the proposed PUD shall contain travel lanes of no more than 12 feet for one-way traffic and no more than 24 feet for two-way traffic. All streets, existing or proposed, shall include curb and gutter, a minimum of two feet wide grass strip between the curb and sidewalk and a minimum of a four-foot-wide sidewalk. Crosswalks shall be appropriately defined. Painted crosswalk sections do not constitute appropriately defined crosswalks. Streetscape elements such as street trees, pedestrian oriented lighting and decorative traffic signs (including street names) shall be provided for all streets within the PUD. Traffic signs including, street names, yield and stop signs should be located on a shared, decorative pole. While pedestrian-oriented lighting is encouraged along all pedestrian facilities, at a minimum, decorative street lighting is required at all street intersections or along the entire street/pedestrian section. It is preferable that street lighting be solar powered. It is preferable that traffic signs be co-located on decorative, pedestrian-oriented light poles on all corners of the intersection. Renderings of typical traffic signs, crosswalk sections and street lighting shall be provided with the concept and development plan submitted for approval. A typical street section detail shall be provided with the concept and development plan submitted for approval.
(g)
Landscape elements. A landscape plan shall be proposed and submitted for approval prior to issuance of a building permit. At the time of the PUD application, the applicant must provide a written statement identifying the general guidelines for landscape installation for each type of use proposed in the PUD (residential, commercial, retail, etc.) and provide a general rendering of the proposed landscape for each type of use (residential, commercial, retail, etc.). The general rendering provides for a visual representation of what the written statement would provide for. The written statement should identify the general dimensions of proposed buffers and landscape requirements for all land uses. The general rendering shall graphically illustrate the dimensional requirements and landscape elements identified in the written statement. The landscape plan submitted prior to the issuance of a building permit shall be in substantial compliance with the written statement and general renderings depicting the proposed landscape at the time of the PUD approval. Native species and non-invasive plants are permissible. Where feasible, existing trees shall be preserved. It is the intent of this section to promote the use of native species and reduce water usage for landscaped elements. Non-native species shall be watered by an automated watering system. All watering systems shall be required to have a rain sensor. The use of invasive plants is prohibited.
(h)
Signs. Typical sign plans and/or sign standards showing maximum widths and heights and construction materials shall be proposed by developer and approved inclusive with the PUD approval. A written statement identifying the sign dimension and construction materials shall be provided and rendering graphically illustrating the written statement shall be provided at the time of PUD approval. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, detailed construction drawings shall be provided and said drawings shall be in substantial compliance with the written statement and rendering provided at the time of the PUD approval.

(a)
The purpose of the TND district is to create an innovative residential zoning classification that encourages a pattern of neighborhood development that will be consistent with the traditional qualities of the city historic districts and that will be compatible with surrounding residential areas of the city. The TND district is distinguished from other residential zoning districts through a unified plan for a neighborhood that includes a diversity of land uses and lot sizes, housing types and sizes to accommodate persons of a variety of stages of life in a pedestrian-oriented setting that is well integrated with city neighborhoods, parks, civic spaces, and commercial uses. The TND district results in fewer burdens on present and projected public services and utilities than would result from conventional subdivision development.
(b)
The TND design guidelines are hereby adopted and shall apply to property in the TND. A copy of the TND Guidelines shall be kept on file in the administrative offices of the city planning department. Within the TND district, design and construction of new buildings that are not in substantial conformity with the TND design guidelines is prohibited.
