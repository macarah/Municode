ARTICLE 14. - O-1 OFFICE RESIDENTIAL[4]

Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Cross reference— Businesses, ch. 26.

Section 1401. - Purpose.
O-1 zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve districts for lower density office activities, with a mix of certain compatible residential activities also permitted. In many cases this district may be appropriate to provide a transition from residential uses where it is elected not to use a buffer (see definition in article 2) for such purposes and where adequate space exists for such a transition area. O-1 development standards require adequate yard space and off-street parking and service facilities. Permitted uses are restricted and protected from encroachment by uses capable of adversely affecting the limited character of the district.
Section 1402. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an O-1 district.
The factors contained in section 410 of this ordinance must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the board of commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Upson County.
Section 1403. - Boundaries of O-1 districts.
The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all O-1 districts within Upson County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
