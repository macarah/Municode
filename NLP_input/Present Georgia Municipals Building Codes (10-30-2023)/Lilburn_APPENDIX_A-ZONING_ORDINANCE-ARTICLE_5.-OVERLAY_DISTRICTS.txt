Section 502. - Town Center (TC) Overlay District.
502-1 Purpose and intent. The Town Center Overlay District provides a template for establishing a mixed-use, main street character. The historic features of the Town Center Overlay District provide Main Street and Old Town with unique opportunities for mixed-use development projects that will give character to the streetscape, relate to the surrounding area through character and design, are close to local services and facilities, are oriented to encourage community interaction, foster the use of pedestrian and bicycle transportation, and include commercial land uses that are intended to serve the needs of local residents.
The Town Center Overlay District is not a zoning district. It is an area that has been identified to provide new residential and commercial opportunities through redevelopment and infill development. Within the Town Center Overlay District, the uses permitted by the underlying zoning district are allowed unless expressly prohibited.
The Town Center Overlay District shall provide an opportunity for development of residential, commercial, and mixed use projects. These regulations are intended to provide flexibility in design; encourage a mixture of uses; promote opportunities to live and work in the same space; and to encourage multiple uses in one building or development.
502-2 Boundaries and map. The Town Center Overlay District standards shall apply to all property within the district boundary as shown on the Official Zoning Map of Lilburn which is hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance, and which may be amended from time to time in accordance with the procedures established in this zoning ordinance.
This article shall not apply to applications for building permits for accessory structures 400 square feet or less in area. This article shall not apply to a remodel of an existing dwelling or a permit proposal which would increase the existing ground floor area of a dwelling by less than 25%.
502-3 Permitted uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Article 6, "Use and Supplemental Conditions Tables." In cases where a use is permitted but there are specific use regulations for that use specified in Article 7, such regulations shall also apply and must be complied with.
Encouraged are buildings in this district that are a mix of uses including commercial, office, and residential uses. Mixed-use buildings may include retail service or office uses on the bottom floor, with upper floors used for office or residential uses.
502-4 Architecture and building materials.
1.
The modification of existing buildings shall conform to the existing historic and landmark architecture of Lilburn. New development should preserve and maintain the scale and character of the area with architectural forms compatible with the buildings in the surrounding area.
2.
The style and building materials used in new or renovated buildings should echo the character of commercial and residential structures developed in the area near the turn of the 20th century: 1880s through 1920s.
3.
All exterior wall materials of dwellings within infill residential development projects shall consist of brick, stone, masonry, wood clapboards, fiber cement siding, or weather boarding, and appropriate architectural accents as approved by the director as a part of site design and architectural review. Standing-seam or corrugated metal walls or vinyl siding shall not be permitted on any façade or building wall. Architectural treatments shall occur on all four sides of the building. Roof materials shall be asphalt composition, wood shake, tile, or standing seam metal, in a city approved palette color.
502-5 Additional design criteria for approval. The following design criteria will be considered by the department in the review of applications for development projects within the Town Center Overlay District:
1.
Connectivity. Infill should achieve connectivity between on-site and off-site transportation systems, streetscapes, and open space networks. Sidewalks need to be provided which connect to the existing or planned adjacent sidewalk system, and streets need to connect to the adjacent existing or planned street pattern.
2.
Circulation. If the infill development is large enough, new street systems should be laid out as an interconnected network and designed to meet the needs of bicyclists, strollers, wheelchairs, pedestrians, and motor vehicles.
3.
Alley garages. Garages accessed by alleys can enhance the design and function of infill projects and therefore should be considered and implemented as appropriate.
502-6 Site design and building orientation. To assure that development and redevelopment within the Town Center District is consistent with the goals of this article, in addition to development regulations provided by City Code, the following is required prior to the issuance of development and building permits by the city.
1.
Building plan submission including the following information:
a.

b.
No product advertisement is allowed on the piece.
c.
No expressions of profanity or expressions that would be offensive to the general public or violate state laws on obscenity.
