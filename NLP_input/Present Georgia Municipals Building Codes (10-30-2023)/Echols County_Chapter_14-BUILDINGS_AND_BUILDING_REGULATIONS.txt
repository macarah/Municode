The county shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means.
(13)
Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna.
(14)
Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as follows:
a.
The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact.
b.
Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or special use permit to include a response into the application when filed.
1.
Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant to the current application if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, owners of other such existing or proposed towers to which this article applies shall be required to respond and failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this article and shall void all current and future applications from the tower owner so failing to respond until satisfactory remedy has been made.
2.
The county shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner.
3.
Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on that owner's tower as described in subsection (14)c of this section, that owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.
c.
The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted:
1.
Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses, and tower height.
2.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring that structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna.
3.
Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the responding owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required.
4.
If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all technically possible.
5.
If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use.
d.
Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The county may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. The county may engage the services of an independent radio frequency engineer or other qualified individual or firm for the purpose of reviewing, evaluating and verifying the radio frequency propagation maps and other information submitted by the applicant. The cost of such services shall be added to the application fees otherwise provided for by this article and other applicable code sections and shall be paid by the applicant.
(15)
Any other information which may be requested by the county to fully evaluate and review the application and potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna.

If such tower or antenna is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the county may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or antenna to be removed. If such tower or antenna is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the county may remove such tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that communications towers and antennas not in compliance with this Code and county ordinances or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The county may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
Sec. 14-159. - Abandoned towers.
(a)
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the county notifying the owner of such abandonment, the county may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned communications towers and antennas are removed. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may seek to have the communications tower or antenna removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 14-181. - Scope.
The requirements set forth in this division shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article, including alternative tower structures.
Sec. 14-182. - Building codes, safety standards.
To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Such inspection shall be conducted periodically and at least once every three years. Inspection shall be conducted by a trained and certified tower inspector and reviewed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the state. The tower inspector shall be either a state-licensed engineer or a person whose business includes the erections and/or inspections of communication towers. The results of such inspections shall be provided to the board of commissioners or its designee. If, upon inspection, the board of commissioners or its designee concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, then, upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, such party shall have 30 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the deficiency constitutes an immediate danger to persons or property, then the tower owner shall immediately correct such deficiencies with or without notice from the county. If the owner, permittee or lessee fails to bring the tower into compliance within the 30-day period, the board of commissioners may remove the tower at the owner's, permittee's or lessee's expense. Prior to the removal of any tower, the board of commissioners or its designee may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repairs of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the compliance period referenced in this section if no immediate danger exists.
Sec. 14-183. - Regulatory compliance.
(a)
All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennas.

(b)
Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communications tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
Sec. 14-184. - Security.
Communications towers shall be enclosed by decay resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device; provided, however, the county may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures.
Sec. 14-185. - Lighting.
No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, the FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the county may review lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
Sec. 14-186. - Advertising.
No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower.
Sec. 14-187. - Visual impact.
(a)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(b)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(c)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(d)
To the extent possible, towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design.
(e)
Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antennas, and shall be freestanding unlighted monopole structures where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower, self-supported lattice tower or taller structure requiring lighting under FAA regulations.
Sec. 14-188. - Landscaping.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows:
(1)
For towers 150 feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than ten feet wide shall commence at the property line.
(2)
For towers more than 150 feet tall, a buffer area of not less than 20 feet wide shall be provided at the property line.
(3)
The buffer zone is to consist of evergreen plant materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous buffer at least 15 feet in height within five years of planting and a mature height of at least 25 to 30 feet or more. Recommended species include, but are not necessarily limited to, Foster Holly, N.R. Stevens' Holly, Carolina Cherry Laurel, Deodar Cedar, Leyland Cypress, Southern Magnolia. A mix of several species is encouraged over monoculture plants for visual quality and disease resistance. Buffer planting designs are subject to review and approval by the county.
(4)
Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance.
(5)
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that vegetation loss.
(6)
In lieu of the standards of this section, the county may, at its sole discretion, allow use of any alternative detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening, including plants, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions of this section, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the county.
Sec. 14-189. - Maintenance impacts.
Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street unless approved otherwise for safety reasons.
Sec. 14-190. - Principal, accessory and joint uses.
(a)
Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made.
(b)
Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. Unless approved otherwise, the minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet and for a guy tower, the greater of 100 percent of tower breakpoint or 25 feet. This separation is required to ensure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site.
(c)
Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. The board of commissioners or its designee may grant an exception to the foregoing prohibition if the following conditions are met or exist:
(1)
Farm use where the storage of such fuels or chemicals is solely for the purpose of on-site farm activities and is directly related to an ongoing bona fide farming operation for which the owner files a "Schedule F" with the related federal income tax return.
(2)
Nonfarm uses which meet all of the following conditions:
a.
At least one-hour fire resistant interior surfaces are used in the construction of all buildings.
b.
Fire extinguishers are on the property.
c.
Telecommunication facilities are not designed and operated in such a manner so as to minimize the risk of igniting a wildfire or intensifying one that otherwise occurs.
d.
Graveled areas at least ten feet wide shall be installed completely around all new structures including the telecommunication towers. Fuels are kept in substantial compliance of the rules and regulations of the state safety fire commissioner and the state environmental protection division (EPD).
e.
All tree trimmings and trash generated by construction of the facility shall be removed from the property and properly disposed of prior to building permit finalization or commencement of operation, whichever occurs first.
f.
Demonstration of compliance with requirements of this article shall be signed off by a certified fire/safety inspector or engineer in the state on the building plans submitted.
Sec. 14-191. - Tower lot size, setbacks and separations.
(a)
The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to:
(1)
Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as specified in this division;
(2)
Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property;
(3)
Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 14-156.
(b)
A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it:
(1)
Meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this section;
(2)
Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street; and
(3)
Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street.
(c)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(d)
For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with subsection (b) of this section. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties.
(e)
All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the county may, but shall not be required to, waive or reduce setback requirements by up to 50 percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site.
(f)
When not located on the same lot, no freestanding communications tower shall be allowed within a 1,000-foot radius of an existing tower within a residential district.
(g)
When not located on the same lot, all freestanding towers shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements:
EXPAND
Tower Height
(feet) Separation
(feet)
;lt;50 300
50—100 500
101—150 750
150 + 1,000
  Towers and antennas mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures may be exempted from these minimum separation distances if so approved by the county.
