ARTICLE XVI. - CAPITAL ASSETS

Sec. 2-433. - Criteria.
A capital asset is defined as a financial resource meeting all of the following criteria:
(1)
It is tangible in nature.
(2)
It has a useful life of greater than three years.
(3)
It is not a repair part or supply item.
(4)
It has a value equal to, or greater than, the capitalization threshold of $5,000.00.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-1)
Sec. 2-434. - Valuation.
All assets shall be valued at original or historic cost. If the historic cost is not available the county may use either standard costing of a like unit at the estimated date of acquisition or back trending to arrive at an estimated cost based on the use of current cost factored by the price index since acquisition. Contributed capital assets shall be valued at fair market value. The county is a phase three government under GASBS 34 and will not be required to value or retroactively report existing infrastructure. All new infrastructures, as defined by GASBS 34, will be reported.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-2)
Sec. 2-435. - Recording.
All capital assets that meet the capitalization threshold of $5,000.00 shall be recorded and maintained in the general fixed asset account group.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-3)
Sec. 2-436. - Depreciation method.
The county shall use the straight-line method of depreciating capitalized assets. The county will depreciate infrastructure and not implement the modified approach for infrastructure. Useful life will be determined following best current practices. Fully depreciated assets that remain in use shall remain in the GFAAG.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-4)
Sec. 2-437. - General policy.
(a)
Proper documentation. Each department head is ultimately responsible for the proper recording, acquisition, transfer, and disposal of all assets within their department. County property may not be acquired, transferred, or disposed of without first providing proper documentation.
(b)
Recording of capital assets. Unless otherwise approved by the county administrator, all capital assets must be recorded within 30 calendar days after receipt and acceptance of the asset. An inventory control tag must be applied to all capital assets. An inventory tag shall be applied to all inventory items with an initial cost of over $500.00.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-5)
Sec. 2-438. - Acquisition.
(a)
Methods. There are various methods by which assets can be acquired. The asset acquisition method determines the basis for valuing the asset. Capital assets may be acquired in the following ways:
(1)
New purchases;
(2)
Donations;
(3)
Transfers from other county departments;
(4)
County surplus;
(5)
Internal/external construction;
(6)
Lease purchases;
(7)
Trade-in; or
(8)
Forfeiture or condemnation.
(b)
Purchased assets. Purchased assets will be capitalized at acquisition cost, including expenses incurred in preparing the asset for use.
(c)
Donated assets. Donated assets shall be recorded at fair market value as determined by the department head. Fair market value may be defined as, but is not limited to, an average of documented prices for equivalent items from three separate vendors.
(d)
Individual unit prices. The county will recognize acquisition costs based on individual unit prices. Assets should not be grouped.
(e)
Passing of title. For equipment purchases, title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received. Similarly, for donated assets, title is considered to pass when the asset is available for the agency's use and when the agency assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset.
(f)
Transfer upon operational status. Constructed assets are transferred from the construction in progress account to the related building, improvements other than buildings, or equipment accounts when they become operational. Constructed buildings, for example, are assumed to be operational when an authorization to occupy the building is issued, regardless of whether or not final payments have been made on all the construction contracts.
(g)
Lease purchases. Assets may be lease-purchased through installment purchases or through lease financing arrangements. All lease purchases are subject to annual appropriation and must be renewed annually. Title cannot transfer to the county until obligation is settled.
(h)
Transfer of capital assets. An asset transfer between departments is recorded under the new department with original acquired date and funding amount.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-5)
Sec. 2-439. - Disposal of capital assets.
(a)
Sale of capital assets by the county must be to the highest, responsible bidder and must be conducted by sealed bid or by auction. The sale must be publicized in accordance with state laws.
(b)
When an asset is disposed of, its value is removed from the financial balances reported and from inventory reports; however, the asset record, including disposal information, remains on the master file for three years, in the county administrator's office, after which time it is purged from the system according to general accepted accounting principles. This preserves an audit trail for disposed items, and facilitates departmental comparisons between actual or historical useful life information with useful life guidelines.
(c)
A disposal action is appropriate only when certain conditions occur resulting in an asset no longer being in the possession of the agency. Assets, no longer in use, that remain in the possession of the department, are considered surplus property and not a disposal.
(d)
Capital assets may be disposed of in any one of six ways:
(1)
Sale or trade-in;
(2)
Transfer;
(3)
Abandonment/retirement. Assets are abandoned or retired when there is no longer any use for them in the department, they are of no safe or appropriate use to any other county department and they cannot be repaired, transferred, cannibalized, sold, or traded in;
(4)
Lost or stolen. Stolen items must be reported to the county sheriff and a report filed. A copy of this report must accompany the disposal record.
(5)
Casualty loss. Casualty losses must be documented within 24 hours of loss and reported to the county administrator immediately for follow-up with the county's insurance carrier; and
(6)
Cannibalization. Cannibalization is the taking of parts and employing them for like uses within the department, such as is often the practice in computer or vehicle maintenance. Cannibalized items are considered surplus and are disposed of by noting cannibalization on the disposal record. Departments will send documentation of items cannibalized to the county administrator's office, and all remaining costs and accumulated depreciation will be removed from appropriate asset accounts in the general capital asset fund.
(e)
All assets no longer in the possession of the department, due to one of these six qualifying conditions and after submission of all appropriate documentation to the county administrator's office, will be removed from the master departmental asset file and considered disposed.
(f)
Department management is responsible for reviewing disposal reports, evaluating causes and trends leading to disposals, and implementing procedures to more effectively manage and control disposals when the dispositions represent problems, inefficiencies, and/or the incurrence of unnecessary cost.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-5)
Sec. 2-440. - Physical inventory.
An annual physical inventory of all capital assets will be performed by the county administrator's office. The inventory will be conducted with the least amount of interruption possible to the department's daily operation. A full report of the results of the inventory will be sent, within 30 days of completion, to all departments for verification and acceptance.
(Code 2002, § 1-6-6)
Secs. 2-441—2-463. - Reserved.
