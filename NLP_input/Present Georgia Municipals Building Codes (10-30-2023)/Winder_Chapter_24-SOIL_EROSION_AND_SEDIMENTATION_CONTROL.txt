Sec. 24-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
modified
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 24-4(b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsection 24-4(b) and (c) shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. section 12-7-6 subsection (b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 24-4(b)(2);
(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. section 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 24-4(b) and (c) of this article.
(e)
The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. (W-7-10) of 6-8-10; Ord. (W-2-23) of 1-3-23, §§ IV, V)
Sec. 24-5. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Winder without first obtaining a permit from the building inspector or his/her designee to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building inspector or his/her designee and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 24-5(c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 24-4(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two (2) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
(3)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. section 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority.

ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER RUNOFF

Sec. 24-50. - Title.
This article shall be cited as the "City of Winder Stormwater Detention Ordinance."
(Ord. (W-12-93) of 10-5-93)
Sec. 24-51. - Purpose.
This article is adopted for the purpose of:
(1)
Minimizing increases in the peak flow rates of stormwater runoff caused by urban development of watersheds within the city.
(2)
Establishing procedures through which the purpose can be fulfilled.
(3)
To protect water quality and provide protection for stream channels.
(Ord. (W-12-93) of 10-5-93; Ord. (W-30-07) of 11-13-07)
Sec. 24-52. - Scope and exclusions.
(a)
In accordance with provisions stated herein, a stormwater drainage and detention plan shall be submitted to the city. The plan shall consist of hydrologic and hydraulic computations as well as a drainage area map with supporting details. This article shall apply to any road construction, commercial, industrial, recreational, institutional, or residential development; however, the following are exempt from this requirement:
(1)
Residential development involving less than five (5) units or less than five (5) lots;
(2)
Projects undertaken by any federal, state county, or municipal government, governmental authority, or public utility.
(3)
Any proposed development which will result in an increase in runoff for a ten-year frequency storm of less than one (1) cfs. Hydrologic and hydraulic computations to support such a conclusion must be submitted to the city justifying this exemption.
All residential developments subject to this chapter shall provide for open space in the development in accordance with the City of Winder Subdivision regulations or the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, all commercial and industrial developments shall provide open space in the amount of five (5) per cent (minimum) of the area of the total development. Open space shall be defined as an area of land or water that is permanently set aside through dedication, reservation or designation. Open space may be reserved and used for preservation, required buffers, landscaping, leisure use, and stormwater management purposes but should not contain impervious surfaces, buildings or large structures. Open space does not include public rights-of-ways. The provisions of this section and any exceptions thereto, shall be interpreted, administered and applied by the City of Winder Planning Department, unless these duties are otherwise assigned by the Winder City Council.
(b)
Easements required. Any stormwater pipe or drainage facility that is designed to serve more than one (1) property or that is to be connected to the city stormwater system, shall be approved by the city before it is installed and shall be dedicated to the city by easement upon the completion of installation.
(Ord. (W-12-93) of 10-5-93; Ord. (W-30-07) of 11-30-07; Ord. (W-2-15) of 4-7-15, § E)
Sec. 24-53. - Hydrologic and hydraulic computations.
(a)
All hydrologic and hydraulic computations utilized in the design of stormwater detention facilities must be prepared by a registered engineer proficient in the field of hydrology and hydraulics and licensed in the State of Georgia.
(b)
The required hydrologic and hydraulic computations shall be in accordance with the procedures outlined in the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No. 55 entitled "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds", and all subsequent revisions thereto. Other computational procedures may be employed if approved by the city building inspector.
(Ord. (W-12-93) of 10-5-93)
Sec. 24-54. - Standards for stormwater detention.
(a)
The calculated peak rate of stormwater runoff resulting from a ten-year return frequency twenty-four-hour-duration flood shall be no greater after development of the site than that which would result from a ten-year return frequency twenty-four-hour-duration flood on the same site prior to development of the site.
(b)
Adequate attention must be given to safety and sanitation in the design of any detention facility. Sufficient information shall be shown on the plat to provide for proper construction of the facility. Sufficient design information to show that the facility will operate as required will be provided to the city building inspector for review. This shall include the existing or before-development peak discharge, the after-development peak discharge, and volume of runoff based on the proposed development, as well as all necessary computations used to determine the reduced peak flow. The capacity of the facility shall be sufficient to control the volume of stormwater runoff resulting from a ten-year frequency twenty-four-hour-duration flood within the peak rate of flow requirements stated above. The maintenance of the stormwater detention facilities will be the responsibility of the developer or home association if such organization is created.
(c)
Adequate erosion and sediment control measures shall be employed during the developments construction phase to ensure that the storm drainage and detention facilities perform as designed.
(d)
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(1)
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the most recent edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
(2)
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the most recent addition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and in accordance to the retrofit guidelines; and
(3)
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City of Winder are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(e)
Stream channel protection. For the purposes of this chapter, "channel" means a natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches:
(1)
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
(2)
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event;
This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city engineer for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity.
(3)
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(f)
Overbank flooding protection.
Overbank flood protection means measures taken to prevent an increase in the frequency and magnitude of out-of-bank flooding (i.e. flow events that exceed the capacity of the channel and enter the floodplain), and that are intended to protect downstream properties from flooding for the two-year through twenty-five-year frequency storm events.
Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under section 4.2 is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided.
This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city engineer for sites where a post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.

(a)
Administration. The provisions of this article shall be administered by the city engineer, or by any other person or company designated by the city council.
(b)
Bond provision. The city building inspector shall have the authority to require a performance bond equal in amount of the work to be performed to ensure proper construction of the storm drainage and detention facilities in accordance with the approved plan.
(c)
Permits. The stormwater drainage and detention plan submittal shall be accompanied by a thirty-dollar review fee unless such plan is included as part of a subdivision plat review, in which case the fee shall be waived. No grading or building permits shall be issued until the plan as outlined herein is approved by the city building inspector or his designated representative. All final plats for residential development subject to this chapter shall include the name of any and all parties responsible for the maintenance of any stormwater detention ponds, stormwater systems, or the like, as well as any appurtenances relating thereto.
(d)
Inspection and right-of-entry. The city building inspector or his designated representatives may enter during all reasonable hours any property under proposed or existing development and construction. The employees may make inspections of the storm drainage and detention facilities for the purpose of determining plan requirements or compliance with ordinance provisions.
(e)
Notice of violation. Whenever the city building inspector determines that activity on a property does not comply with the approved storm drainage and detention facilities construction plans, he may issue a notice of violation. The notice of violation of the provisions of this article or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be to the owner of the property or his agent and shall:
(1)
Be in writing;
(2)
Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where said violation has occurred;
(3)
List the specific requirements of the approved plan which have been violated.
(f)
Appeals. Appeals from decisions of the city building inspector relative to this article shall be made to the city council. Such appeal shall be filed with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of the written decision of the city building inspector.
(g)
Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this article shall be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day a violation continues.

ARTICLE V. - MULBERRY RIVER WATERSHED PROTECTION

Sec. 24-56. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicant, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the following watershed, which occur within the jurisdiction of the city and are herein identified as water supply watershed Mulberry River.

ARTICLE VI. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 24-71. - Purpose.
The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.
The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
For the purposes of this article, the term "city engineer" shall mean the person or firm designated as the city engineer of the City of Winder, or in the absence of a city engineer, any other person(s) or company designated by the Winder City Council.

Sec. 24-72. - Definitions.
The following words and terms are defined for use in this article. Where other terms or words require definition, please refer to the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Manual or call the District Corps office in Savannah, at 1-800-448-2402.
Functions: The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habit for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities.
Generalized wetland map: Wetlands identified on the U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Maps.
Hydric soils: Soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service.
Hydrophytic vegetation: Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional determination: An official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the state department of natural resources.
Jurisdictional wetland: A wetland area that meets the defined requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Regulated activity: Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 24-75 of this article and exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Silviculture: The art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees.
Temporary emergency permit: A temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 24-76.
Wetland: An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Wetland delineation: The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps.
Wetland protection district: Wetlands within the city, which are indicated on the generalized wetland map. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements.
The source wetlands map is the Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps. The city should consider the limitations of available map resources used to compile the generalized wetland map. To varying degrees, all maps contain systematic distortion and inaccuracy. Generally, inaccuracy grows larger with decreasing map scale. Commonly used wetland maps, such as the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) Maps, are drawn at a scale of 1:24,000. This means that one (1) inch on the map represents twenty-four thousand (24,000) inches on the ground, or two thousand (2,000) feet (approximately two-fifths (⅖) of a mile). Maps of this scale cannot define wetland boundaries in a legally defensible way. In addition, many small and isolated wetlands may not be shown on these maps. For these reasons, the generalized wetland map adopted by the city can only be regarded as a general reference document, which may serve a variety of functions, such as indicating the need for seeking advice or a wetland determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A generalized wetland map, at a scale of 1:24,000, cannot be used to delineate, in a legally defensible manner, the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands. Formal delineation of wetlands that are protected by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, is vested with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is the lead agency for making wetland delineations on agricultural lands.

Sec. 24-73. - Relationship to zoning.
The wetland protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements the city zoning map.
(Ord. (W-3-99) of 3-25-99)
Sec. 24-74. - Local development permit requirements.
No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city engineering department in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in section 24-75 or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within fifty (50) feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.
(Ord. (W-3-99) of 3-25-99)
Sec. 24-75. - Permitted uses.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
The activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.
Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required performance standards and fifteen (15) specific road construction best management practices (BMPs) that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.
Under section 404, normal on-going agricultural activities are exempted from 404 regulations and do not require a permit. Normal agricultural activities include planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock.
Under provisions of the Food Securities Act of 1985 (the so-called "swampbuster provisions") eligibility for all U.S. Department of Agriculture programs is denied to farms that convert wetlands to croplands. These programs include USDA price and income supports, disaster payments, crop insurance, Farmers Home Administration loans, Commodity Credit Corporation storage payments, farm storage facility loans, Conservation Reserve Program payments, and other programs under which payments are made to the farmer with respect to commodities produced.

ARTICLE VII. - SMALL WATERSHED PROTECTION FOR BARBER'S CREEK, CEDAR CREEK, FORT YARGO LAKE AND LAUREL LANE RESERVOIR

Sec. 24-100. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicant, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the following watersheds that are located within the jurisdiction of the city and are herein identified as water supply watershed: Barber's Creek, Cedar Creek, Fort Yargo Lake and Laurel Lane Reservoir.

Editor's note— Ord. W-3-18 , adopted July 24, 2018, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 24-201—24-214. To maintain the style of the Code, and at the editor's discretion, they have instead been set out as §§ 24-221—24-234.

Sec. 24-221. - Definitions.
modified
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Customers means all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the stormwater utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the city stormwater management programs and facilities and regulation of other public and private stormwater management programs, facilities and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities that will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the city stormwater management programs.
Developed land means any parcel or lot that has more than fifty (50) square feet of impervious surface located thereon.
Fiscal year means July 1 of a calendar year to June 30 of the next calendar year.
Hard structures include, but are not limited to, flumes, catch basins, drop inlets, outlet control structures, head walls, junction boxes, culverts, or curb and gutter used to convey stormwater.
Impervious area means the area, usually expressed in square feet, that is covered by an impervious surface.
Impervious surface means areas that prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it had entered in natural conditions prior to the development. Impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.
Stormwater coordinator means the utilities director in the event that the position is not occupied.
Stormwater credit manual means a document prepared by the Winder Stormwater Utility either by staff and/or consultants that provides procedures related to obtaining credits applicable towards the stormwater service fee.
Stormwater management programs means those systems, as further described herein, which address the issues of stormwater drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation, and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage.
Stormwater service fees means the annual fees established under this article and imposed on owners of parcels of land to fund the costs of stormwater management services provided by the stormwater utility and the stormwater utility's operation, maintenance, and improvement of the city stormwater management programs.
The city means City of Winder, Georgia, and its mayor, council and employees.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)
Sec. 24-222. - Findings.
modified
The City of Winder acknowledges the following findings of fact:
(1)
The city is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city.
(2)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(3)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its city Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal.
(4)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the city's service area.
(5)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city's service area and surrounding areas.
(6)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management programs and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management programs and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city's service area. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs.
(7)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the public sanitary sewer system and private septic systems thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into those systems.
(8)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management program and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(9)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city's service area in concert with other water resource management programs.
(10)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city's service area. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management program and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the city's service area is consistent with the present needs of the community.
(11)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways.
(12)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management programs and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof.
(13)
A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city's service area, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city's service area through stormwater service fee charges and other mechanisms.
(14)
The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service fee charge.
(15)
A schedule of stormwater service fees based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city's service area. Such stormwater service fees may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(16)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all stormwater service fees, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of stormwater service fees and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)
Sec. 24-223. - Establishment of a stormwater utility and stormwater enterprise fund.
modified
(a)
There is hereby established a stormwater utility within and under the supervision of the city's department of stormwater management, which stormwater utility shall be responsible for providing stormwater management services, for providing stormwater management programs and related facilities, and for determining labor, material and administrative fees for the operation of the city's stormwater management programs.
(b)
The city stormwater enterprise fund, established in 2018 to fund the operation of the city's stormwater management programs and performance of inspections of and repairs to city stormwater management programs and facilities, is hereby designated as a funding mechanism for the stormwater utility and shall continue to operate as a funding mechanism for the maintenance, repair and construction of city stormwater management programs.
(c)
The city hereby transfers to the stormwater utility responsibility for stormwater services, city stormwater management programs and related facilities, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties upon which such facilities are located, and related easements, rights-of-entry and access rights.
(d)
The city finance department shall maintain the stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, charges, rates, fees and licenses as may be established from time to time by the mayor and city council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust and expended exclusively for the purposes of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to repayment of loans and capital project construction. No other funds of the city shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater utility funds, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including grants, loans, loans from the general fund and bond proceeds, may be combined with and applied to stormwater utility capital projects as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council, upon recommendation of the stormwater coordinator.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)
Sec. 24-224. - Scope of responsibility for the city stormwater management programs.
modified
(a)
The city stormwater management program consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, and other structures, natural or manmade, within the city limits of the city, which control or convey stormwater and through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of the stormwater management program that:
(1)
Are located within city streets, rights-of-way or easements;
(2)
Are subject to city easements, rights of entry, rights of access, rights of use, or other permanent rights of the city for adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management programs and facilities; or
(3)
Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management programs and related facilities.
Operation and maintenance of stormwater management programs and related facilities which are located on private property, or public property not owned by or otherwise accessible pursuant to written property rights to the city, and for which there has been no public dedication of such stormwater management programs and related facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of such stormwater management programs and related facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the applicable property owner or occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of either the state or federal government.
(b)
It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city.
(c)
If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management program or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its council members, mayor, officers, employees or agents.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)
Sec. 24-225. - Requirements for commercial and industrial on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections.
modified
All owners and developers of developed commercial or industrial parcels within the city developed or constructed after July 24, 2018, and such parcels that have existing stormwater facilities shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management programs sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all federal, state, and city regulations. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found to exist by the court, which nuisance the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such remedial work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Barrow County. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)
Sec. 24-226. - Determination and modification of stormwater service fees.
modified
Stormwater service fees shall be based upon an estimate of stormwater runoff from a property and shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the city council. The area of impervious surface on each parcel shall be calculated as of January 1 preceding each fiscal year. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the objective of the city to establish rates and fees that are fair and reasonable, which may include flat fee rates for certain classifications of properties, reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities to those properties that benefit therefrom and which, together with any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility, will be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for construction and improvements to the city stormwater management programs. Future capital investments and necessary reserve accounts, including but not limited to an emergency reserve account, may be included in the calculation of the stormwater service fees.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)
Sec. 24-227. - Effective date of stormwater service fees.
modified
(a)
An annual service charge is imposed upon each parcel of developed land in the city as of July 1 each fiscal year, effective July 1, 2018, to fund stormwater utility programs. This annual service charge shall be known as the "stormwater service fee." Stormwater service fees shall be maintained in the stormwater enterprise fund by the city. Purchases by the stormwater utility shall be made through the Stormwater Management program for the sole purpose of performing the obligations of the stormwater utility.
(b)
Stormwater service fees supporting stormwater utility needs will be determined for each fiscal year and will be approved by resolution during the budgeting process by the city.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)
Sec. 24-228. - Stormwater service fee billing, delinquencies, collections.
modified
(a)
A stormwater service fee bill shall be attached to and/or included in the annual property tax bill generated by the county tax commissioner. The stormwater service fee is due as stated on said bill as well as past due late charges. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the county, shall be ultimately obligated to pay the stormwater service fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back-bill for a period of up to four (4) years, but shall not assess penalties, other than the late charge for delinquency as described in this section. The inclusion of the stormwater service fees with the annual tax bill is intended for convenience only, such stormwater service fee are fees for utility services provided to customers by the stormwater utility and are not a tax or regulatory fee.
(b)
The city reserves the right to place stormwater service fees on utility bills in lieu of a tax bill or when a tax bill on a property is not a feasible option to collect the stormwater service fees on a property.
(c)
Suits for collection of unpaid stormwater service fees shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. No lien shall be imposed for delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained.
(d)
Unpaid stormwater service fees may be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby.
(e)
A late charge of ten (10) percent of the amount due per year shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater service fee that becomes delinquent. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner.
(Ord. (W-3-18) of 7-24-18)

modified
(a)
Any property owner may request a review and adjustment of their stormwater service fee by submitting a request in writing, along with any supporting information, to the stormwater coordinator within thirty (30) days after the date the tax bill is mailed or issued to the property owner. Grounds for modification of the stormwater service fee include, complete demolition and removal of all impervious surfaces on the parcel in question making up greater than fifty (50) square feet of impervious surface area subject to documentation and city personnel inspection. The filing of a request for review does not excuse payment of the fee when due.
(b)
The stormwater coordinator shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater service fee charge as approved by the city.
(c)
Reserved.
(d)
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information at the request of the stormwater coordinator including, but not limited to, an "as-built" survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer if the stormwater coordinator cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater coordinator, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request.
(e)
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater coordinator, the city shall have thirty (30) calendar days within which to render a written decision. If the city fails to render a decision within thirty (30) days, the adjustment request shall automatically be deemed denied, but said denial shall be subject to appeal to the zoning board of appeals. Appeals shall be filed with the zoning board of appeals within thirty (30) days of the denial in accordance with section 24-214.
(f)
In considering an adjustment request, the city shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater service fee for the property is correct.
(g)
The stormwater coordinator decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
(h)
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be paid within forty-five (45) days.

Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the service area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater service fee. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service fees shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. Exemptions to the stormwater service fee are as follows:
(1)
Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater service fee. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service fees.
(2)
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service fee. All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties.
(3)
City and county streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater service fees. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the county and city. However, other improved property used for city and county purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service fee.
(4)
In consideration for the city allowing the stormwater utility to use the city's existing streets, curbs, gutters, drainageways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and manmade within and owned, leased or maintained by the city which controls and diverts surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface and stormwaters; the utility shall not charge the city a stormwater service fee for developed land owned or leased by the city or public rights-of-way owned or maintained by the city.
(5)
Any parcel or lot that is not developed land.

Sec. 24-233. - Enforcement methods and inspections.
modified
(a)
Any violation of this article shall be subject to citation and prosecution in the city municipal court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth the City Code section 1-8.
(b)
In the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater coordinator, code enforcement officer or other city official, the city may sue in the county superior court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the superior court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed.
(c)
The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes:

modified
(a)
Appeals. An appeal to the zoning board of appeals may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater coordinator. The appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of the decision of the stormwater coordinator by filing with the zoning board of appeals a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater coordinator shall forthwith transmit to the zoning board of appeals all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken.
(b)
Hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall fix a time not greater than sixty (60) days after the filing of the appeal for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater coordinator after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater coordinator is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the appeal and applied as a credit to the next year's bill.
(c)
The decision of the zoning board of appeals shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal that decision to the county superior court by writ of certiorari.
