Chapter 34 - FLOODS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 34-1. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives.
The Legislature of the State of Georgia has in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, section 36-1-20, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners of Fannin County, a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, does ordain this chapter.
(Ord. of 6-8-1993, art. 1, § A)
Sec. 34-2. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of Fannin County, a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. of 6-8-1993, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 34-3. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increase in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(Ord. of 6-8-1993, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 34-4. - Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and;
(7)
To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring.
b.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than the level of the base flood elevation, or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade,
3.
The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement,
4.
In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially improved must meet the standards of subsections (4)b.1 and (4)b.3 of this section.
c.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
2.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (4)a or, (4)b.1 and (4)b.3 of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures.
(5)
Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-7, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge;
b.
If subsection (5)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.
c.
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision.
