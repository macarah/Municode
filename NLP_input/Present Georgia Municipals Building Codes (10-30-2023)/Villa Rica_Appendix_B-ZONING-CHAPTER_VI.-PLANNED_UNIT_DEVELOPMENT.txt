CHAPTER VI. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 6.01. - Purpose.
1)
This Chapter is intended to permit the creation of Planned Unit Development (PUD) Districts in accordance with Georgia Code. PUD districts are intended for a parcel of land planned as a single unit which allows for mixed uses and mixed densities under one zoning classification. This Ordinance allows any zoning district to be rezoned for the creation of a PUD district. PUD Districts create neighborhoods that can benefit from innovations in community development, provide greater efficiency in public utilities and services, and preserve open space. All Planned Unit Developments shall be served by centralized sewer and water.
Sec. 6.02. - PUD uses and standards.
1)
USES. All land use classifications that are allowed in this Ordinance may be permitted within a PUD, unless otherwise omitted. All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the City Council. Once uses are approved by the Council, they are granted by right. All land uses proposed in a Planned Unit Development must be compatible with the intent of the Comprehensive Plan and the characteristics of surrounding land uses and zoning districts.
2)
STANDARDS. The development and design standards established in this Ordinance or applicable design guideline documents shall apply unless alternate development or design standards are proposed by the petitioner. The alternate development standards deemed appropriate by the Planning & Zoning Commission in order to accomplish the intent of the Planned Unit Development shall be specified in the PUD District Ordinance that is certified by the Planning & Zoning Commission and adopted by the City Council. Any lessening of the required development and design standards of this Ordinance or applicable design guideline documents shall be directly linked to the intent of the Planned Unit Development to:
a)
Provide a mixed-use development; or
b)
Provide a creative and unique design; or
c)
Address unusual physical conditions on site.
Sec. 6.03. - Procedure summary.
1)
The section establishes procedures for the review, approval and development of a Planned Unit Development District. There are four basic steps in the PUD process which are illustrated in sequence in the flow charts on the following pages and which are described below:
a)
Pre-Submittal Conference . The applicant is encouraged to engage in informal consultations with the Villa Rica Community Development staff prior to preparing plans. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss expectations, schedule, concept and standards contained herein. It shall be understood that no statement or representations by a member of either Staff shall be binding upon either the Council or upon any zoning body.
b)
PUD District Ordinance and Concept Plan . The PUD District Ordinance and Concept Plan is the second step in the process for establishing a Planned Unit Development. During this step, the petitioner's proposed development requirements for the Planned Unit Development are reviewed by the Planning & Zoning Commission and the City Council. The approved standards are codified in a PUD District Ordinance that has the effect of rezoning the subject property to a Planned Unit Development zoning district, and establishing the development requirements that will be applied in all subsequent reviews. A Concept Plan which accompanies the ordinance provides the Planning & Zoning Commission and City Council with a general vision for the development of the site.
c)
Preliminary Plat . The Detailed Development Plan is the third step in the process. In this step, the applicant prepares an overall plan for the site which will be reviewed by staff, the Technical Advisory Committee and approved by the Planning & Zoning Commission. For a Planned Unit Development that is going to be subdivided, this step also serves as the Preliminary Plat.
d)
Final Plat . The Final Plat is the final step in establishing a Planned Unit Development. During this step, the petitioner's specific plan for the entire site or a portion of the site is reviewed by the members of the Technical Advisory Committee. For a Planned Unit Development that is going to be subdivided, this step also serves as the Final Plat.
i)
Options .
(1)
Submission of a Preliminary Plat, processed in the manner described in this Chapter, and the subsequent submission of a Final Plat for any portion of the approved Preliminary Plat the applicant wishes to develop. The Final Plat submitted according to this option shall be processed in the manner described in this Chapter.
(2)
Submission of a Final Plat without a Preliminary Plat, processed in the manner described in this Chapter.
Sec. 6.04. - Pre-submittal conference.
1)
Prior to submitting a Planned Unit Development application, the petitioner shall meet with the Villa Rica Community Development staff to review the zoning classification of the site, review the regulatory ordinances and materials, review the procedures and examine the proposed use and development of the property. Department staff shall aid and advise the applicant in preparing the application and supportive documents as necessary.
Sec. 6.05. - PUD district ordinance and concept plan.
1)
ORIGINATION OF PROPOSALS. Any applicant may propose a Planned Unit Development district in accordance with the procedures established in this Chapter. The applicant shall submit an application and fee for a Planned Unit Development in accordance with this Section, Section 6.03 -Procedure Summary, and the established procedure of the Community Development department. The applicant shall refer to the application packet to determine the format and number of copies of the plans to be delivered.
2)
AREA REQUIREMENTS. The minimum land area required for a Planned Unit Development shall be five (5) acres. However, a development of less than five (5) acres may be considered by the Planning & Zoning Commission for infill projects.
3)
PROJECT OWNERSHIP. The project may be owned, leased, or controlled either by a single person or corporation, or by a group of individuals, or homeowner's association. Such ownership may be a public or private corporation. However, if not under single ownership, the multiple owners must have a contractual agreement (1) not to develop the parcels separately, but in accordance with a single, unified plan, and (2) in which the separate owners have given their express intentions to enter into such private agreements and to assure its completion as planned and to the satisfaction of the Planning & Zoning Commission. The City Council may grant an extension of such time for such a period as it deems in the public interest.
4)
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. In addition to the applicable provisions of this Ordinance, the PUD Ordinance must comply with the following requirements unless specifically waived by the Planning & Zoning Commission:
a)
The Planned Unit Development must be substantially completed within the period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the developer.
b)
The Planned Unit Development will address the public health, safety, and general welfare.
c)
All uses are subject to the discretion and approval of the City Council.
d)
The PUD Ordinance shall address the impact on traffic and public services and facilities, such as schools, fire and police protection. A Fiscal Impact Analysis shall be required for developments of one-hundred fifty (150) or more residential units. The Planning & Zoning Commission may also request a Fiscal Impact Analysis or a traffic study for projects under one-hundred fifty (150) units at their discretion. These studies shall address the impact of the proposed Planned Unit Development on all adjacent streets and intersections.
e)
The PUD Ordinance shall contain such proposed covenants, easements and other provisions relating to the proposed development standards, as reasonably are required for public health, safety and general welfare.
f)
Gross residential density shall be calculated by dividing the gross acreage of the total development area by the size of the recommended lots to determine total dwelling units per acre in the proposed project.
g)
Open Space shall be required in accordance with Section 7.13 -Open Space Requirements.
5)
