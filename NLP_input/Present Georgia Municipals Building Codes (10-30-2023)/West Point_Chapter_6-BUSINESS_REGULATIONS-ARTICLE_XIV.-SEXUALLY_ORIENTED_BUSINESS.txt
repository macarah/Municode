ARTICLE XIV. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS

Sec. 6-351. - Rationale and findings.
(a)
Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. It is neither the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
Note: The United States Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment protects non-obscene, sexually explicit materials and entertainment. Notwithstanding, the Court has stated that government may regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to eliminate or control the adverse secondary effects caused by these businesses. These adverse secondary effects include, but are not limited to, crime, sexually transmitted diseases, urban blight, declining property values, and lower quality of life. Enactment of legislation regulating sexually oriented businesses must be supported by factual findings of adverse secondary effects made by the enacting body.
Case law annotations: Courts normally review content-based restrictions on speech under "strict scrutiny" review, and require government to show a "compelling state interest" for the restriction. However, the Supreme Court has stated that, because restrictions on sexually explicit speech are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, the proper level of review is whether the regulation is narrowly tailored to a substantial government interest. See County of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, 475 U.S. 41,48(1986); United States v. O'brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). Here, the substantial government interest is combating adverse secondary effects. If the ordinance targeted the speech itself, the test would be strict scrutiny, a burden almost impossible to meet.
(b)

The Mayor and Council of the City of West Point, Georgia find that:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
(2)
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from certain land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and the surrounding area, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one (1) area.
(3)
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes harm that the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
(4)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
(5)
Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Bames v. Glen Theatre 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991).
(6)
Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986).
(7)
Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. See, e.g., Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. County of Warner Robins, 223 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir. 2000); Sammy's Ltd. v. County of Mobile, 140 F.3d 993, 996 (11th Cir. 1998), cent. denied, 529 U.S. 1052, 146 L. Ed. 2d 459, 120 S. Ct. 1553 (2000).
(8)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(9)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(10)
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments.
(11)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity.
(12)
It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
(13)
The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article.
(14)
The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five (5) years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(15)
The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(16)
The findings noted in subsections (b)(1)—(15) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.
