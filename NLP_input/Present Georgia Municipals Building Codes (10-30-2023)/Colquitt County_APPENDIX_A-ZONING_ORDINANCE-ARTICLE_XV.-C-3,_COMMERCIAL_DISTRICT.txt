ARTICLE XV. - C-3, COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

Section 15.01. - Statement of purpose.
The commercial district as established in this article is intended to be that permitting retail as well as wholesale business activities, including certain small fabricating and manufacturing operations which require a central location and which can be serviced from major thoroughfares. The intent of this district is to permit those uses in areas designated on the comprehensive development plan, which can be integrated with nearby residential areas without adverse effects, and which will benefit by being near a labor supply and related retail activities. The permitted uses in this district are principally oriented to those having infrequent vehicular access and are not like those retail business activities in the local business or general business districts which generate considerable pedestrian traffic. As such, they are appropriately located along major thoroughfares.
