ARTICLE XXIII: - STANDARDS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES

Section 1: - Purpose and Intent
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Butler's authority concerning the placement, construction, and modification of towers, antennas, and the facilities whereon towers or antennas are located. This section is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Butler, telecommunication providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Butler, Georgia so as to protect the health, safety, and integrity of residential neighborhoods and to foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. This section shall not prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, the provision of personal wireless services. This section is intended to promote the City of Butler, Georgia as a proactive city in the availability of personal telecommunications service. To that end, this section shall:
A.
Provide the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities within the City of Butler, Georgia;
B.
Protect the City of Butler, Georgia's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunication facilities;
C.
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunication facilities through careful design, siting, and landscaping screening and innovated camouflaging techniques;
D.
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antenna failure through engineering and careful siting of towers and antennas failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas;
E.
Maximize the use of any new and existing towers through co-location so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the City of Butler, Georgia;
F.
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single use towers;
G.
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications activities in areas which are not zoned for residential use; and

a.
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements;
