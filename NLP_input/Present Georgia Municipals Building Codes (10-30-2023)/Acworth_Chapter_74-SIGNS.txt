ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 74-1. - Purpose and findings.
We, the mayor and board of aldermen of the City of Acworth, find that the following regulations are necessary to our fundamental goals of protecting the health, safety and welfare of residents, visitors and businesses in the City of Acworth.
A sign is by nature designed to draw attention. This characteristic makes signs a valuable medium of communication. However, this same characteristic distracts motorists and pedestrians and can degrade the aesthetic character of a place. Thus signs must be regulated to insure that they contribute to rather than detract from the visage of the community. Proper regulation is necessary to limit the negative impact of signs while encouraging the positive and constructive uses of signs. The city has an interest in regulating signage for public safety and aesthetic purposes. By limiting the number and size of signs within the city, this chapter directly operates to reduce visual clutter for the motoring public.
This chapter regulates signs by establishing signage districts. These districts are determined by geography: the confluence of topography, flora, economy, and society. Size, height, materials, number, location on a lot, methods of construction, maintenance, and illumination are dictated by this chapter. It is believed that such controls will improve the general appearance of the City of Acworth; protect the lives and health of residents and visitors; protect public investments; have a positive impact upon the economy of the city; and enhance the attractiveness of Acworth as a place to live, recreate, and do business.
Signs are a valuable means of commercial advertising and noncommercial speech. This chapter is intended to reasonably regulate signs in the City of Acworth while showing full deference to the right to engage in constitutionally protected speech. It shall hereafter be unlawful for any person to erect, place, or maintain a sign in the city except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

ARTICLE II. - PERMANENT SIGNS

Sec. 74-41. - Policies.
(a)
In general, commercial and industrial owners are encouraged to develop the public identity of their operations through high-quality and innovative structural design. Signs should adhere to the architectural motifs set forth by the building but should not be relied upon as the sole means of identification.
(b)
Signs shall be in proportion with and visually related to the streetscape and scale of the area in the city.
(c)
Unless excepted by this chapter, all signs within the city shall be constructed of wood, masonry, glass, and/or high-grade metal.
(d)
Signs shall follow specific guidelines concerning height, materials, color, and size.
(e)
Signs may serve to identify the business, structure, activity, or parcel at its location of business. Signs may also serve to express protected non-commercial messages.
(f)
Freestanding monument or pedestal signs shall not extend over public property or right-of-way.
(g)
Free standing monument or pedestal signs shall be composed of the primary materials of the front façade of the building. The zoning administrator shall have the discretion to approve other materials of a higher quality should those materials be in conformance with the size, shape, scope, and design of the building or nearby structures.
(h)
The signing for new businesses within existing projects shall comply with the provisions of this chapter.
(i)
Sign design should be guided by the following general principles:
(1)
Permeability: The ease with which an individual unfamiliar with a place is able to move about using available signage.
(2)
Context: Sensitivity to the prevailing urban context (color, material, mass, function).
(3)
Place: As visible parts of the urban landscape, signs are a tactile part of the character of a place.
(4)
Creativity: Within given limits, signs can help beautify the built environment.
(Ord. No. 2019-17, § 22, 6-6-2019)
Sec. 74-42. - Signage districts and standards.
(a)
The design guidelines in this chapter shall be applied according to the boundaries of sign districts. Based on prevailing patterns of topography, flora, economy, and society, the districts were established to provide clear guidelines for the design and development of signage. To a great extent, the districts conform to the patterns of land use established by the city's existing and future land use maps. District boundaries can be established, revoked, or modified only by action of the city's board of aldermen. The boundaries of each district are outlined in the Acworth Sign District Map. The city reserves the right to assign property beyond the limits of the sign district map to specific district in the event of its annexation in the city limits. In the event a sign district is not assigned, at the time of annexation, the annexed property shall automatically be included in the residential sign district.
(b)
In all districts, there shall be only one ground sign per frontage, unless specifically allowed in a district or otherwise approved by the mayor and board of aldermen. Planned shopping center, office, commercial, industrial parks and mixed use centers are encouraged to use one free-standing monument sign per common frontage.
(c)
Paintings on structures, which convey a message, are considered signs and are governed by this chapter.
(d)

(b)
Central business district (CBD).
(1)
The total square footage of all signage shall be determined according to the number of linear feet of street frontage per business in a freestanding structure on a single lot, or linear feet of business frontage for a multi-tenant structure, at the rate of one square foot of sign for one linear foot of frontage. In cases where a multi-tenant structure has two primary entrances, a front and a rear, that are architecturally similar in façade and are both fully accessible by the public, the maximum allowable sign area shall be calculated at a rate of one and one-half square foot of sign for one linear foot of business frontage. Only one, the primary, frontage may be utilized in this calculation and the total area shall be allocated into signage for both entrances. This area may not be utilized towards a single frontage; a sign must be placed on both frontages. Signs may be monument, wall-mounted, sandwich board, awning, window, or hanging. In no event shall wall signs exceed more than 30 percent of the wall area on which they are displayed. Monument signs shall be less than five feet in height, measured from the level of the crown of the adjacent road to the highest point on the sign structure and be set at least five feet from any property line. Each lot shall have no more than one monument sign. Hanging and awning signs shall be a minimum of eight feet above the grade of the public right-of-way as measured from the bottom of the sign structure to the pavement directly below and shall have no point higher than the highest point of the building façade.
