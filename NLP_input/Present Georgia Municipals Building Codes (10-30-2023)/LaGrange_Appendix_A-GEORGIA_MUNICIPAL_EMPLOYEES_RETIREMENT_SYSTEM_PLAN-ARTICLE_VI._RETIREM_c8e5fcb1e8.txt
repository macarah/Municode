ARTICLE VI. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Section 6.01. - Normal Retirement Benefit.
(a)
A Participant, upon Retirement on or after his Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable), shall receive a Monthly Retirement Benefit under which payments shall commence on the last day of the month in which his effective Retirement Date occurs and shall be payable on the last day of each month thereafter during his lifetime. However, if directed by the Employer, Normal Retirement Benefits may be paid retroactively to the last day of the month following the month in which the Participant's Termination occurs (or, if the Participant's Termination occurs on the first of the month, the last day of said month) or if later, the last day of the month in which his Normal Retirement Date occurs. The amount of the Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be determined based upon the applicable benefit formula specified in the Adoption Agreement and in effect at the Participant's Termination. If the Participant elects a form of benefit payment other than the standard form, the amount of the Monthly Retirement Benefit will be adjusted in accordance with and subject to the terms of the option elected (see Section 7.01). Effective November 1, 2007, all references in this subsection to "last day" shall be changed to "first day."
(b)
No interest shall be paid on the retroactive payment of Normal Retirement benefits.
Section 6.02. - Early Retirement Benefit.
(a)
A Participant, upon Retirement on or after his Early Retirement Date and before his Normal Retirement Date or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, shall receive a Monthly Retirement Benefit under which payments shall commence on the last day of the month in which his effective Retirement Date occurs and shall be payable on the last day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the Participant. The amount of such Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a Normal Retirement Benefit, but reduced on an Actuarially Equivalent basis in accordance with the actuarial table contained in Section 12.01. An Adopting Employer may adopt in the Adoption Agreement an alternative early retirement actuarial reduction table for one or more classes of Eligible Employees, provided the adoption of such table satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(25). Effective November 1, 2007, all references in this subsection to "last day" shall be changed to "first day."
(b)
Provided the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to provide Disability benefits, a Participant who is otherwise eligible for an Early Retirement Benefit may apply for and receive an Early Retirement benefit while a Disability benefit determination is pending. Upon a determination that the Participant is entitled to receive a Disability benefit, the Participant's benefit will be changed to a Disability Benefit (if greater), retroactive to the Disability Retirement Date. However, no change in the form of benefit payment or designation of the Post-Retirement Beneficiary may be made, and no Post-Retirement Beneficiary may be named if one had not been previously named.
(c)
Retroactive payment of Early Retirement benefits to the Participant's Early Retirement Date or date of Termination is not permitted.
Section 6.03. - Late Retirement Benefit.
A Participant may retire from the active Service of the Adopting Employer on the first day of any month after his Normal Retirement Date, in which case the Participant shall receive a Late Retirement Benefit. The Late Retirement Benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the Normal Retirement Benefit. However, the Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide for an increased Late Retirement Benefit, in which case the Late Retirement Benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the Normal Retirement Benefit, but increased as provided in the Adoption Agreement.
Section 6.04. - Disability Benefit.
(a)
Provided the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to provide Disability benefits, a Participant who becomes Disabled and is otherwise entitled to receive a Disability Retirement Benefit shall receive such benefit in accordance with this Section. Payments shall commence on the last day of the month coinciding with the Participant's Disability Retirement Date and shall be payable on the last day of said month and of each month thereafter during the Participant's Disability. No Disability benefit shall be payable unless application for such benefit is made within one (1) year after employment is terminated as a result of such Disability, except when the delay is caused by the pendency of a Disability determination by the Social Security Administration or the Pension Committee, as applicable. The amount of the monthly Disability Retirement Benefit shall be determined as provided in the Adoption Agreement. The Adopting Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to specify another method for calculation of the benefit, and require an offset against the monthly Disability Retirement Benefit for other types of payments received by the Participant. Upon Retirement, the Participant shall receive the monthly Disability Retirement Benefit provided in this Section, or any other Monthly Retirement Benefit granted under the Plan for which he is eligible if such benefit is greater than the aforesaid monthly Disability Retirement Benefit. However, under no circumstances shall any Retired Participant be entitled at one time to more than one type of Retirement benefit granted under the Plan. Effective November 1, 2007 all references in this subsection to "last day" shall be changed to "first day."
(b)
No interest shall be paid on the retroactive payment of Disability benefits.
Section 6.05. - Cost of Living Adjustment.
(a)
An Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide for a variable annual cost-of-living adjustment in the amount of benefits payable under the Plan to Participants or their Beneficiaries. In such event, the amount of benefits payable under the Plan shall be adjusted as provided in this Section, except as otherwise provided in the Employer's Adoption Agreement.
(b)
The Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure as defined in Section 2.19 shall be ascertained as of January 1 in each year.
(c)
Each Monthly Retirement Benefit then being received by Participants who terminate after the date specified in the Adoption Agreement and their Beneficiaries shall thereupon be adjusted as follows:
(1)
Each Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be increased by the percentage that the Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure increased over each recipient's Cost-of-Living Base Figure, as defined in Section 2.15. If the Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure is less than the Cost-of-Living Base Figure, no reduction in the Monthly Retirement Benefit, shall be effected. Increased benefits are payable at the end of the month in which the adjustment is made.
(2)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no increase in the amount of a Monthly Retirement Benefit due to changes in the Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure effective at any annual adjustment date (January 1) shall be in excess of a certain percentage of the amount of the Monthly Retirement Benefit payable immediately prior to each Participant's or Beneficiary's applicable adjustment date. Said percentage limit shall be designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement.
(d)
An Adopting Employer may implement one-time or ad-hoc cost-of-living adjustments by adopting an Addendum to the Adoption Agreement to effect said increase.
(e)
In lieu of the variable cost-of-living adjustment referred to in subsections (a)â€”(c) above, the Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide for a fixed annual cost-of-living adjustment, subject to any limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code or regulations issued thereunder.
Section 6.06. - Suspension of Benefits.
(a)
General Rule. Unless otherwise provided in this Section and in the Adoption Agreement, if a Retired Participant returns to Service as an Eligible Employee with an Adopting Employer from whose Trust Fund the Retired Participant is receiving a Monthly Retirement Benefit, said Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be suspended as of the date of said return to Service. The Adopting Employer may engage on a retainer or fee basis any person receiving benefits hereunder and such engagement will not terminate or suspend such benefits. In such case, said person will not accrue benefits or service credit for any purpose under the Plan during said period of reemployment.
(b)
Re-Computation of Benefit in Case of Suspension. In any case where the payment of a Participant's Retirement benefit shall have been suspended, the Retirement benefit payable on his re-retirement (whether before or after his Normal Retirement Date) shall be the benefit computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of his aggregate Total Credited Service at the time of his subsequent re-retirement, but reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by him prior to his return to Service as an Eligible Employee, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefits received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting benefit be less than the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. A Retired Participant who is reemployed as an Eligible Employee shall not be authorized to change his form of benefit payment on his subsequent re-retirement, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previously named. For the purposes of this Section, any such Participant's Credited Service subsequent to his reemployment by the Employer as an Eligible Employee shall commence as of the date of his reemployment as an Eligible Employee.
(c)
Reemployment After Normal Retirement Date; In-Service Distribution. Notwithstanding the requirement for suspension of benefits upon reemployment under subsection (a) above, an Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to permit Retired Participants or certain classes of Retired Participants to continue receiving Retirement benefits if they return to Service with the Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee on or after their Normal Retirement Date. The Employer may also elect to permit Retired Participants or certain classes of Retired Participants to continue receiving Retirement benefits if they return to Service with the Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee on or after their Alternative Normal Retirement Date. If the Employer has made such an election in the Adoption Agreement, then Retired Participants who are designated in the Adoption Agreement as eligible to receive in-service distributions may continue to receive their Monthly Retirement Benefit if they return to Service with the Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee on or after their Normal Retirement Date or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable. Upon said Participants' subsequent re-retirement, their Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of their aggregate Total Credited Service at the time of re-retirement, but it shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received prior to re-retirement, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at the previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefits received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting benefit be less than the benefit payable at the time of the previous Retirement. A Retired Participant who returns to Service as an Eligible Employee shall not be authorized to change his form of benefit payment, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary on his subsequent re-retirement, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previously named.
(d)
Reemployment Prior to Normal Retirement Date; In-Service Distribution Upon Attaining Normal Retirement Date. This subsection shall apply only if an Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to permit in-service distribution of benefits upon reemployment after the Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable) pursuant to subsection (c) above, and if the Retired Participant belongs to a class for which in-service distributions are permitted under the Adoption Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) below, if a Retired Participant returns to Service as an Eligible Employee with the Adopting Employer before his Normal Retirement Date, his Retirement benefit payments shall be suspended in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) above. However, if after becoming reemployed said Participant remains employed until his Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable), and if the Participant is otherwise eligible to receive a Normal Retirement Benefit, the Participant may apply for and receive a Monthly Retirement Benefit on or after his Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable), notwithstanding his continued Service with the Employer. Said Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in accordance with this Article, based upon the Participant's Total Credited Service through the date he recommences receipt of his Monthly Retirement Benefit pursuant to this subsection, but it shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by the Participant prior to his return to Service, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefit payments received, determined as of the date the Participant recommences receipt of his Monthly Retirement Benefit, and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting Monthly Retirement Benefit be less than the Participant's initial Monthly Retirement Benefit. Upon the Participant's subsequent re-retirement, his Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be re-computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of his aggregate Total Credited Service at the time of his re-retirement, reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by him prior to his re-retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefit payments received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting Monthly Retirement Benefit be less than the prior Monthly Retirement Benefit. The Participant shall not be authorized under this subsection to change his form of benefit payment, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previously named.
(e)
Reemployment After Early Retirement Date; In-Service Distribution. An Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to permit Retired Participants or certain classes of Retired Participants who are receiving an Early Retirement benefit to continue receiving said benefit if they return to Service with the Employer as an Eligible Employee at any time on or after their Early Retirement Date. If the Employer has made such an election, and if a Retired Participant belongs to a class for which such in-service distributions are permitted, then upon the Retired Participant's return to Service with the Employer as an Eligible Employee after his Early Retirement Date, the Retired Participant may continue to receive his Monthly Retirement Benefit during the period of his reemployment. However, this provision shall apply only if the Participant's previous Retirement was in good faith and the Participant does not return to Service as an Eligible Employee following his initial effective Retirement date for a minimum period designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement which shall not be less than six (6) months. Upon the Participant's subsequent re-retirement, his Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of his aggregate Credited Service at the time of his re-retirement, but it shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by him prior to his re-Retirement, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at his previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefit received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting benefit be less than the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. Such a Participant shall not be authorized to change his form of benefit payment on his subsequent re-retirement, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previous named.
(f)
Death in Service After Reemployment. If a Retired Participant returns to Service with an Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee and he dies during the period of his reemployment and before re-retirement, then his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, if any, shall be entitled to receive the greater of: (1) the monthly post-retirement survivor benefit payable, if any; or (2) the monthly in-service death benefit, if any, payable for the class of Eligible Employees to which the Participant belongs as of his date of death, reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by the Participant prior to his death. This provision shall not be interpreted to permit payment to a Pre-Retirement Beneficiary in the event of a Retired Participant's death during reemployment.
(g)
Suspension of Disability Benefits. Any Disability Retirement Benefit payable under the Plan to any Participant shall be suspended as of the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date his Disability ceases. A Participant's Disability shall be considered to have ceased upon the earliest of the following dates: (1) with respect to Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, the date as of which the Social Security Administration determines that the Participant is no longer disabled; or (2) with respect to Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon a determination by the Pension Committee, the date as of which the Pension Committee determines that the Participant is no longer disabled as defined under Code Section 72(m), based upon an examination by a physician chosen by the Pension Committee. With respect to those Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, the Participant shall be required to notify the Pension Committee Secretary within sixty (60) days after the Participant receives notice that the Social Security Administration has determined that the Participant is no longer disabled. With respect to those Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, the Pension Committee shall have the right to require the Participant to prove at any time, as a condition for continued receipt of Disability benefits under the Plan, continued eligibility for receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, as amended. With respect to Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon a determination of Disability by the Pension Committee, the Pension Committee shall have the right to require, as a condition for continued receipt of Disability benefits, that the Participant be examined at any time by a physician chosen by the Pension Committee. In the event that any Participant fails or refuses to submit to a physical examination or to obtain and provide other information requested by the Pension Committee to confirm continuation of a Disability, then the Participant's Disability benefits shall be suspended as of the first day of the month following expiration of the ninety (90) day period following the Pension Committee's request for such examination or information, unless the Pension Committee determines in its discretion that the failure to comply was due to circumstances beyond the Participant's control, in which case the ninety (90) day time limit may be extended by the Pension Committee.
(h)
Suspension of Disability Benefit; Right to Other Benefits. In any case where the payment of a Participant's Disability Retirement benefit is suspended, the period of absence from employment due to such Disability shall be treated as a leave of absence without pay, except that such period of absence shall not be counted as Credited Service. Any Participant who shall have retired or been retired for Disability and who dies or who has been or shall be subsequently declared ineligible for a Disability Retirement Benefit because of the cessation of said Disability shall have a right to any benefit afforded under any other provision of this Plan to which he or his Beneficiary might otherwise be entitled. In such case, any Disability Retirement payments made prior to the date as of which his Disability ceases or as of which it is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the Retiree and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under the Plan.
