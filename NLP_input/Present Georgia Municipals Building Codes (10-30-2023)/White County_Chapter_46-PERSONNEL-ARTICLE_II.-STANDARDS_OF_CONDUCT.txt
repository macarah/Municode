If you believe that you have been harassed, you should immediately report the incident as set out above. If you are uncomfortable with reporting the harassment to these individuals or if you believe that your complaint was not properly addressed, you should report the incident to the chairman of the board of commissioners.
b.

Even if the investigation produces insufficient evidence to support the complaint, there shall be no discrimination or retaliation against any employee filing a good-faith harassment complaint.
c.
There shall be no discrimination or retaliation against an employee, who participates in the investigation of a harassment complaint. If the investigation substantiates the complaint, appropriated corrective and/or disciplinary action up to and including discharge will be pursued.

d.
Actions taken internally to investigate and resolve harassment complaints shall be conducted confidentially to the extent practicable, appropriate, and consistent with the Georgia Open Records Act in order to protect the privacy of persons involved.
(4)
General provisions.
a.
If a harassment complaint is directed against the director of human resources, county manager or elected official, the functions assigned to those people by these procedures will be transferred to the county board of commissioners.
b.
Retaliatory action of any kind taken because of an employee seeking redress under these procedures is prohibited, and shall be regarded as a separate and distinct cause for complaint and discipline under these procedures.

Sec. 46-35. - Information technology acceptable use policy.
This section constitutes the policy for all county employees regarding the access, use, security and monitoring of the county's computer systems, network, e-mail and internet access.
The primary purpose for the county network and all county information technology resources is to support and facilitate the business of the county as defined by the county commissioners and the county manager. Use of these resources for other purposes must be approved by the county commissioners, county manager and I.T. department prior to that use.
The information technology resources of the county shall not be used for any activity that violates federal, state or local laws or any other applicable policy or statute. Specifically, but not meant as a comprehensive list, the county network will not be used to transmit offensive materials, hate mail, discriminatory remarks, obtain or transmit pornographic materials, communicate racial or ethnic slurs or anything that may be construed as harassment of others based on their race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability or religious or political beliefs. Further, the county network shall not be used for commercial or profit enterprises, lobbying, advertising, religious material, political causes, outside organizations, or other non-government related solicitations.
All users will be given a user account for access to the county network. User accounts will be protected by passwords to prevent unauthorized use. User accounts are to be used only by the authorized owner of the account and only for authorized purposes. Users will not permit the use of their account by anyone else. Any attempt to gain another individual's password, use another person's account or to circumvent password or other security measures is a violation of this policy.
No user shall perform any action that disrupts or denies another user's access to the county network or other information technology resources. Heavy usage or high-demand activities that disrupt or significantly reduce the overall performance of the network should be avoided and may be restricted or rescheduled in order to maintain acceptable internet/network response times throughout the system.
All data, information and files accessible via the county network are considered to be the private property of the county and shall not be disclosed except for legitimate county purposes consistent with this and any other applicable policy. Except in the course of genuine county business, users shall not damage, destroy, modify or copy information, files, data or passwords available on or via the county network.
Illegal use of copyrighted software is prohibited on any and all systems in the county network.
Network services, internet access and email services may be provided to county employees. The primary purpose of these accounts and services is to support and facilitate the business of the county as defined by the county commissioners and the county manager. Incidental personal use of these systems may occur, but such usage must not interfere with efficient and timely completion of county business activities or negatively impact the performance of the network. No user should attempt to gain access to another user's personal files or emails without prior, expressed consent from that user. The county may terminate the availability of the internet or email services at any time in its sole discretion.
In no event shall the county be liable to any user for any damages, whether direct, indirect, special or consequential arising out of the use of the internet, accuracy or correctness of data bases or information contained therein or related, directly or indirectly, to any failure or delay of the county in providing access to the internet or email.
All computers, communication, activity and all information stored, received or transmitted using the county network shall be assumed to be the property of the county and are to be used primarily for job-related purposes. Any email messages sent or received using the county network are considered property of the county.
To ensure proper use of the network and computer resources, the county may monitor the use of these systems, information and equipment at any time. All users understand that there is no right of privacy associated with the county's computer equipment. In this regard, the county has the right to monitor all activities and communications, retain records of all activities and communications and use this information in any manner permitted by law.
Violators of this policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment.

(Res. No. 2023-03, 2-14-23)
Sec. 46-37. - Social media policy.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this policy is to establish guidelines for employees and/or volunteers who engage in social media activity as defined herein. This policy is not intended to prohibit any employee's and/or volunteer's personal expression in general or through social media activity in particular; however, because such activity can adversely affect the efficiency and effectiveness of county operations, as well as undermine public trust and confidence, a certain amount of regulation is necessary and appropriate. This policy therefore attempts to strike a reasonable balance between the employees' and/or volunteers' interest in engaging in social media activity and the county's interest in preventing unnecessary disruption to or interference with its operations and relationship to the public it serves.
(b)
Definitions.
(1)
For purposes of this policy, the term "social media" is defined as the online technologies through which employees and/or volunteers and other individuals engage in "social media activity" as defined below. In most cases, the term refers to internet-based websites such as MySpace®, Facebook®, Twitter®, Linkedin®, Google+®, YouTube®, Tumblr®, and Blogger®. Online social media technologies covered by this policy also include, but are not limited to, such applications as web logs/blogs, video logs/vlogs, message boards, podcasts, and wikis.
(2)
For purposes of this policy, the term, "social media activity" is defined as the act of sharing information or otherwise communicating through social media, including, but not limited to, the posting, uploading, reviewing, downloading, and/or forwarding of text, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs/images, symbols, or hyperlinks.
(c)
Scope of policy.
(1)
This policy applies to all employees and/or volunteers of the county without regard to whether their social media activity is conducted in or outside the workplace, while on or off-duty, or anonymously or through the use of pseudonyms.
(2)
This policy applies to all employees and/or volunteers of the county without regard to job title, position or rank; however, with the approval of the sheriff's office, and any other department or affiliated agency of the county having special or unique concerns pertaining to its employees and/or volunteers' social media activity may adopt and implement more restrictive SOP's or other internal rules narrowly designed to address such concerns.
(d)
Prohibitions on social media activity.
(1)
All employees and/or volunteers of the county should remain mindful that, as public servants, they are generally held to higher standards than the general public with regard to their on-duty and off-duty conduct, professionalism, and ethics. As a result, certain social media activity that may be tolerated or even acceptable in the private sector may nevertheless constitute a violation of this policy.
(2)
Each employee and/or volunteer of the county who engages in social media activity must take personal responsibility for ensuring that such activity is consistent with all policies of the county, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to making false or misleading statements, promoting or endorsing violence or illegal activity, promoting or endorsing the abuse of alcohol or drugs, disparaging individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other characteristics protected by law, or otherwise engaging in conduct unbecoming an employee and/or volunteer of the county, bringing discredit to the county, or interfering with or detrimental to the mission or function of the county.
(3)
Employees and/or volunteers must refrain from engaging in any social media activity which disqualifies them from performing, or in any way reasonably calls into question their ability to objectively perform, any essential function of their jobs. Examples of such functions include, but are not limited to, testifying, making hiring or promotion decisions or recommendations, conducting performance evaluations, and determining eligibility for county programs.
(4)
While any employee, at his/her discretion, may engage in social media activity with any other employee(s) consistent with the prohibitions, limitations and restrictions, and guidelines of this policy, no employee may be required or otherwise compelled to engage in such activity with another employee.
(5)
No employee, whether for purposes of engaging in social media activity or otherwise, may disclose or otherwise reveal any privileged or confidential information of the county, any other current or former employee of the county, or any applicant for employment with the county.
(e)
Limitations and restrictions on social media activity.
(1)
Employees and/or volunteers are strongly discouraged from disclosing or otherwise revealing their status as employees and/or volunteers of the county through social media and, except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly representing themselves to be speaking on behalf of the county. Similarly, in the absence of prior approval, employee's and/or volunteer's social media activity should not reveal or depict the county's adopted logos, seals, symbols, uniforms, patches, badges, or similar items identified with the county.
(2)
Except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, if an employee's and/or volunteer's status as an employee of the county is disclosed, revealed, or otherwise made apparent in connection with his/her social media activity, his/her social media activity must include a prominently displayed disclaimer to the effect that the activity reflects only the employee's and/or volunteer's personal views or opinions and not those of the county; provided, however, that no disclaimer will shield an employee from the imposition of appropriate corrective and/or disciplinary action for social media activity which otherwise violates this policy. Employees and/or volunteers should recognize that social media activity is generally more likely to violate this policy and other policies of the county if their status as county employees and/or volunteers is disclosed or revealed in connection therewith.
(3)
Except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, no employee may utilize county computers or equipment for purposes of engaging in social media activity.
(4)
Except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, no employee, whether for purposes of engaging in social media activity or otherwise, may post or upload any information, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs/images, etc. from county computers or equipment.
(5)
To preserve the continuity of the county's message, ensure accuracy, and avoid unnecessary confusion in the community, except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager and/or the supervising elected official, employees and/or volunteers should refrain from engaging in any social media activity that purports or serves to announce or explain the details of county programs, projects, activities, initiatives, or events.
(6)
Exceptions to the above-stated limitations and restrictions may be authorized by the county manager or the supervising elected official; provided, however, that any request for such an exception represents a promise by the employee and or volunteer that, if approved, the disclosure of information, photographs, audio, video, etc. via social media activity will be fully consistent with the letter and spirit of this and all other policies of the county, any internal SOP's or rules adopted by his/her department director, as well as any laws pertaining to copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and privacy and reputational rights.
(7)
The county reserves the right to require any employee and/or volunteer to remove immediately any posted or uploaded text, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs/images, etc. (even if previously approved) if such posted material constitutes a violation of this policy or other county policies.
(f)
Application to other policies. All personnel policies of the county relating to employee and/or volunteer conduct apply equally to conduct that occurs through social media. This includes, but is not limited to, policies relating to discrimination, harassment, retaliation, workplace violence, conflicts of interest, and political activity. Any conflicts or inconsistencies between this policy and any one or more other policies shall be resolved by the county manager or the supervising elected official.
(g)
No expectation of privacy in social media activity.
(1)
County employees and/or volunteers should be aware that social media activity is not secure or private, even if active steps are taken to restrict access. Once information has been posted or exchanged via social media, it is generally trackable, traceable, and accessible indefinitely. For this reason, and consistent with the county's current Information Technology Use Policy, employees and/or volunteers should have no expectation of privacy in any social media activity conducted in the workplace and/or on-duty or in any social media activity which otherwise directly or indirectly relates to or affects the county, any of its departments, or its employees and/or volunteers.
(2)
The county reserves the right to inspect or monitor any social media activity engaged in by its employees and/or volunteers using county owned computers or other electronic equipment or devices. In addition, employees and/or volunteers may be required to provide access to any social media websites or other applications in which they participate upon a determination by the county that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that such access will reveal evidence of a violation of this policy or any other county policy.
(h)
Workplace and/or on-duty usage. Because it recognizes that social media is an emerging form of communication, the county permits employees and/or volunteers to engage in limited social media activity in the workplace and/or while on duty, similar to receiving a personal text message or a telephone call of limited duration. Employees and/or volunteers choosing to do so, however, are expected and required to use proper judgment and discretion, recognizing that even very brief periods of social media activity can collectively amount to significant periods of time. Supervisors are authorized to restrict or prohibit workplace/on-duty social media activity, as appropriate.
(i)
