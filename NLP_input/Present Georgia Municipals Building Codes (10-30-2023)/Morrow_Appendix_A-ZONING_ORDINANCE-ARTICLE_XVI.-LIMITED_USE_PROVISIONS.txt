ARTICLE XVI. - LIMITED USE PROVISIONS

Section 1601 - Limited use procedure.
Within the City of Morrow there exist areas that are transitional in nature with respect to land use. Within these areas specific uses not otherwise permitted in an existing zoning district, but which are consistent with the pattern of development occurring, may be permitted for a limited period of time by the mayor and city council.
The planning and zoning board shall receive applications for limited use permits. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan and explanation of the purpose of the proposed use. The planning and zoning board shall consider the application and make recommendations to the mayor and city council. If approved by the mayor and city council, any one, but only one of the uses allowed either as a permitted or conditional use in the following districts shall be permitted in the zoning district in which the limited use is requested:
•
BG General Business District
•
LM Light Manufacturing District
•
HM Heavy Manufacturing District
Limited uses of an industrial nature will not be permitted in any residential district.
The planning and zoning board shall hold a public hearing on all applications for limited use under this article, which hearing shall be noticed and held in accordance with the provisions of Section 1701 for zoning amendments. At the conclusion of public hearing, the planning and zoning board shall make its recommendation to the city council which shall take up the matter at its next regular meeting and make a final determination.
Should the limited use approved by the city council not be instituted within 12 months of the date of council decision authorizing such use, then the mayor and city council may notice and hold a public hearing on reversion of the limited use provision to the immediately preceding zoning classification without allowance for that limited use.
