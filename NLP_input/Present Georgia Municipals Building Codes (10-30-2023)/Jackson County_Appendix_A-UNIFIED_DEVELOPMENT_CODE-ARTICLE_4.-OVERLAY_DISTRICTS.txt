DIVISION II. - JACKSON COUNTY AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 411. - Findings, purpose and intent.
(a)
Findings. The Board of Commissioners of Jackson County finds that certain hazards to air navigation, as defined, in effect reduce the size of the area available for landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of Jackson County Airport and the public investment therein. The creation or establishment of a hazard to air navigation, as defined, is a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the Jackson County Airport. It is necessary in the interest of public health, public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of hazards to air navigation, as defined, be prevented. The prevention of hazards to air navigation, as defined, should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of police power without compensation. It is also in the public interest to require the marking and lighting of existing hazards to air navigation, as defined.
(b)
Purpose. This division regulates and restricts the heights of constructed structures and objects of natural growth, creates appropriate airport zones, establishes the boundaries thereof and provides for changes in the restrictions and boundaries of such zones via a variance process, and creates a permitting process for uses within said airport zones.
(c)
Intentions. It is the intent of the board of commissioners to protect the airspace above and around Jackson County Airport from objects that pose an obstruction or hazard to air navigation at Jackson County Airport. This overlay district is intended to be established to meet the requirements of United States Code of Federal Regulations, title 14: Aeronautics and Space, chapter I—Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, subchapter E—Airspace, part 77—Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of the Navigable Airspace (hereafter, "Part 77"), including but not limited to subpart C—Standards for Determining Obstructions to Air Navigation.
(Ord. No. 17-003 , § 1, 10-2-2017)
Sec. 412. - Boundaries.
The boundaries of the airport overlay district are shown on the official zoning map or on a separate map thereof. This airport overlay district establishes multiple surfaces following part 77 regulations. The overlay district boundary does not represent or illustrate all of the various airport zones (imaginary surfaces) established in this division.
(Ord. No. 17-003 , § 1, 10-2-2017)
Sec. 413. - Definitions.
Airport: Jackson County Airport (see illustration).
Airport elevation: The highest point of an airports usable landing area measured in feet from sea level. For purposes of this division, the airport elevation is 950.6 feet mean sea level.
Approach surface: A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each end of each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface and it expands uniformly to a width of: 1,250 feet for that end of a utility runway with only visual approaches; 1,500 feet for that end of a runway other than a utility runway with only visual approaches; 2,000 feet for that end of a utility runway with a non-precision instrument approach; 3,500 feet for that end of a non-precision instrument runway other than utility, having visibility minimums greater that three-fourths of a statute mile; 4,000 feet for that end of a non-precision instrument runway, other than utility, having a non-precision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths statute mile; and 16,000 feet for precision instrument runways. The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of: 5,000 feet at a slope of 20 to one for all utility and visual runways; 10,000 feet at a slope of 34 to one for all non-precision instrument runways other than utility; and 10,000 feet at a slope of 50 to one with an additional 40,000 feet at a slope of 40 to one for all precision instrument runways. The outer width of an approach surface to an end of a runway will be that width prescribed for the most precise approach existing or planned for that runway end.
Conical surface: A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to one for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
Departure end of runway: The end of the runway that is opposite the landing threshold. It is sometimes referred to as the stop end of runway.
Departure surface: A trapezoidal shape that begins at the end of the takeoff distance available (TODA) and extends along the extended runway centerline and with a slope, starting at the elevation of the end of the TODA, of one unit vertically for every 40 units horizontally. Departure surfaces, when clear, allow pilots to follow standard departure procedures.
Hazard to air navigation: An obstruction determined to have a substantial adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace.
Height: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all airport zones set forth in this division, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
Heliport primary surface: The area of the primary surface coincides in size and shape with the designated takeoff and landing area of a heliport. This surface is a horizontal plane at the elevation of the established heliport elevation.
Horizontal surface: A horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of a specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is:
(1)
Five thousand feet for all runways designated as utility or visual;
(2)
Ten thousand feet for all other runways.
The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest determined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000-foot arcs, the 5,000-foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal surface.
Instrument departure runway: A runway identified by the airport operator, through the appropriate FAA airports office, to the FAA regional airspace procedures team intended primarily for instrument departures.
Larger than utility runway: A runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of greater than 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and jet-powered aircraft.
Nonconforming use: Any pre-existing structure, object of natural growth, or use of land which is inconsistent with the provisions of this division or an amendment thereto.
Non-precision instrument runway: A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in non-precision instrument approach procedure has been approved, or planned, and for which no precision approach facilities are planned, or indicated on an FAA planning document or military service military airport planning document.
Obstruction: Any structure, growth, or other object, including a mobile object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth in this division.
Part 77: United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14: Aeronautics and Space, chapter I—Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, subchapter E—Airspace, part 77—Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of the Navigable Airspace.
Precision instrument runway: A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an Instrument Landing System (ILS), or a Precision Approach Radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated by an FAA-approved airport layout plan; a military service approved military airport layout plan; any other FAA planning document, or military service military airport planning document.
Primary surface: A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; but when the runway has no specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. The width of the primary surface is: 250 feet for utility runways having only visual approaches; and 500 feet for utility runways having non-precision instrument approaches. For other than utility runways, the width is: 500 feet for visual runways having only visual approaches; 500 feet for non-precision instrument runways having visibility minimums greater than three-fourths statute mile; 1,000 feet for a non-precision instrument runway having a non-precision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways. The width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in this section for the most precise approach existing or planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.
Runway: A defined area of an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length.
Structure: An object, including a mobile object, constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks, earth formations and overhead transmission lines.
Transitional surface: These surfaces extend outward and upward at right (90-degree) angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven to one (seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically) from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right (90-degree) angles to the runway centerline or centerline extended.
Tree: Any object of natural growth.
Utility runway: A runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and less.
Visual runway: A runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures, with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA-approved airport layout plan, a military service approved military airport layout plan, or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority.
(Ord. No. 17-003 , § 1, 10-2-2017)
Sec. 414. - Exemption.
The requirements of this division shall not apply to the construction or maintenance of any structure, or object to a height up to 75 feet above the surface of the land.
(Ord. No. 17-003 , § 1, 10-2-2017)
Sec. 415. - Applicability.
Unless exempted by section 414 of this division, the regulations in this division shall apply to the following:
(a)
Any object of natural growth, terrain, or permanent or temporary construction or alteration, including equipment or materials used and any permanent or temporary apparatus; and
(b)
The alteration of any permanent or temporary existing structure by a change in its height, including appurtenances, or lateral dimensions, including equipment or material used therein.
(Ord. No. 17-003 , § 1, 10-2-2017)
Sec. 416. - Obstructions.
(a)
Any object of greater height than any of the heights or surfaces (airport zones) established by this overlay district is hereby declared to be an obstruction to air navigation at Jackson County Airport.
(b)
Objects that are considered obstructions under the standards described in title 14 CFR part 77, subpart C—Standards for Determining Obstructions to Air Navigation, as applied to Jackson County Airport per this overlay district, are presumed hazards to air navigation unless further aeronautical study concludes that the object is not a hazard. Once further aeronautical study has been initiated, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will use the standards in subpart C—Standards for Determining Obstructions to Air Navigation of part 77, along with FAA policy and guidance material, to determine if the object is a hazard to air navigation. Such standards are used to determine obstructions to air navigation, and they establish the process for aeronautical studies of obstructions to air navigation or navigational facilities to determine the effect on the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace.
(Ord. No. 17-003 , § 1, 10-2-2017)
Sec. 417. - Uses, structures and objects regulated.
Unless exempted by section 414 of this division, within the boundaries of this overlay district, no land shall be used and no structure or object including trees shall be erected or otherwise established, unless said use or structure, tree or object complies with the requirements of this division.

Sec. 418. - Airport zones established.
For purposes of regulating height of buildings, structures and objects, the following airport zones are established for Jackson County Airport within the boundaries of the airport height overlay district. The zones are civil airport imaginary surfaces established under § 77.19 of part 77. In order to carry out the provisions of this division, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to Jackson County Airport. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The following civil airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the airport and to each runway. The size of each such imaginary surface is based on the category of each runway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The slope and dimensions of the approach surface applied to each end of a runway are determined by the most precise approach procedure existing or planned for that runway end. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
