Definitions are found in section 68-201 of this chapter.
( Ord. of 12-21-2020 )
Sec. 68-902. - Findings.
(a)
The county's population and the surrounding areas of the county have grown substantially in the past decade. The result is that the major thoroughfares of the county have experienced a drastic and dramatic increase in the volume of traffic along with significant increases in automobile collisions. The regulations in this article are designed to promote the public health and safety by controlling number, placement, size and height of signs to prevent excessive and undue distraction to motorists and pedestrians and to prevent traffic hazards.
(b)
The county is an attractive and pleasant community with a rural atmosphere where various and diverse businesses have located. The county recognizes the need of these businesses to advertise products and services. The county also finds that it is in the best interests of all property owners, residents and businesses to avoid an environment that encourages visual blight and seek to encourage an attractive suburban environment. As a result, the county must balance the needs of business against the county's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values and enhance public safety.
(c)
The county further finds that uniform regulation of signage providing directional, commercial and noncommercial information to the motoring public to promote public safety is essential. Regulation of the location, size, placement and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities in the county without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the county in the event of police, fire or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.
( Ord. of 12-21-2020 )
Sec. 68-903. - Intent and purpose.
(a)
Accordingly, it is the intention of the county to establish regulations governing the display of signs that will:
(1)
Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare;
(2)
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the county by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs;
(3)
Restrict signs and lights that increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision;
(4)
Promote signs that are compatible with their surroundings.
(b)
It is also the purpose of this article to ensure proper maintenance for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.
(c)
Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of signs and similar devices.
(d)
Permit the reasonable dissemination of all forms of speech.
(e)
To guard against an excess of large, intense signs which cause visual blight on the appearance of the county. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the county for residents, businesses, pedestrians and persons in vehicles.
(f)
Protect the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification.
(g)
Promote economic development.
(h)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs.
(i)
Ensure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community.
(j)
Encourage signs that are well designed and compatible with their surroundings and with the buildings to which they are appurtenant and encourage signs that are integrated with and harmonious to the buildings and sites they occupy.
(k)
Eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays.
(l)
Recognize that the size of signs that provide adequate identification in pedestrian-oriented business areas differs from those that are necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where traffic is heavy, travel speeds are greater and required setbacks are greater than in pedestrian areas.
(m)
Preserve and improve the appearance of the county as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade.
(n)
Encourage creative and well-designed signs that contribute in a positive way to the county's visual environment, express local character and help develop a distinctive image for the county and to discourage mediocre and poorly-designed signs.
(o)
Encourage new and replacement signage that is appropriately sized in its context so as to be easily readable.
(p)
Encourage the construction, alteration and repair of signs according to accepted and approved standards.
(q)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(r)
Further the objectives of the county's comprehensive plan and this chapter.

k.
All signs shall appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light level changes so that brightness of the display does not cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. The failure of an electronically-changed sign to appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this section.
l.
No malfunction of a changing sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Any such condition resulting from a malfunction shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this section.

No general advertising sign employing changing sign technology which is permitted by state law to be located on or adjacent to a state highway system or a general advertising sign with a changing message sign face that is visible from a state highway shall be located within a 5,000 feet radius of another general advertising sign employing changing sign technology that is permitted adjacent to a state highway and on the same side of said state highway or any other general advertising sign with a changing message sign face that is visible to traffic traveling in the same direction on said state highway.

n.
No general advertising sign employing changing sign technology which is adjacent to an arterial or connector street or with a message face that is visible from an arterial or connector street shall be located within 2,500 feet radius of another general advertising sign employing changing sign technology that is visible to traffic traveling in the same direction on said arterial or connector street, as measured in a straight line from the nearest edges of the signs.

q.
Permit applications for electronically-changed signs must also include a certification from the owner or operator of the sign stating that the sign shall at all times be operated in accordance with this part and that the owner or operator shall provide proof of such conformance upon request of the county. Whether the sign is programmed from the site or from a remote location, the computer interface or other method that programs or controls the changing of the sign copy shall be available for inspection upon the request of the county so that the county can determine the messages being displayed. If the information from the computer interface or other control method is not immediately available, the sign shall cease operation until such access can be provided.
r.
Any general advertising sign which applies to employ changing sign technology shall be required to include as a part of its application a statement which shall indicate that the applicant is willing to allow law enforcement agencies to utilize its display capabilities to disseminate emergency messages on a temporary basis.
s.
Due to the limitation on distances between certain electronic changing signs, an approved application to employ changing sign technology must be acted upon within the time frames stated on the sign permit. After expiration of the permit, a new application for the location shall be required and the expired permit shall be not considered to bar location of other changing signs due to distance requirements under this part. The county may issue one extension of 60 days for good cause as shown in writing by the permit holder prior to the expiration of the original permit.
