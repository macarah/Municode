Specimen trees are trees which warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. Specimen trees may be designated for preservation because of rarity, aesthetic value, historical value, botanical importance, importance to overall community planning or size. The size or condition of trees will be evaluated by the city arborist to determine if they qualify as specimen trees, based upon the following criteria:
(1)
Size.
a.
Large and medium species trees.
1.
Oaks and magnolia species, 14 inches DBH or larger.
2.
Long leaf and spruce pine, ten inches DBH or larger.
3.
All other confers (pines), 20 inches DBH or larger.
4.
All other species, 18 inches DBH or larger.
b.
Small species trees. Six inches DBH or larger.
(2)
Condition. All trees must be relatively sound and have a solid trunk, with no major insect or pathological problems. Trees which face imminent death within two years, based upon the judgment of the city arborist, may be disqualified as specimen trees.
(Code 1976, § 9-4005(A); Ord. No. 2000-43, § 9-4005(C), 7-6-2000)
Sec. 62-92. - Preservation of specimen and canopy trees.
Preservation of specimen and canopy trees shall be given special consideration in the preparation of site development plans. It is the desire of the city to preserve all existing trees wherever possible in development. Preserved specimen and canopy trees may be used in minimum landscape or buffer requirements.
(Code 1976, § 9-4005(B); Ord. No. 2000-43, § 9-4005(C), 7-6-2000)
Sec. 62-93. - Removal and replacement.
(a)
Where application is made for removal of a specimen tree, a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted and approved by the city arborist or director of inspections or their designee.
(b)
The replacement of specimen softwood species (pines) shall be on a one-for-one basis. Each specimen pine removed must be replaced with one tree having a minimum 2.5-inch basal caliper. The replacement of all other specimen trees shall be equivalent to 25 percent of the total diameter of the removed trees with a minimum of 2.5-inch basal caliper. Small specimen trees shall be replaced with a minimum of 2.0-inch basal caliper.
(c)
Replacement trees may be planted on-site if the site can accommodate trees above the required minimum specifications. If replacement trees cannot be planted on-site, the canopy and specimen trees will be valued and funds placed in the tree bank established under section 62-3, at the rate of $100.00 per diameter inch. Funds in the tree bank shall be used to install trees on public property, entrances to the city or other approved property. All projects shall be approved by the city tree commission.
(d)
If a specimen tree is preserved, a two-for-one credit shall be provided for new plantings. The root zone area for each preserved tree shall be equal to two trees.
(e)
Where payment to the tree bank is required under subsection (c) of this section, the developer may plant trees larger than the minimum requirement and shall be entitled to a credit of $100.00 per inch above the minimum inch requirements.
(f)
Removal of specimen trees from property not being currently developed also requires the replacement of 25 percent of caliper inches on the same property or public property with a minimum of 2.5-inch basal caliper trees. All removed trees that cannot be planted on-site will be valued and funds placed in the tree bank at the rate of $100.00 per diameter inch.
(g)
Specimen trees must be replaced by the same species or a species having the potential for comparable size, quality and longevity.
(h)
No specimen tree or canopy tree which overhangs any public right-of-way shall be removed without first obtaining a tree removal permit.
