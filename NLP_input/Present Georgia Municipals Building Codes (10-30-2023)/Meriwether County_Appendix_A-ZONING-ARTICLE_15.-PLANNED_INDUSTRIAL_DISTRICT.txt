ARTICLE 15. - PLANNED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 15.0. - Purpose.
The purpose and intent of the planned industrial district regulations are to provide for a comprehensively planned district for the orderly growth and development of certain industrial uses which are, by virtue of controls, mutually harmonious with other industries permitted in said planned industrial district and also harmonious with residential, commercial, and other uses permitted in nearby districts. The planned industrial district caters to basic industries requiring large tracts of land; it is intended to be protected from encroachment by commercial, residential, and other land uses adverse to the location and expansion of industrial development. The planned industrial district regulations are intended to promote the health, safety, morals, welfare, comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants of this district and the surrounding lands. Within a planned industrial district as shown on the official zoning map of Meriwether County, Georgia, the following regulations shall apply.
