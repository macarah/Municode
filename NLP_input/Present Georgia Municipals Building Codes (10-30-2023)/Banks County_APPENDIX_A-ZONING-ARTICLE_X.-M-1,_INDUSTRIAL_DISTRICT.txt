Sec. 1001. - Purpose and intent.
1.
The M-1 industrial district is established with the purpose of reserving certain areas with relatively level topography, adequate water and sewage facilities, and access to arterial streets for industrial operations, but where such areas' proximity to residential and other districts makes it desirable to limit industrial operations to those that are not objectionable by reason of the emission of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, gas, fumes, odors, or other nuisances, or radiation or other environmental hazards, and that do not create fire or explosion hazards or other objectionable conditions. Uses within this district should not require substantial quantities of water for manufacturing operations and should not necessarily require rail, air and water transportation. No uses which pose risks of ground or surface water contamination, air pollution or other environmental hazards should be permitted. Certain commercial uses having an open storage characteristic, or which are most appropriately located as neighbors of industrial uses, are also included within this district. All outdoor storage yards within the M-1 District, shall be surrounded by an opaque vegetative buffer or opaque fence buffer.
2.
To qualify acreage for rezoning to M-1, there shall be a minimum of two acres in the tract for consideration.

12.
Landfills
A.
Landfills are classified into three types: 1) Inert waste landfills, 2) Construction and demolition landfills, and 3) Solid waste landfills. Hazardous waste landfills are prohibited and hazardous waste (as defined by the Department of Natural Resources) may not be disposed of in an inert, construction/demolition, or solid waste landfill. Except for hazardous waste landfills which are prohibited, each type of landfill is a conditional use within the M-1 District and is subject to the following:
(1)
All landfills must be surrounded by a buffer at least 800 feet wide, located on the landfill property. At least 200 feet of the buffer shall be sufficient in its undisturbed state, or supplemented as necessary by an opaque vegetative buffer or opaque fence buffer, to completely obscure viewing of any landfill cell at all times of the year. To be sufficiently vegetated, vegetation must include evergreen species that reach a minimum height of 20 feet when mature. If plantings are required, the planting plan shall be submitted to and approved by the zoning administrative officer.
(2)
The boundary of the landfill property (either inside or outside the vegetated buffer) must be surrounded by a fence or wall, with the owner of the property maintaining and repairing the fence or wall.
(3)
No landfill cell may exceed the height limitations as established by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division.
(4)
No land disturbing activity or depositing of debris within 300 feet of any wetland, groundwater recharge area, floodplain, creek, stream, river, pond, lake or other body of water.
(5)
No landfill cell may be located within 1,000 feet of an existing dwelling unit.
(6)
All lights at a landfill shall be downward firing and shielded.
(7)
Hours of operation for receiving waste at any landfill shall be no greater than 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Saturday. Waste shall not be received on Sunday.
(8)
A landfill shall only be permitted where all county roads used for access have been built to a standard sufficient to withstand the projected number of trips per day at maximum weight for the vehicles expected. If a landfill is proposed adjacent to county roads that are not sufficient, according to the county engineer, to withstand the loads, or were not designed for such loads, the landfill owner may pay to bring such roads up to standard from the entrance(s) of the landfill to the nearest county or state road of sufficient strength; or the landfill shall be denied. Truck traffic shall be restricted to roads of sufficient design and construction standards.
B.
An application for a conditional use permit for a landfill shall also submit the following information, in addition to other conditional use requirements:
(1)
Site plan prepared, and sealed by a qualified engineer depicting:
(a)
The zoning on all adjacent parcels.
(b)
The location of the landfill cells, all buffers and fences.
(c)
The location of all dwelling units within 1,500 feet of any proposed landfill cell.
(d)
Topographic information highlighting land sloping 25 percent or more.
(e)
All floodplains, streams and rivers, watershed areas, wetlands, and groundwater recharge areas within ½ mile of the subject property and on the subject property, as well as showing the location of the landfill and the landfill cells to those features showing all buffers and setbacks.
(f)
All water wells within one mile of the landfill cells.
(g)
Any other information as may be required by the zoning administrative officer.
(h)
Certification by a qualified engineer that the landfill is in compliance with all local, state and federal regulations.
(i)
Proximity to state or national historic sites within five miles shall be indicated.
(j)
A report from a geologist of the soil conditions on the proposed landfill site, discussing the topography (especially any steep slopes), the substrata, and any geologic hazards or relevant conditions on the property, as well as giving an opinion as to the property's suitability for the type landfill proposed.
(k)
A plan showing access, ingress and egress, including mechanisms to keep dust down and dirt off county roads. All access roads to landfill cells must be paved, and a truck cleaning station must be used at any exit. Entrances shall be located to minimize traffic hazards, with accel/decel lanes provided. The traffic plan shall also state the estimated number of trips per day, the vehicle types, and maximum weight of vehicles expected.
13.
Manufacturing, processing and assembling, repair and servicing of commodities or products.
14.
Television, land mobile, communication, microwave, and radio transmission antennae and towers, including studios or offices, provided the height of such towers and antennae do not exceed 150 feet without specific authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Communications Commission. All towers and antennae must be set back a distance equal to the full height of the tower from all property lines. The applicant at the time of filing the application shall provide a site plan and information regarding topography, coverage zone and tower height. Accessory structures shall be limited to usages associated with the operation of the antennae or towers and shall be appropriate in scale and intensity. All towers and antennae not used to transmit signals or communications for a period of 12 consecutive months shall be removed from the property where the towers and antennae are located.
