Previously vaccinated dogs and cats whose rabies vaccination has lapsed from more than 30 days are considered unvaccinated and will be treated as such.

(3)
Livestock exposed to rabies. Vaccinated livestock (vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian with a USDA approved vaccine for that species at least 30 days prior to the attack) bitten by a rabid animal should be re-vaccinated immediately, confined, and observed for 45 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by Mitchell County Health Department.
