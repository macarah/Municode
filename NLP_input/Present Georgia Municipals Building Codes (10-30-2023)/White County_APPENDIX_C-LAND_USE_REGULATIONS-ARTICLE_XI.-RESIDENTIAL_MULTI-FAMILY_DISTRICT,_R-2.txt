ARTICLE XI. - RESIDENTIAL MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT, R-2

Section 1100. - Purpose and intent.
The Residential Multi-Family District is intended to provide suitable areas for the development of a variety of multi-family dwelling types at medium to high densities, up to 16 units per acre. The intent of this district is to locate in area or in close proximity to where public water and public waste water treatment services are available and adequate access to the state highway and county major arterial transportation network. The location of this district is more compatible with higher densities and access to commercial facilities and community services. Developments within this district should also look to provide non-motorized alternatives to motorized transportation to access adjacent commercial facilities and community services.
Manufactured and mobile home parks for rental purposes only are allowed within this district at a density of one unit per acre and shall follow the requirements in the White County Code for manufactured mobile home parks.
This district also includes uses that require a special use permit (SUP) from the White County Commission. Uses requiring special use permits are those that would not be appropriate without restrictions and is not permitted by right or conditionally, but allowed through regulations as to the number, area, location, relation to neighborhoods, operations or other pertinent considerations and specification/criteria as specified in this Code.
