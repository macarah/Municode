Editor's note— Ord. No. 29-03, adopted August 7, 2003, set out provisions intended for use as § 16-59. For purposes of numerical order, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as 16-58.
Sec. 16-59. - Disability.
Disability: A physical or mental condition which totally and presumably permanently prevents a participant from engaging in any substantially gainful employment and which entitles the participant to receipt of a Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit under the Social Security Act; provided, however, if a participant is not covered by Social Security, either through the employer or through any other employer, the pension board shall determine the participant's disability in accordance with the provisions of the following:
(1)
Whenever such a participant not covered by Social Security files an application for a disability retirement pension with the pension board, the participant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed practicing physician of Georgia certifying to the disability of such participant. Promptly thereafter the pension board shall order the participant to be examined by a physician to be named by the board who likewise shall certify the physical ability or disability of the participant. The pension board shall pay for the fees and expenses of such physician. In the event the certificates of the respective physicians generally agree upon disability, such facts shall be conclusive as to the physical condition of the participant and the pension board shall grant a disability retirement pension in accordance with Section 4.4 of the Plan Document for the City of Cartersville Pension Plan. In the event the certificates of the aforesaid physicians disagree as to whether the participant is disabled, then under these circumstances that question shall be submitted to a third physician selected by the pension board. The medical opinion of the third physician, after examination of the participant and consultation with the other two (2) physicians, shall decide such question. The participant and the pension board shall share the fees and expenses of the third physician equally.
(2)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no participant shall qualify for a disability retirement pension if the pension board determines that the participant's disability results from (i) self-addiction to alcohol or narcotics, (ii) an injury suffered while engaged in a felonious or criminal act or enterprise or (iii) service in the Armed Forces of the United States which entitles the participant to a veteran's disability pension; but this provision shall not prevent the participant from qualifying for a pension under another provision of the plan.
(3)
The pension board may adopt such rules as it deems necessary to administer the provisions of this section and such rules shall be applied uniformly and consistently to all participants in similar circumstances.
(Ord. No. 11-04, 2-19-04)
Sec. 16-60. - Disability retirement.
(a)
Disability retirement: A participant shall be eligible for a disability retirement pension if their employment is terminated prior to their normal retirement date by reason of disability after they are vested in the pension plan. Payment of a disability retirement pension shall commence as of the first day of the month following the date the participant terminates employment due to disability, as long as the following conditions are met.
(1)
Employee's medical condition occurred or became symptomatic during the time they were employed in an employee/employer relationship with the employer (City of Cartersville);
(2)
Employee was totally and permanently disabled at the time they terminated employment; and
(3)
Employee has not been employed with any other employer after such termination.
(b)
The pension board shall have the right at intervals of not less than one (1) year, prior to a participant's normal retirement date, to require proof of continuing disability, such as to require the participant to submit proof of receipt of Social Security Disability Benefits or, in absence of that, to require an examination of any participant receiving a disability retirement pension; provided, however, for purposes of this section, a participant's normal retirement date shall be no earlier than their sixty-fifth (65 th ) birthday with ten (10) years of vesting service; or fifty-fifth (55 th ) birthday with twenty-five (25) years of vesting service; or fiftieth (50 th ) birthday with twenty (20) years of vesting service for police and fire personnel. In the event such participant is found not to be suffering from a disability, the pension board shall, after hearing evidence thereon and giving the participant opportunity to be heard, discontinue such participant's disability retirement pension. In the event such participant receiving a disability retirement pension refuses to submit to a physical examination after thirty (30) days notice to report for such examination or to supply proof, of continuing disability, the pension board shall discontinue payments of the disability retirement pension until the participant submits to such examination or supplies such proof, and the participant shall be deemed to have forfeited their pension during the time of refusal. Following certification that a participant's disability has ceased, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Such participant shall not be prevented from qualifying for a pension under another provision of the plan based only upon their vesting service, benefit accrual service and compensation prior to their disability retirement; and
(2)
Any such participant shall not receive vested service or benefit accrual service for their period of disability and any pension payments received during their disability period shall be disregarded.
(c)
Workers' compensation benefits: Further notwithstanding any other provisions of the Cartersville Pension Plan, if at the time of retirement a participant is receiving payments under the provisions of the Georgia Workers' Compensation Law which are being paid at the expense of the city, the amount of pension payable under the plan shall be reduced by the amount being received as workers' compensation. This reduction shall continue as long as the retired participant is receiving workers' compensation, and upon discontinuance of workers' compensation payments, the offset shall be eliminated and the retired participant shall be entitled to receive sums as calculated under the terms of the pension plan. No such reduction shall operate to reduce the sums payable under the provisions of the Cartersville Pension Plan below two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month.
(d)
The cost of providing a disability retirement option shall be paid by the city, in lieu of providing long-term disability insurance coverage for employees vested in the pension plan.
(e)
Effective on September 1, 2003, all City of Cartersville personnel that are vested in the Cartersville Pension Plan have the option to apply for disability retirement if they meet the above guidelines.
