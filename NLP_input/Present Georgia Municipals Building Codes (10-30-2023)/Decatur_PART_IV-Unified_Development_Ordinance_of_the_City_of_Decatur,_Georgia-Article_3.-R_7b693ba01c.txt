  Sec. 3.8. - Conservation Subdivision (R-85, R-60)
_____

3.8.1. - Description
This Section provides for conservation subdivisions in the R-85 and R-60 zoning districts.
3.8.2. - Purpose
A.
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure.
B.
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
C.
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
D.
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
E.
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
F.
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
G.
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
H.
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
I.
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
J.
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
K.
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
L.
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
3.8.3. - General Regulations
A.
Applicability
This conservation subdivision option is available in the R-85 and R-60 zoning districts. Applicants shall comply with all other provisions of the Unified Development Ordinance and all other applicable laws. Approval of a conservation subdivision is also subject to the requirements of Sec. 11.2.5.
B.
Ownership of Development Site
The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
C.
Housing Density Determination
The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator:
1.
Calculation
The maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a site is calculated by multiplying the net site area by the maximum number of units per acre allowed in the district. Where a conservation subdivision is proposed, the net site area must be reduced to exclude all of the following areas:
a.
Slopes over 15% of at least 2,500 square feet contiguous area;
b.
The 100-year floodplain or regulatory floodplain, whichever is higher;
c.
Bodies of open water over 2,500 square feet contiguous area;
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act; or,
e.
Anticipated right-of-way needs for roads and utilities.
2.
Yield Plan
The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The proposed plan must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
3.8.4. - Application Requirements
A.
Site Analysis Map Required
Concurrent with the submission of a site concept plan, the applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed open space will meet the requirements of this Section. The preliminary site plan shall included the following features:
1.
Property boundaries;
2.
All streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features;
3.
Topographic contours of no less than 10-foot intervals;
4.
All primary and secondary conservation areas labeled by type, as described in Sec. 3.8.5.;
5.
General vegetation characteristics;
6.
General soil types;
7.
The planned location of protected open space;
8.
Existing roads and structures; and
9.
Potential connections with existing greenspace and trails.
B.
Open Space Management Plan
An open space management plan, as described in Sec. 3.8.5.E., shall be prepared and submitted prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit.
C.
Instrument of Permanent Protection
An instrument of permanent protection, such as a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant and as described in Sec. 3.8.5.F., shall be placed on the open space concurrent with the issuance of a land disturbance permit in a form acceptable to the UDO Administrator.

Open space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument.
B.
Standards to Determine Open Space
1.
The minimum restricted open space shall comprise at least 40% of the gross tract area.
2.
The following are considered primary conservation areas and are required to be included within the open space, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this Section:
a.
The 100-year floodplain or the regulatory floodplain, whichever is higher, in accordance with Sec. 9.5., Floodplain Management/Flood Damage Prevention;
b.
Buffer zones of at least 75 feet width along all perennial and intermittent streams in accordance with Sec. 9.2., Stream Buffer Protection;
c.
Slopes above 15% of at least 2,500 square feet contiguous area;
d.
Wetlands that meet the definition used by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act;
e.
Populations of endangered or threatened species, or habitat for such species; and,
f.
Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds.
3.
The following are considered secondary conservation areas and should be included within the open space to the maximum extent feasible:
a.
Important historic sites;
b.
Existing healthy, native forests of at least one acre contiguous area;
c.
Individual existing healthy trees greater than 8 inches caliper, as measured from their outermost drip line;
d.
Other significant natural features and scenic view sheds such as ridge lines, peaks and rock outcroppings, particularly those that can be seen from public roads;
e.
Prime agricultural lands of at least 5 acres contiguous area; and
f.

4.
Above-ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface may be included within the protected open space but cannot be counted towards the 40% minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and documented existing trails may be counted). Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space.
5.
At least 75% of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract. The open space should adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, other protected areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected open space.
6.
The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space.
C.
