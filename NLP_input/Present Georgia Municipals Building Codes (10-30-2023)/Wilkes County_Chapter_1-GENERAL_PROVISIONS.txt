Chapter 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 1-1. - Designation and citation of Code.
The ordinances embraced in the following chapters and sections shall constitute and be designated "The Code of Wilkes County, Georgia," and may be so cited. This Code may also be cited as the "Wilkes County Code."
State Law reference— Codification requirements, O.C.G.A. § 36-80-19.
Sec. 1-2. - Definitions and rules of construction.
The following definitions and rules shall apply to all ordinances of the board of commissioners, unless the context requires otherwise:
Generally. The ordinary signification shall be applied to all words, except words of art, or words connected with a particular trade or subject matter, when they shall have the signification attached to them by experts in such trade, or with reference to such subject matter. In all interpolations, the courts shall look diligently for the intention of the county commission, keeping in view, at all times, the old law, the evil and the remedy. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and a transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands. While subpart A is a codification of general ordinances and subpart B is a codification of ordinances pertaining to land development, provisions in subpart A may also apply to land development and provisions in subpart B may also apply to activities other than land development. The failure to include in subpart B provisions that relate to land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions. The inclusion in subpart B of provisions that relate to activities other than land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions.
Liberal construction; minimum requirements; overlapping provisions. All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this Code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the board of commissioners may be fully carried out. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the other provisions of this Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling.
