(1)
The existing land use pattern;

The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, utilities, and streets;
(4)
The cost of the county and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and other public safety measures;
(5)
The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quantity;

The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight;

It will not be required that the board of commissioners consider every criteria contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare.
(c)
If the board of commissioners determine from the evidence presented that the applicant has shown that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals and general welfare under the standards of review, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable provisions as may be imposed by board of commissioners as provided in this chapter. Otherwise, such application shall be denied.

Prior to notification by the planning director of any reversion of approval, the owner of the property in question may petition the board of commissioners for a modification or extension of land use or conditional use approval.
