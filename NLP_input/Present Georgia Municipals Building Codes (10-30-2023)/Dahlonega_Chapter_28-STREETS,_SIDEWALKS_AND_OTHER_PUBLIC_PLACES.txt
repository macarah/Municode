(3)
Whether the event involves the preparation and sale of food;
(4)
The duration of the event; and
(5)
Whether the event involves transportation or installation of heavy equipment, or the installation of a stage or other temporary structures.
Provided however, that, in deciding whether insurance will be required or waived for an event the city manager or his designee shall not consider the number of anticipated onlookers, the potential risk of property damage or bodily injury that may be caused by onlookers, nor the possibility that the event will be controversial in nature.

It strengthens the city's ability to anticipate and provide adequate services for the multiple filming projects throughout the city. It also enhances the city's ability to accommodate unanticipated circumstances and requested changes. The NGFO similarly will respond to the needs of the city's neighborhoods regarding entertainment industry work and will promote community awareness of the entertainment industry's impact upon the city's economic development.

While permits are required for entertainment industry work that occurs on public property only, the North Georgia Film Office will be a resource and liaison for all entertainment industry work, including work that occurs on private property.

The NGFO shall make reasonable efforts to consult with the other applicant in an attempt to find alternative times and/or locations that are acceptable.
(3)
There is no deadline by which a filming permit application must be submitted to the NGFO; however, where a filming permit application includes a request for limiting public access to public parking or a street closure, this portion of the application will not be approved unless it is received at least five business days prior to the closure.
(4)
The NGFO and the departments of purview shall compile and maintain rules and guidelines applicable to the use of public property for filming, including the elements that are part of the filming, and shall apply those rules and guidelines equally regardless of the subject matter of the filming and/or the content of the speech therein.

(6)
The NGFO may deny an application only if the director reasonably determines that one or more of the below-listed conditions exists. Prior to denial, the NGFO shall make reasonable efforts to consult with the producer in an attempt to resolve issues of concern and/or find alternative ways to accommodate the producer's filming needs, as described in subsections (7), (8), (9) and (10) of this section.

(7)
Prior to denying an application, if the NGFO determines that the requested filming includes one or more of the conditions described in subsection (6) of this section, the NGFO shall employ reasonable efforts to identify alternative filming locations, times and/or dates that eliminate the unacceptable condition and that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city. The producer shall modify the application to incorporate any agreed-upon alternatives.
(8)
Prior to denying an application, if the NGFO determines that the requested filming or related activity creates a violation as described in subsection (6) of this section, the NGFO shall allow the producer to revise the application so that the filming activities comply with applicable law.
(9)
Prior to denying an application pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, the NGFO shall notify the producer of the potential denial and allow him to remedy the conditions described in said subsections.

(10)
Prior to denying an application pursuant to subsections (7), (8), (9) and/or (10) of this section, the NGFO shall provide the applicant an opportunity to present documents or other evidence that refutes the director's finding of previous permit violations, of previous violations of the law, or of misrepresentation or misinformation on the application, as applicable.
(11)
Where the director has complied with subsections (7), (8), (9) and/or (10) of this section and reasonably determines that one or more of the conditions set forth in subsection (6) of this section continues to exist and that the application should therefore be denied, the director shall issue a written communication to the applicant that includes a detailed explanation for the denial. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the director from also notifying the applicant orally.
(12)
If the director denies an application, the applicant shall have the right to appeal the decision to the city manager or his designee, provided that a written request for such appeal is made to the city manager within three business days after the applicant's receipt of the director's determination. The person considering the appeal must be impartial, and must have had no involvement in the director's decision.

(a)
After receiving a permit, the producer may request a material modification of the permit at any time by submitting to the NGFO a change request and change fee as set forth in this article. The NGFO's ability to process the change request shall be determined pursuant to the provisions established for processing applications as set forth in section 28-174(2) and (3). The director's decision of whether to grant or deny the modification request shall be determined as set forth above. Submission of a change request will not impact the validity of the permit already issued, except upon written request of the producer.
(b)
Where a producer has obtained a permit and abides by the material requirements thereof, the permit shall prevent the city's stoppage of activities that are authorized by the permit, except as otherwise set forth in subsection (c) of this section or as a result of applicable law.
(c)
In the event that the county sheriff's office, county fire department and/or other city department of purview identifies a substantial public health or safety risk arising from or caused by the filming, and the producer is in material compliance with the permit, the following shall occur:
(1)
Where the substantial risk is identified prior to the commencement of the filming, the director and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue. Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview.
(2)
Where the substantial risk is not imminent and is identified after the commencement of the filming, the director and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue. Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview.
(3)
Where the substantial risk is imminent as reasonably determined by the department of purview and is identified after the commencement of filming, said department may place a stop work order on the filming if it finds that the order will likely alleviate the substantial risk. The stop work order may be issued without advance notice where the department of purview deems that a delay of the order will jeopardize public health and safety, and shall be lifted as quickly as possible after the risk is eliminated. The department of purview shall notify the director of the stop work order within two hours of its issuance. The director and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, that will minimize the length and impact of the stop work order as decided by the producer, and that remedy the health/safety issue as determined by the department of purview.
(4)
Changes made to the permit pursuant to this subsection (c) shall not require payment of a change fee.
(d)
Where the director, or a department of purview in consultation with the director, determines that the producer is violating a material term of the permit, the director shall decide the appropriate remedial actions after consulting with the department of purview and the producer. If the director and/or department of purview finds that a substantial public health or safety risk is arising from or caused by the material violation, the department of purview in consultation with the director may place an immediate stop work order on the filming without prior notice to the producer, and consultation with the producer shall occur after the work stoppage. The consultation between the director, department of purview and producer shall evaluate the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional, whether permit modifications should be made, whether the stop work order should be lifted (where applicable), and what other actions should be taken (if any). Where the violation creates a substantial public health and/or safety risk, the remedial actions decided by the director will not be deemed final until the department of purview reviews the remedial actions and confirms that they will eliminate the health and safety risks.

(1)
The name, legal status (i.e., partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration shall include the name, street address, email address, if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner.
(2)
The name, street address, email address, if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative.

Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from obtaining permits required by city ordinances nor from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before using the facilities of others, including the city. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from notifying the city of construction as required herein.
(e)
Facilities in place without registration. Beginning one year after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.
