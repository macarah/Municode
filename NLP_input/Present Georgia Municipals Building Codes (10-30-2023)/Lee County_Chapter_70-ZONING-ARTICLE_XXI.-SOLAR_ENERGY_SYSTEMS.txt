Sec. 70-692. - General requirements for all ground mounted solar energy systems.
The following requirements apply to all ground mounted SES facilities, in addition to the specific requirements in this article which apply specifically to intermediate and large scale SESs respectively.
(1)
Solar access. Consistent with O.C.G.A. § 44-9-20 et seq., a property owner may obtain a solar easement from another property owner for the purpose of ensuring a ground mounted SES adequate exposure to sunlight.
(2)
Impervious surface. Ground mounted structures and components of the ground mounted SES facility, including transformers and foundations, shall be considered impervious. However, for purposes of compliance with the Lee County zoning code's impervious surface coverage requirements, the panels of a ground mounted SES shall be considered pervious if they maintain sheet flow and allow for water to infiltrate under and around them through a pervious surface and into the subsoil. With respect to the location of solar panels on the land surface, the following shall apply:
a.
Arrangement of solar panels on mild slopes (less than ten percent) is encouraged. If the ground slope is steeper than five percent, adding level spreaders in the ground at each dripline will slow the movement of water and maintain sheet flow.
b.
Use structures/foundations for the solar energy system that occupy minimal space (no more than five percent of total site area).
c.
Include a sufficient distance between rows of panels to allow for capture of rainfall and growth of vegetation beneath and between. This disconnection distance between rows of panels should be greater than the width of a single solar panel.
d.
Limit the lowest vertical clearance of the panels to no greater than 10 feet to avoid erosion at the dripline.
(3)
Lighting. To reduce light pollution, lighting of a ground mounted SES facility shall:
a.
Be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for its safe operation:
b.
Be directed downward where reasonably feasible;
c.
Incorporate full cut-off fixtures; and
d.
Reasonably utilize motion sensors.
(4)
Tree removal. The removal of trees or natural vegetation for a ground mounted SES shall be avoided to the extent reasonably practicable and such removal shall comply with the requirements of the Lee County zoning code.
(5)
Decommissioning. Unless otherwise approved by the Lee County Board of Commissioners, decommissioning shall begin no later than 12 months (365 calendar days) after a ground mounted SES has ceased to generate electricity or thermal energy and shall be finally completed no later than 12 months (365 calendar days) after commencement of such decommissioning. Such decommissioning shall be undertaken and completed by the owner or operator of the SES facility at the time of such decommissioning. Such decommissioning shall be accomplished in accord with the following:
a.
For a ground mounted SES facility allowed with a permit, the SES facility shall be decommissioned in accordance with the most recent decommissioning plan approved by the Lee County Board of Commissioners, and as further described below and in chapter 70, article 70-697(2)f. related to decommissioning:
b.
All sizes of ground mounted SES facilities shall be removed from the premises, and such removal shall include, but shall not be limited to, all materials installed or associated with the facilities, including above ground and below ground materials, and such removed materials shall be either deposited in an appropriate public licensed landfill site recycled or otherwise reused in another facility
c.
The real property where the SES facility was located shall be returned to its substantially original condition which existed at the time of approval of the construction of the SES facility by Lee County.
d.
For SES facility sites which were forested sites at the time of approval of the construction of the SES facility by Lee County the replanting of the solar site after decommissioning with the same number and species of trees shall be accomplished during the decommissioning process. Replanting with non-native trees or only planting with one type does not capture the same habitat and carbon sink gains that the site originally produced, and is not authorized.
e.
A decommissioning plan shall be submitted with each application for the location and construction of an SES facility and must be approved by the Lee County Board of Commissioners as part of the SES facility approval process.
f.
In order to facilitate the decommissioning process, and notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the owner or operator of a proposed SES facility shall submit to Lee County pictures, including aerial photographs (including Google Maps' aerial photographs) of the proposed SES facility site as part of the application process for approval and permitting of a SES facility.

(a)
Upon receiving a conditional use application for an SES, the Lee County shall conduct permitting proceedings in accordance with the requirements of the Lee County zoning code (chapter 70, article III, section 70-89).
(b)
Conditional uses shall be initially reviewed by the planning commission and a recommendation regarding approval or denial of such conditional use application shall be made to the Lee County Board of Commissioners based on criteria located in chapter 70, article III, section 70-89.
(c)
With respect to the approval or denial of a conditional use application under this section, both the Lee County Planning Commission and the Lee County Board of Commissioners shall consider the following with respect to each conditional use application:
(1)
Whether the proposed SES facility can coexist with healthy tree coverage within the area where the proposed SES facility is to be located;
(2)
Whether the SES facility will negatively affect the ecological benefits of forestland with respect to the forestland's continuing ability to maintain their clean water filtration capacity, soil erosion control, clean air, wildlife habitat, aesthetics and recreation potential is substantial. With respect to such analysis, the following should be considered with respect to such potentially impacted forestland;
(3)
Whether the proposed SES site will avoid clear cutting forests entirely; and
(4)
If a solar energy system is proposed on forestland, the footprint or design (a) avoids the healthiest sections of forest and oldest trees, and (b) adopts habitat corridors to protect wildlife.
(5)
Whether the proposed plan establishes that a policy of zero net loss should be followed, meaning both planting the same number of trees that were cut elsewhere.
(6)
Whether the proposed SES facility shall be physically positioned in such a way that glare does not affect adjacent properties or roadways.
(7)
Whether the proposed SES facility complies with required setbacks, visual buffers and signage requirements.
(8)
Whether the proposed SES application provides long-term plans to minimize stormwater runoff and soil erosion impacts from the SES facility through the following site design practices:
(9)
Whether the proposed SES application provides for the avoidance of soil compaction underneath and around panels during and after construction by using low impact construction techniques.
(10)
Whether the proposed SES application provides for maintaining natural soil and vegetative groundcover in good condition underneath the panels, rather than cement, gravel or bare dirt. Such vegetative groundcover should include: (i) a meadow condition with native grasses are low growing, low maintenance, and have deeper roots which help decrease soil compaction; (ii) planting pollinator friendly habitat (native plant species, such as shrubs, grasses, and wildflowers) between, below, and alongside solar panels, thus, helping restore pollinator population through dual land uses.
(11)
Whether the proposed SES application provides for avoiding chemical fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides, as this can pollute stormwater runoff and may require stormwater treatment, and requiring mowing of the grass areas.
(12)
Whether the proposed site for the SES facility is suitable, taking into consideration impacts to soils, particularly as to prime farmland and farmland of statewide significance, the applicant's efforts to locate the proposed facility away from prime agricultural land, the sites accessibility to electric transmission infrastructure at the site and generally in the county, any special rationale offered by the applicant for location decisions that may be related to watershed management and aquifers, the applicant's proposed use of equipment (including types of equipment) and site preparation practices designed to minimize soil disturbances, and the applicant's proposals regarding maintaining compatible mixes of uses at the proposed facility site.
(13)
Whether the proposed site for the SES facility contains prime farmland or farmland of statewide significance which would likely be negatively impacted by the construction and operation of such an SES facility;
(14)
Whether the conversion of the proposed site for the construction and operation of an SES facility results in the removal of economic opportunities for agriculture-related businesses doing business in Lee County and surrounding counties;
(15)
Whether the use of the proposed land for the construction and operation of the proposed SES facility is compatible with existing adjacent land uses;
(16)
Whether the proposed solar facility will likely have an adverse or negative effect upon the fair market value of real property, including, but not limited to, residential, commercial, or agricultural real property, in the geographic area within a radius often ten miles of where the solar facility is to be located;
(17)
A conditional use application may be denied if the Lee County Board of Commissioners determines the proposed SES facility does not meet the requirements of the Lee County zoning code, including, but not limited to, this article of the Lee County Code of Ordinances; provided, however, that a conditional use application which does not comply with one or more of the requirements of this section may be approved by the board of commissioners with or without the recommendation of the planning commission if the board of commissioners finds that the requirements of this section not complied with are not applicable to the particular application or that the failure to comply with particular requirements of this section can be excused due to special conditions existing with respect to the real property upon which the SES is proposed to be located.
In the event that the conditional use application is denied, then the applicant may file an appeal in the same manner and under the same terms and conditions as appeals in other zoning cases in Lee County are filed and prosecuted. In the event that the conditional use application is approved, the county shall issue the applicant a written permit for the construction and operation of the SES within ten calendar days of the approval of the conditional use application by the Lee County Board of Commissioners. The construction and operation of the SES facility by the owner shall be undertaken at all times in accord with the Lee County Code of Ordinances, including, but not limited to, this article.
