Sec. 22.5-1. - Purposes.
This chapter is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Toccoa, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Toccoa as a proactive city in the availability of wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this chapter shall:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities to serve the residents and businesses of the city;
(2)
Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas;
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunications tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
(7)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5-2. - Definitions.
As used in this chapter, terms shall have the meanings indicated in the City of Toccoa Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 24 of this Code.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)

(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5-5. - Preferred location sites.
(a)
Publicly used structures: Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches.
(b)
Co-location sites: Any existing site on which a legal wireless telecommunications facility is currently located shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this ordinance and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the planning department of the city or the city commission authority to be visually obtrusive.
(c)
Industrial and commercial structures: Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications system.
(d)
Mixed use buildings in planned development districts: Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other non-residential space) are also preferred location sites.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5-6. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
(a)
General requirements for all telecommunications facilities: The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this chapter.
(1)
Building codes and safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities that are published by the FCC as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the city planning department.
(2)
Regulatory compliance: All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this chapter shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
(3)
Security: All telecommunications facilities shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. This requirement may be waived by the city planning department if it is deemed that this would produce negative visual clutter or obstruct a view corridor.
(4)
Lighting: No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless part of a approved public lighting program or required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the director may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(5)
Advertising: No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities.
(6)
Visual impact:
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall, subject to applicable standards of the FAA or other federal or state agencies, be maintained with a galvanized metal finish, painted a neutral color, or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. Telecommunications facilities located in residentially zoned areas shall be painted in a neutral color or textured to match the existing environment to minimize visual obtrusiveness. If federal or state regulations require, telecommunication facilities shall maintain a galvanized steel finish or other required finish.
b.
Concealment requirements such as pine tree, cactus, parapet extension, silo, fake chimney, water tower, extended wall inside existing pylon sign, fiberglass flag pole, and existing steeple should be ordered and may be ordered by the city.
c.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower and is generally visible to the public, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers, or other background.
d.
Antennas mounted on architecturally significant structures or significant architectural details of the building shall be covered by appropriate casings, which are manufactured to match existing architectural features found on the building.
e.
Where feasible, antennas can be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
f.
Towers or roof mounted antennas shall not be placed in direct line with significant view corridors, as designated by the city or by any state or federal law or agency. For purposes of this ordinance a significant view corridor shall be defined as an area to be kept free of obstructions or structures which interfere with the view of any scenic area, or historic building or area. A view corridor may be established by ordinance of the city, by zoning restrictions adopted in accordance with the ordinances of the city, or by any state or federal law or agency in accordance with provisions of federal laws or duly adopted regulations.
g.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters shall be screened from public view and may use landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding structures. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(7)
Landscaping:
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The planning commission may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the planning commission.
8.
Maintenance impacts: Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. Access drives and maintenance vehicle parking shall be paved unless the requirement is waived by the planning commission.
(9)
Principal, accessory and joint uses:
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower.
b.
Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same build able area. Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals.
(10)
Lot size and setbacks:
a.
The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to:
1.
Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required;
2.
Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; and
3.
Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 22.5-7.
(11)
The proposed project must not disrupt the overall community character. For purposes of this ordinance, the term overall community character shall be determined by applying the criteria set forth in Chapter 24, Zoning.
(b)
Additional requirements for towers:
(1)
Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Wireless communication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical (i.e. camouflaging through integration with structures or appearance such as artificial trees, etc.).
(2)
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
(3)
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. (i.e. artificial tree appearance, steeples, decorative fencing, etc.)
(4)
Towers greater than 70 feet in height shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable as determined by the Planning Department of the City of Toccoa through a variance request.
(5)
When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height.
(6)
Towers shall not be sited where they will create visual clutter or negatively affect specific view corridors as designated by the City of Toccoa or any state or federal law or agency.
(7)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided requirement number (b)(4) above is met along with all setback, design and landscape requirements as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5-7. - Application procedures.
(a)
Special use permits:
(1)
A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the planning department and handled in accordance with the special use permit provision of Article 19 of the City of Toccoa Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 24 of this Code]. The applicant may obtain a special use permit pursuant to the City of Toccoa Zoning Ordinance provided that all of the requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied and further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties.
(2)
In granting a special use permit, the city commission of Toccoa may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties.
(b)

(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5-11. - Removal of antennas and towers.
All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the director or his designee any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the minimum Standard Building Code or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal or seek costs incurred through court action. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the minimum Standard Building Code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5.12. - Abandoned towers.
(a)
Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal or seek costs incurred through court action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
(b)
If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this ordinance as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5-13. - Pre-existing towers/non-conforming use.
(a)
All telecommunications facilities operative on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a non-conforming use and shall be treated as a non-conforming use in accordance of the city. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. The planning department may approve the addition of 20 feet to any existing tower whereby it can be shown that this would provide for co-location and eliminate the need for a new tower and it is determined that adequate site area exists for the location of any equipment buildings. Approval of an additional 20 feet applies to all zoning districts, however, additions greater than feet shall require a special use permit.
(b)
A telecommunications facility that has received city approval in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired.
(c)
Placement of an antenna on a non-conforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the non-conforming structure.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
Sec. 22.5-14. - Coordination with federal law.
Whenever the city commission finds that the application of this ordinance would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a special use permit waiving any or all of the provisions of this chapter may be granted.
(Ord. of 11-23-09, § I)
