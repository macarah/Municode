Chapter 77 - STANDARDS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES

Sec. 77-1. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for the siting of all wireless communications towers and antennas which will encourage the development of wireless communications while protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public and maintaining the aesthetic integrity of the community. The goals of this chapter are as follows:
(a)
To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impact of telecommunication towers, antenna support structures and wireless communications facilities;
(b)
To minimize the total number of towers and antennas within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of Berkeley Lake;
(c)
To locate telecommunications towers and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized;
(d)
To encourage the design and construction of towers and antennas to minimize adverse visual impacts;
(e)
To avoid potential damage to property caused by wireless communications facilities by insuring that such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or when determined to be structurally unsound;
(f)
To avoid and preserve those areas of significant scenic merit;
(g)
To promote and encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites among service providers;
(h)
To enhance the ability of the providers of wireless communications services to deliver such services to the community effectively and efficiently.

Sec. 77-2. - Definitions.
Accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure.
Alternative tower structure means man-made structures resembling trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that, in the opinion of the city clerk, are compatible with the natural setting and surrounding structures, and effectively camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers.
Antenna means any exterior transmitting or receiving devices mounted on a tower, building or structure and used in communications that radiate or capture electromagnetic waves, digital signals, analog signals, radio, wireless telecommunications signals or other communications signals. Such definition does not include for purposes of this article, radar antennas, amateur radio antennas, satellite earth stations, MMDS antennas, television receiving antennas and direct broadcast satellite dishes.
Co-location means the placement of antennas of two or more service providers on the same tower or alternative tower structure.
Height when referring to a tower or other structure means distance measured from the finished grade of the parcel to the highest point on the tower or other structure, including the base pad and any antenna. If the base pad or support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average between the highest and lowest grades shall be used in calculating height.
Microcell means a wireless communication facility comprised of antennas extending no more than four feet above the structure to which it is attached, and with an area no larger than 576 square inches (e.g. 3′ × 1½′) panel antenna or a two-foot diameter parabolic antenna as viewed from any one point.
Preexisting towers and preexisting antennas mean any tower or antenna for which a building permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, including permitted towers or antennas that have not yet been constructed so long as such approval is current and not expired.
Scenic views mean geographic areas in Berkeley Lake which have been included in any nature preserve or scenic preservation efforts; or have sufficient scenic merit as determined by council so as to require preservation. A scenic view may be from a stationary viewpoint or be seen as one travels along a roadway or path.
Tower means any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supported monopole towers, common-carrier towers, and cellular telephone or PCS towers.
Wireless transmission facilities means the buildings, cabinets, equipment and property, including but not limited to, generating and switching stations, repeaters, cables, wires, conduits, ducts, pedestals, antennas, towers, alternative tower structures, electronics and other appurtenances used to transmit, receive, distribute, provide or offer low-power mobile voice transmission, data transmission or other wireless communications by linking a wireless network or radio wave transmitting device through a series of short range, contiguous cells that are part of an evolving cell grid.
(Ord. No. O-99-09, 6-18-2009)
Sec. 77-3. - Applicability.
All new towers and antennas shall be subject to the regulations contained within this chapter except as provided in subsections (1) through (3), inclusive:
(1)
Public property. Nothing in this article shall be read to prohibit a government owned tower from being located at a specific site when the tower is required to protect the public welfare or safety.
(2)
Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This chapter shall not govern any amateur radio tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
(3)
Pre-existing towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be required to meet the provisions of this chapter, other than the requirements of section 77-10. Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this chapter as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting antennas." However, in the event a preexisting tower or antenna ceases to function, then the subject tower, antenna and related equipment shall be removed from the subject property within 90 days at the facility owner's expense.
(Ord. No. O-99-09, 6-18-2009)
Sec. 77-4. - Permitted uses.
(a)
Upon approval by the planning and zoning commission and receipt of an appropriate building permit, freestanding communication towers may be located in the Light Industrial (M-1) and Neighborhood Business (C-1) zoning districts; provided, however, such towers shall satisfy all of the conditions of this chapter.
(b)
Upon approval by the planning and zoning commission and receipt of an appropriate building permit, rooftop mounted communications towers and antennas may be located on any nonresidential building and alternative tower structure in the city so long as:
(1)
Antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop maintain a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact;
(2)
Such tower or antenna is set back from any existing or proposed off-site residence and separated from any residentially zoned property at least a distance equal to two times the full height of the tower and antenna, but in no event less than 100 feet.
(3)
The existing free-standing nonresidential structure other than a tower on which such tower or antenna will be placed is 50 feet in height or greater and the tower or antenna will add no more than 20 feet total to the height of said existing structure;
(4)
No advertising or writing is permitted on an antenna or tower;
(5)
No signs or illumination are permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the planning and zoning commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views; and
(6)
The number and location of antennas, communication towers or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure is not excessive and does not adversely affect properties and views.
(c)
Prohibitions.
(1)
No new tower may be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new tower is to serve.

(Ord. No. O-99-09, 6-18-2009)
Sec. 77-5. - General requirements.
(a)
Application for construction/placement. An application shall be required for the construction or placement of all new wireless transmission facilities and new co-location facilities, antennas or towers within the city limits. Each application shall include plans, specifications and fees as required by this chapter.
(b)
Structural integrity. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every two years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the city clerk. The owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense.
(c)
Regulatory compliance. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such communications towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted to the city clerk every 12 months.
(d)
Ownership. Tower owners shall register ownership annually with the city and ownership changes with the city within 30 days of any change.
(e)
Letter of intent for use. The tower owner must file with the city a letter of intent for use every 24 months and provide the city with a copy of any notice to the FCC of intent to cease operations within 60 days of the date planned to cease.
(f)
Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by visually pleasing, decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the planning and zoning commission may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. Chain-linked fencing is not permitted.
(g)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on any antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the planning and zoning commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the lease disturbance.
(h)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities.
(i)
Visual impact. Proposed facilities shall be designed to avoid having an undue aesthetic impact on prominent ridgelines, Greenspace conservation areas, adjacent residential areas and shall not unreasonably interfere with the view from any public park, natural scenic vista, Lake Berkeley, or major view corridor. Height and mass of facilities shall not exceed that which is essential for the intended use and public safety. The planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to impose conditions consistent with the purpose of this section in approving a proposed facility. Furthermore, the planning and zoning commission may designate an alternative location for the tower to be evaluated by the applicant if it is determined that the proposed location would result in undue adverse aesthetic impacts. In consideration of this, the applicant may revise its application to include such a site, assuming it is available to the applicant and reasonably technically feasible to meet the applicant's communication objectives.
(1)
In order to protect public safety and to preserve the scenic character and appearance of the area, the height limit for towers, antennas and tower-related fixtures shall be not more than 20 feet above the average height of the tree line measured within 100 feet of the highest vertical element of the telecommunications facility. Notwithstanding the above, additional height may be approved upon a finding by the planning and zoning commission that the additional height is necessary in order to provide adequate coverage in the City of Berkeley Lake or to accomplish collocation of facilities and that the additional height will not cause an undue visual impact on the scenic character or appearance of the area.
(2)
Towers, antennas and any necessary support structures shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color camouflaging and architectural treatments use of stealth design, including those which imitate natural features, is encouraged and may be required in visually sensitive locations.
(3)
Any tower applicant that is not proposing a camouflaged tower must provide a detailed explanation why they are not proposing a camouflaged tower. Explanation must discuss items other than economics.
(4)
Non-camouflaged towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(5)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(6)
Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar design and scale.
(7)
Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower.
(j)
Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows:
(1)
Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials, which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. Landscaped strips shall satisfy the minimum design and planting requirements for buffers established in Article VII, "Buffers, Landscape and Tree Regulations".
(2)
All existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent practical. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing trees to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
(3)
In lieu of these standards, the planning and zoning commission may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above.
(k)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
(1)
Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made.
(2)
Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be the greater of 100 percent of the breakpoint or 25 feet for a monopole, lattice or guy tower. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site.
(3)
Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals.
(l)
Setbacks and separation.
(1)
Towers must be setback from adjoining property lines a minimum distance equal to the tower height, including antennas and other vertical appurtenances.
(2)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setbacks, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(3)
All guy wires and above-ground accessory facilities associated with the communication tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required by the underlying zoning district where the tower is to be located.
(4)
The planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to reduce or waive any required setback upon the request of the applicant if the tower or support structure will be less visible as a result of the diminished setback. The planning and zoning commission must also find that the reduction or waiver of the setback is consistent with the purposes and intent of this chapter. The structure must still meet the underlying setback requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
