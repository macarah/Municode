(a)
Upon receipt of an application from the Department of Business Development, the Sheriff of Macon-Bibb County shall review all applications for the issuance, transfer, or renewal of any license under this Chapter, and shall make a recommendation, in writing, to the Macon-Bibb County Commission. In making this review, the Sheriff shall be authorized to consider any information from any source regarding the applicant, any owner, the agent, or the location for which a license is sought. The Sheriff's review shall not be required to include independently verifying the information provided by an applicant on an application. The Sheriff's recommendation shall indicate whether the Sheriff recommends granting, denying, or granting with conditions the license application in question, and shall include the Sheriff's particular reasons for making such recommendation. Where the Sheriff recommends granting a license with conditions, the recommendation shall include the particular conditions the Sheriff would impose, as well as the particular reasons for imposing such conditions.
(b)
Separate recommendations shall be made for each initial license application, and each license renewal or transfer application, except that the Sheriff may submit as a single bulk item his or her recommendation to approve any or all license renewals which meet the following conditions:
(1)
Each such renewal application was timely submitted, and all renewal fees were timely paid;
(2)
Each such renewal is limited only to licenses presently held by the applicant, and does not seek to add to the categories of licenses held by that applicant; provided, however, that an application seeking to renew some, but fewer than all, categories of licenses currently held under this Chapter may still be included in a bulk recommendation to approve renewal under this paragraph;
(3)
The renewal application does not seek to change the licensee, licensed location, or agent of record under the license;

In the Sheriff's opinion, there have been no material or unfavorable changes in the operations or community impact of each such business applying for renewal since such business's license under this Chapter was last issued or renewed;
(5)
The Sheriff did not perform a review of any such license pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section during the two calendar years preceding the date of the renewal application; and
(6)
In the Sheriff's opinion, each such licensee remains qualified for licensure under this Chapter and is entitled to renewal of all licenses designated in that business's renewal application; provided that, if conditions have previously been imposed on the licensee in lieu of denial or revocation of any license under this Chapter, then it is also the Sheriff's opinion that the conditions imposed are being complied with, and that it is not necessary to impose any further conditions on said licensee.
(c)

(1)
The performance of any act prohibited by this Chapter or the failure to perform any act required by this Chapter as well as the violation of any law, state or federal, relating to the business of the licensee. If such act, omission or violation is done by an agent, servant, employee, or officer of the licensee, the lack of knowledge on the part of the licensee or the lack of authorization for such act or omission or violation shall be no defense;
(2)
The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or the conviction of any licensee, partner, or any officer, director or stockholder of a licensed corporation with respect to a charge of violation of any of the laws of the United States or of the state relating to alcohol control, or any crime, whether a felony or not, involving moral turpitude;
(3)
Any other act or omission with respect to the operation of a business licensed hereunder which the commission or its designee shall find to be contrary to the public interest, or which shall render the licensee, or the business location thereof, unfit for the continued operation of the business;
(4)
A material change in conditions of the premises or the structures or facilities located thereon;
(5)
A material change in the nature or scope of the operations of the licensed business with respect to those activities for which such business is licensed under this Chapter; or
(6)
The occurrence of any event or events during the preceding calendar year, at or within 100 yards of the licensed business, whether related to each other or unrelated, or the commission of any act or acts in any place by the licensee or the business's owners or managers, which, in the aggregate, would cause the Sheriff to materially alter his or her recommendation as to the suitability of such business for the licenses it possesses or the need for conditions to be imposed on such licensee, upon consideration of the following:
a.
Whether any such events constitute a crime under the laws of the United States, the State of Georgia, or the Macon-Bibb County Code of Ordinances;

e.
Any other factors which the Sheriff is charged with reviewing or which the County is authorized to consider as part of an initial license application under this Chapter.
(d)
Upon completing any review under subsection (c) of this Section, the Sheriff should prepare a written report identifying the licensee and all current licenses issued under this Chapter to said licensee for any businesses or locations within Macon-Bibb County; the particular business(es) or location(s) for which the review was performed; the reasons for which a review was initiated; any findings or conclusions made as a result of that review; and stating whether the Sheriff recommends no changes for the licensee, or specifying any Adverse Actions the Sheriff recommends taking against such licensee. Copies of this report shall be sent to the licensee's registered address, as well as to the Department of Business Development Services, the Macon-Bibb County Commission, and the County Attorney. There shall be no limit to the frequency with which the Sheriff shall be authorized to review any particular licensee, provided that no Adverse Actions shall be recommended or taken based on information which was previously disclosed as part of an application by the licensee to obtain, renew, or transfer any license under this Chapter, or as part of any proceedings relating to the consideration thereof.
(e)
If, upon completing any license review under subsection (c) of this Section, the Sheriff makes a determination that the factors considered under subsection (c) create a particular and severe risk of injury or death to any person or to any member of the public at large, then the Sheriff shall have the authority to immediately revoke on a temporary basis all licenses issued under this Chapter to such licensee, for no more than ninety (90) days or until such time as the Macon-Bibb County government reaches a final administrative decision on the determination, whichever occurs first.

Sec. 4-412. - Requests to modify or remove conditions imposed.
(a)
Where any condition is imposed on any licensee under this Chapter in lieu of denying issuance, renewal, or transfer of a license, or in lieu of revoking any license, the licensee shall have no opportunity to challenge or seek removal or modification of the conditions imposed for a period of one year from the later of the date on which the conditions were first imposed or the date on which any appeal affirming the imposition of any or all conditions became final.
(b)
After the expiration of the time period set out in subsection (a), above, any licensee shall be authorized to request in writing that the Sheriff undertake a review as to the ongoing appropriateness of the conditions imposed upon said license. The request shall identify those particular conditions which the licensee would like to have modified or removed, and shall include any information or evidence supporting the licensee's request which the licensee would like the Sheriff to consider. The request shall be submitted to the Department of Business Development Services, which shall promptly forward copies of the same to the Sheriff, the Clerk of the Macon-Bibb County Commission, and the County Attorney.
(c)
Upon receipt of a request to modify or remove any conditions imposed, the Sheriff shall review the site and activities of the licensee in the manner described in Subsection 4-402(c). The Sheriff shall consider all materials submitted by the licensee as part of this review, and shall prepare a written report and recommendation as described in Subsection 4-402(d), including particular recommendations as to each request made by the licensee to modify or remove any conditions previously imposed. In the event that a condition is to be modified, it need not be modified in the manner or to the degree requested by the licensee.
(d)
The Sheriff's review under this Section shall be plenary, and nothing in this Section shall prevent the Sheriff from recommending the imposition of new conditions upon any licensee in lieu of revocation of any licenses, or from recommending the revocation of any license if the Sheriff learns of information during such review which would support any such recommendation; provided that no conditions previously imposed shall be made more restrictive, and no other Adverse Actions shall be taken, based on information which was previously disclosed as part of an application by the licensee to obtain, renew, or transfer any license under this Chapter, or as part of any proceedings relating to the consideration thereof.
(e)
Copies of any review completed under this Section shall be forwarded to the Department of Business Development Services, the Macon-Bibb County Commission, and the County Attorney. Upon receipt by the Macon-Bibb County Commission, further proceedings shall continue as under Subsection 4-403(a), and all subsequent procedures shall be identical to those procedures which apply to recommendations made by the Sheriff pursuant to Section 4-402.
(f)
Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the Sheriff from including any licenses reviewed pursuant to this Section as part of a bulk recommendation for renewal under Subsection 4-402(b), if all requirements for doing so are met.
(g)
No licensee shall have the right to request any modification or removal of conditions imposed while any prior request made under this Section is pending, or for a period of one year after the later of the date upon which a final decision is made on any prior request under this Section or the date on which any appeal affirming an Adverse Action taken as a result of any prior request made under this Section becomes final.
