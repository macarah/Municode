Purpose. To create a method by which citizens may petition the board of commissioners for consideration of capital improvement projects to be funded by the requesting citizens via a special district ad valorem tax or by special assessment.

An interested property owner may petition for the creation of a capital improvement special tax district under this article by filing an application for a preliminary petition with the public works director.
(2)
If the public works director determines that the application for a preliminary petition is complete, the public works director will develop a preliminary cost estimate and provide the applicant with a preliminary petition.

The preliminary petition is a means for the applicant and the public works director to gauge support for the proposed project by the affected property owners. The applicant will have 45 days from the issuance of the preliminary petition to obtain the signatures of at least 75 percent of the owners of the property lying within the proposed capital improvement tax district for further consideration of the proposed project.
(4)
Upon the timely return of a completed preliminary petition, the public works director will determine whether the proposed project will require additional preliminary steps prior to the issuance of the final petition, such as the dedication of private property or the completion of preliminary studies, reports, or plans.
(5)
The applicant will have 45 days from the issuance of the final petition to obtain the signatures of at least 75 percent of the owners of the property lying within the proposed capital improvement tax district.
(6)
The board of commissioners will consider the final petition and exercises its discretion to decide whether to approve the project and how to fund the project.
