2-30-1 - Short Title.
This ordinance shall be known as the "Glynn County Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance."
2-30-2 - Findings and Intent.
(a)
The Glynn County Board of Commissioners finds that there is a need to establish a vacant and foreclosure registry as a mechanism to protect property values in the county for all property owners.
(b)
The Glynn County Board of Commissioners finds that there is a need to establish a vacant and foreclosure registry as a mechanism to protect areas from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are vacant, foreclosed, or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure.
(c)
Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted.
(d)
Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this ordinance.
(e)
This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners to provide Glynn County with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of the Code of Ordinances, Glynn County, Georgia.
(f)
If there is a conflict between the provisions and requirements of this ordinance and state law, as it exists or may be amended hereafter, then state law shall govern.
