(1)
The hearing will be held in the city council room. All persons who wish to address the planning commission or the mayor and council at a hearing shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the hearing body prior to the commencement of the hearing. Any party who wishes to address the mayor and council through his attorney or other designated representative or agent, that party's attorney or other designated representative or agent shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the hearing body prior to the commencement of the hearing setting forth the name of the principal and the capacity in which they are appearing, i.e., whether as attorney, parent, attorney in fact, real estate agent, or otherwise identified.
(2)
The planning commission or the mayor and council will cause to be read the proposed zoning decisions under consideration and any departmental reviews pertaining thereto prior to receiving public input. Proposed zoning decisions shall, as a general rule, be called in the order in which they are received provided nothing shall prevent the mayor and council from changing the order of decisions reviewed at the time of hearing for the convenience of the planning commission or the mayor and council and the public.
(3)
The planning commission or the mayor and council shall call each person who has signed up to speak on the proposed zoning decision in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except for amendments by the applicant, who will always speak first, or if the hearing body is bringing a proposed zoning decision to the hearing, then the hearing body shall speak first; provided, however, no person shall be allowed to speak in addition to his attorney or their designated representative or agent. Each person shall have only one opportunity and time limit in which to speak and said opportunity and time shall be used only by the person or the person's attorney or other designated representative or agent. The purpose of this is to disallow additional time, not allowed to other speakers, by use of attorneys, representatives, and agents, thereby gaining an unfair advantage at the hearing. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself and state his current address, and if an attorney, or other designated representative or agent, identify his principal. Only those persons signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless the mayor and council, in their discretion, vote to make an exception at the time of the hearing, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing.
(4)
The length of time of oral presentations permitted to each speaker will be determined by the mayor and will depend upon the number of persons present and desiring to speak.
(5)
Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed zoning decisions under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the mayor and council. The merits of the proposed zoning decision shall include evidence or opinions regarding devaluation, fair market value, nuisance, environmental concerns, traffic, noise, aesthetics and in general, the health, welfare and benefit of the community or county as they are affected by the proposed zoning decision. The speaker shall refrain from commenting on unrelated zoning issues and unrelated tracts of land. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposal under consideration. The planning commission or the mayor and council may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection.
(6)
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the hearing body from taking reasonable steps necessary to ensure that hearing are conducted in a decorous manner, to assure that the public hearing on a proposed zoning decision is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.
(7)
Prior to the close of the hearing, the planning commission or the mayor and council shall announce whether it will vote on the policies and procedures at that same hearing or whether it will defer its vote for a period not to exceed 30 days.
(l)
