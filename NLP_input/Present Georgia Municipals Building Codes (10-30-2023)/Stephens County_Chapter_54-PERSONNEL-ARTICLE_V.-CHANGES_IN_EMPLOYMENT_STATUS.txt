ARTICLE V. - CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT STATUS

Sec. 54-71. - Transfers.
A transfer is the movement of an employee from one position to another position with the same job classification, with the same salary range and a similar level of responsibility. The county may initiate a transfer, or an employee may request a transfer. If a position is open at an equivalent pay grade, an employee may request transfer to that position. If the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for that job are not the same as for the present job, the employee will be tested and interviewed for the new position. The county may transfer an employee to any position, at any pay grade, if the employee meets the minimum qualifications of the new position and the salary is not changed.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § E-1)
Sec. 54-72. - Promotions.
A promotion is the movement of an employee from one position to another position with a higher job classification, a higher salary range, and a higher level of responsibility. The county encourages the training, development, and promotion of its employees. As standard practice, every attempt will be made to fill promotional vacancies from within the county's work force, if qualified applicants are employed by the county and such action would not conflict with the county's anti-discrimination or fair employment practices. However, promotional vacancies may be filled with external applicants at the discretion of county management.
No employee may be promoted unless the employee has completed their probation period. To be considered for a promotion, an employee should submit application in response to a posted or published job vacancy notice. Promotion is contingent upon meeting the minimum qualifications of training and experience for the higher position. The employee will undergo interviewing and any testing required for the position. Department managers may also consider any applicants from outside the county's work force.
When an employee is promoted to a position in a higher pay grade, the employee's pay rate will increase in accordance with the county's position classification and pay plan; if no formal pay plan is currently in effect, the employee will be paid a salary determined appropriate by the county. The promoted employee will be required to serve a probation period in the new position.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § E-2)
Sec. 54-73. - Demotions.
A demotion is the movement of an employee from one position to another position with a lower job classification, a lower salary range and a lesser degree of responsibility. A demotion may be made as a disciplinary action or on a voluntary or involuntary basis, provided the employee meets the qualifications for the position to which the employee is being demoted.
An employee serving an initial probation period may be demoted for any reason or without reason. An employee serving a promotional probation period may be demoted to their previous position for any reason or without reason.
A regular or probation period employee may request a demotion for personal or other reasons; such action will constitute a voluntary demotion.
In the event of an involuntary demotion or a disciplinary demotion of a regular employee, the employee has the right to appeal the action. The county administrator will notify the employee in writing of the right to appeal as provided in this handbook [chapter].
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § E-3)
Sec. 54-74. - Resignation.
A resignation is the voluntary separation of an employee from Stephens County through submittal of a notice that they wish to resign the position.
To resign in good standing, an employee should submit notice of resignation at least two weeks in advance of the date of resignation (or 30 days in advance, for management personnel). This notice should be submitted in writing to the department head, and the department head will notify the county commissioners of the resignation. Failure to comply with this guideline will be entered as such in the personnel records, and may negatively impact the employee's eligibility for re-employment. The county administrator of county commissioners may exempt an employee who has given less than required notice if, in their judgment, exceptional circumstances warrant such exemption. Also, under certain circumstances, the county administrator or county commissioners may choose not to accept an employee's resignation, and may instead choose to dismiss the employee.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § E-4)
Sec. 54-75. - Dismissal.
A dismissal is a termination of employment for cause. An employee may be dismissed for committing any act contrary to county policies or for failure to demonstrate competent and consistent performance of duties. Although progressive discipline procedures will generally be followed, progressive discipline will not be applied for situations which justify immediate termination of employment. The county reserves the right to omit one or more progressive steps depending on the situation and the facts involved, and to exercise appropriate actions on a case-by-case basis. Employees who are dismissed, or terminated for just cause, are not eligible for rehire.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § E-5)
Sec. 54-76. - Job abandonment.
An employee who is absent from work for three consecutive days without having received leave approval or without having called in to report the absence will be considered as having voluntarily abandoned/terminated their job without proper notice. Such a separation will be recorded as "not in good standing", and may affect the receipt of accrued benefits. The effective date of termination of an employee due to job abandonment will be the last day the employee worked.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § E-6)
Sec. 54-77. - Layoff or reduction in force.
A layoff or reduction in force may be necessary when a position or group of positions must be closed due to circumstances beyond control of the employer or the employee. Typical reasons for layoff include lack of work, shortage of funds, organizational changes, material changes in duties, or other reasons not related to the employee's conduct and not reflecting dissatisfaction with the employee's service. The order in which employees are laid off will be determined by county needs and priorities, and the department heads will file a written listing of employees to be laid off with the county administrator prior to taking any action. The duties previously performed by a laid-off employee may be reassigned to other employees holding positions in appropriate classes.
Employees released due to a reduction in force will have no right to grieve their release. When a regular status employee is scheduled to be laid off, the employee may be offered a transfer to a job of equal or lower grade, if the job is available and the employee is qualified.
At the county's discretion, employees separated due to reduction in force may receive preference in rehiring if a position for which they are qualified should open within that year. Such employees will retain the right to consideration for reinstatement to their prior position or another position at the same level and for which they are qualified, if such a position becomes available, for a period of one year from the separation date. Offers of reemployment of previously released employees will be based on past job performance and seniority. Refusal by a released employee to accept a position offered for reinstatement nullifies that employee's right to further consideration for employment.
(Ord. of 5-26-2009, § E-1)
Sec. 54-78. - Other separations.
Other actions resulting in termination of employment include the following:
(1)
Separation during probation period. At any time during a probation period, an employee may be separated from their position by the county, without notice, and without the right of appeal or hearing.
(2)
Retirement. An employee may voluntarily leave employment with the county when they have met the requirements governing retirement. Employees leaving due to retirement are typically considered to have separated employment in good standing.
(3)
Disability. An employee may be dismissed if they cannot perform the essential duties of the job with reasonable accommodation, and there is no available vacancy for which the employee is qualified and with duties, which the employee can perform with reasonable accommodation. Separation action will only be taken after all accrued leaves with pay have been extended, and will be always taken by the end of one year from the date the employee last reported for work.
(4)
Death. In the event of the death of an employee, separation will be considered effective as of the date of death. Compensation and benefits due as of that date will be paid to the designated beneficiary, except as otherwise required by law.
