(b)
Grease interceptor maintenance, recordkeeping, and grease removal. Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by this division and as directed by the superintendent or his designee. Grease interceptors shall be installed at the user's expense, when such user operates a restaurant, convenience store with kitchen facilities or cooking establishment selling and/or serving prepared foods. Grease interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments when they are deemed necessary by the health officer or superintendent for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease. No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject grease interceptor to exceed 325 milligrams per liter, as identified by method EPA Method 1664, or 275 milligrams per liter, as identified by EPA method 413. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design, and capacity approved by the superintendent or his designee and shall be readily and easily accessible for user cleaning and city inspection. All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every 60 days. Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor shall:
(1)
Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent and effluent baffles with 20 percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a "sludge pocket."
(2)
Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required, but at intervals of not longer than 60 days at the user's expense. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor.
(3)
Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated in any fashion onsite and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after said onsite treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment of established grease numerical limit described in this subsection (b) on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor into the city sanitary sewer collection and treatment system.
(4)
Operate the grease interceptor in a manner to maintain said device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved. The term "consistent" means any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in this subsection (b). If an establishment desires, because of documented space constraints, an alternate to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request for an alternative location shall contain the following information:
a.
Location of city sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building.
b.
Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all services at that site.
(5)
Understand and agree that the use of biological additives as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the health officer or superintendent. Any establishment using this method of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the trap's outlet, is consistently achieved.
(6)
Understand and agree that the use of automatic grease removal systems is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the health officer or superintendent, the building inspector of the city and the county department of health. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is consistently achieved.

Sec. 38-404. - Rates; billing.
(a)
Rates for residential service customers and commercial service customers shall be as established from time to time by the mayor and council. A current schedule of rates shall be kept on file in the offices of the city clerk and the city gas superintendent.
(b)
Each individual industrial firm service customer and each individual interruptible service customer shall be sold natural gas on a contract separately negotiated between the city and the customer. Each individual industrial transportation customer shall be supplied natural gas on a contract separately negotiated between the city and the customer. In the absence of a valid executed contract currently in effect, the industrial firm service customer, the interruptible service customer and/or the industrial transportation customer will be charged the city's applicable rate for a commercial service customer (non-residential firm service).
(c)
Each customer will be classified and placed into a rate structure that is appropriate for the intended use and that will enable the customer to buy gas at the most advantageous price to the customer.
(d)
The city's retail gas rates shall be increased or decreased pursuant to the recommendation of the city's gas supplier/marketer based on the incremental increase or decrease in the wholesale rates for natural gas charged by the city's natural gas supplier.
(e)
The effective date of the rate increase or decrease shall be the first billing cycle subsequent to the effective date of the change by the gas supplier.
(f)
The application of this purchased gas adjustment (PGA) shall be to the nearest whole cent per MCF (thousand cubic feet).
(g)
All of the city's natural gas rates shall be subject to this adjustment with the exception of the rates for service to customers whose rates already contain a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) by contract.
(h)
Any customer who desires to have his service temporarily disconnected will be charged no fee for turning natural gas off, but a reconnection fee as fixed from time to time by the mayor and council will be charged for turning the natural gas back on. This standard applies under all conditions except where a new natural gas line is installed and a customer is being served natural gas for the first time.
(i)
Meters shall be read and bills to customers for natural gas service shall be mailed out on the last day of the month in which service was provided and the amount due as shown by said bill shall be payable by the 15th day of the following month, and if not paid by the 15th day of the following month a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the bill shall be added thereto and collected. If the amount of the bill, including the penalty, is not then paid by the 25th day of the following month, the natural gas service shall, without any further grace period, be disconnected, provided natural gas service shall not be terminated until the customer is issued a written notice and has an opportunity to be heard concerning the delinquent account. If the customer's bill is not paid when due and service is disconnected, no charge shall be made for such disconnection, and the deposit so made shall be used and applied against the amount owed by the customer and the balance of the deposit, if any, shall be returned to the customer. The full amount of any deposit held by the city will be returned to the customer only in the event natural gas service is disconnected and the customer's bill has been paid in full. Should such customer thereafter wish to be reconnected to the gas system the deposit hereinabove provided for will be required before reconnection and in addition a reconnection charge as fixed from time to time by the mayor and council shall be collected.

(c)
All services installed shall be installed in accordance with the standard specifications of the City of Wrens Operations and Maintenance Procedures Manual or other applicable regulations.
(d)
Any customer receiving natural gas service will be required to pay such charge as fixed from time to time by the mayor and council for the installation of a high pressure regulator set. From the downstream connection of the high pressure regulator set, the customer will receive the same service as the customer served from the city distribution system. If more than one customer is served by a single high pressure regulator set, the cost of the regulator set may be prorated among the customers being served by it.

This classification is available to commercial and small industrial customers who are primarily engaged in the sale and/or manufacture of goods or services. Typical customers under this service classification include restaurants, small manufacturers, schools, institutions, governmental agencies or other service businesses. Customers under this service classification are those whose maximum monthly consumption of natural gas (or estimated maximum monthly consumption in the case of a new customer) during any one 12-month period preceding the last billing date is less than 6,500 MCF. Gas service under this classification is firm and is to be delivered to a customer and shall not be resold or shared with others. This service is not for standby, emergency back-up, or supplemental service.

Industrial firm service customers. This classification is available to industrial customers who are engaged in the manufacture of products or goods and require monthly volumes of natural gas in excess of 6,500 MCF (or estimated consumption in the case of a new customer) during any one 12-month period preceding the last billing. Customers under this service classification will be served under special contract with the city. In the absence of a contract, the provisions of section 38-404(b) shall apply.
Industrial transportation customers. This classification is available to industrial customers using monthly volumes of natural gas in excess of 75,000 MCF (or estimated consumption in the case of a new customer) from any gas supplier during any one 12-month period preceding the last billing. Under this service classification, customers may elect to receive natural gas supply from a third party supplier in the event the city is unable to provide natural gas quantities sufficient to meet the customer's firm and/or interruptible natural gas requirements at the first of the month (FOM) index price as defined by "Inside FERC's Gas Market Report." The city will charge customers a transportation fee for the use of the city's natural gas system for natural gas volumes provided by a third party to customers. Customers under this service classification will be served under special contract with the city. In the absence of a contract, the provisions of section 38-404(b) shall apply.
Interruptible service. Natural gas service on an interruptible basis means that the capacity used to provide the natural gas service is subject to a prior claim by another customer or another class of service and receives a lower priority than such other classes of service.
Interruptible service customers. This classification is available to commercial or industrial customers using monthly volumes of natural gas in excess of 7,500 MCF (or estimated consumption in the case of a new customer) during any one 12-month period preceding the last billing. Natural gas service delivered under this service classification shall be entirely interruptible upon two hours' notice by the city or the city's agent. Customers under this service classification will be served under special contract with the city. In the absence of a contract, the provisions of section 38-404(b) shall apply.
Residential service customers. This classification is available for those residential customers who own or rent a home, condominium, manufactured home, mobile home or apartment and use natural gas for domestic purposes on a yearround basis. Customers under this service classification typically use natural gas for space heating, air conditioning, cooking, water heating or other domestic uses.
