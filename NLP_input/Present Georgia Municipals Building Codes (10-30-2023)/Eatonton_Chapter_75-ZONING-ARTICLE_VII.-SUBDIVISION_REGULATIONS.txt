(7)
The Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.).
(b)
Plats straddling political boundaries. Whenever access to a subdivision is required across land in another governmental jurisdiction, the planning and zoning commission may request assurance from the city attorney that access is legally established, and from the city that the access road is adequately improved. In general, lot lines shall be laid out so as to not cross-jurisdictional boundary lines.
(c)
Suitability of the land. Land subject to flooding, inadequate drainage or erosion or that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for residential use shall not be platted for residential use, nor for any other use that will continue to increase the danger of health, safety and property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected prior to the final plat approval.
(d)
Rejection of land dedication. Whenever a plat proposes the dedication of land to public use that the planning and zoning commission finds not suitable for such public use, the planning and zoning commission shall refuse to approve the plat. Should the planning and zoning commission find that a proposed dedication of land to public use on the preliminary plat or final plat is not required, the planning and zoning commission shall strike such dedication from the plat prior to its approval. Should the planning and zoning commission find that a proposed dedication of land to public use on the final plat is not required, the planning and zoning commission shall refuse to approve that plat.
(e)
Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not be duplicated, nor closely approximate phonetically or visually, the name of any other subdivision in the city. The planning and zoning commission shall have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision, which shall be determined at preliminary plat approval.
(f)
Large-scale developments. The requirements of this article may be modified in the case of a large-scale community, commercial or neighborhood development which is not subdivided into customary lots, blocks and streets. Such modifications shall conform to the purpose and intent of this article, and shall follow the requirements for a planned unit development (PUD) as included in this chapter.
(g)
Required improvements. The requirements of this subsection shall apply to every major subdivision and shall be planned for and provided by the subdivider by installation and/or payment prior to the approval of the final plat.
(1)
Street names. All streets be named and marked with MUTCD signs.

A street that is in alignment with an existing street shall continue the name of the existing street.
(2)
Streets. All streets shall be designed, constructed and paved in accordance with the standards set forth in this article. No street shall be accepted by the city until it shall have been in public use for one year (one-year warranty period) and all repairs required by the city have been completed to the satisfaction of the city. To initiate the one-year warranty period the city must conduct an inspection of the road, grading, grassing, and so forth to determine its suitability and the developer/owner must post a warranty bond or irrevocable letter of credit for at least double of the cost of paving the road or a mutually agreed upon cost. It is the responsibility of the developer to maintain all streets until they are accepted by the city, and issue a surety bond to the city, to provide for such maintenance and repair, should the developer not be able to conduct the required repairs, as provided by this article. The developer shall install all necessary traffic control signs as required by the city. In addition, the subdivider shall provide suitable ground cover, such as grass, on all unpaved areas of street right-of-way or other public areas. All grassing shall be done to DOT specifications.

a.
Design. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots and any drainage feature must be capable of handling at least the 25-year storm event. Sensitive or high-risk areas will require handling larger storm events, which will be the responsibility of the designing engineer.
b.
Design certification. A registered engineer must certify that the proposed storm drainage improvements and other proposed construction is adequate.
c.
Connection to existing systems. If a storm system is located reasonably near the proposed subdivision, then the subdivision must contain an underground storm drainage system, which will be connected to the existing system. Should a storm drainage system not exist then adequate surface drainage facilities shall be installed.
d.
Stormwater management. Stormwater detention facilities or other forms of suitable storage features will be required where more than a five percent increase in runoff occurs between the calculated pre-developed flows and the calculated post-developed flows. The maximum "C" factor to be utilized while calculating flows by the rational method shall be 0.25 for flat and rolling terrain and 0.30 for hilly (seven percent plus) terrain. Calculations shall be shown for the two-, five-, ten-, and 25-year storm events. Emergency spillways shall be sized to handle at least the 100-year storm event. For pre-developed flows, the time of concentration (TOC) shall not be less than ten minutes.
e.
Roadside ditches. Front and back slopes for roadside ditches shall be 3:1 or flatter. Ditches shall be designed to handle at least the 25-year storm event and velocities within the ditch are recommended to be held below five feet per second. Velocities above five feet per second will require additional stabilization practices. Erosion matting meeting DOT specifications is recommended and may be required within any ditch. Check dams or other suitable structures shall be placed in accordance with the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia", latest edition.
f.
Drainage structures. Where drainage pipes, curb inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, and other structures are utilized, these shall conform to the Georgia DOT Standard Detail Manual, latest edition.
