Section 2. - New appointees.
The minimum rate established for the class is the normal hiring rate. Appointments may be made above the minimum rate when such action is determined to be necessary in the best interest of the County. Approval will be based on such conditions as: shortage of qualified applicants available; qualifications of the applicant being in excess of the requirements for the class. When a Department Head wishes to hire a new employee at a salary higher than the minimum for that classification, he/she may submit a written request for a percentage increase to the County Manager. The request must include justification for an increased starting salary, such as exceptional qualifications relating to education, training, or experience.

The County Manager is authorized to approve an increase up to 5% of the minimum salary for that classification.
Section 6. - Reappointments.
A reinstated employee shall be paid at a salary rate within the approved salary range for the position to which he/she is reinstated. The rate of pay shall be approved by the County Manager.

Percentages of increase will be determined annually, and increases will be based on funding available, as decided by the Board of Commissioners. After an employee has reached maximum salary, there will be no further annual increase in salary, unless the salary range for all classifications is adjusted upward by the Board of Commissioners.
B.
Cost of Living Increases: The County Commission may grant an across-the-board cost of living increase at any time it is warranted and funds are available to support the increase. A cost of living increase will cause each increment on the pay schedule to be increased accordingly, at the discretion of the [Commission].

C.
Promotion Increase. When an employee is promoted his/her salary shall be adjusted to the new range which will effect an increase in salary. (See Chapter IV, Section 3.)
D.
Demotion Adjustment. When an employee is demoted, he/she shall be paid at a rate which is within the range for the lower class position. (See Chapter IV, Section 4.)
