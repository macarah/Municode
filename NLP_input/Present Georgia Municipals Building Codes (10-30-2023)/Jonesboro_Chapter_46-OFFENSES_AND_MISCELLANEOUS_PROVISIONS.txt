(3)
Remedy for refusal to pay assessments or to take remedial action. If an alarm user is assessed civil penalties for excessive false alarms and refuses either: (1) to pay the same; or (2) to make immediate remedial action so that excessive false alarms cease, then the city shall be authorized to bring an action in the municipal court of the city to abate the nuisance pursuant to O.C.G.A. Section 41-2-5 and collect the fees.
(f)
Preexisting alarm systems. Alarm systems upon which substantial installation work has already begun on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be required to comply with the construction standards required by section 46-22(b), yet such systems shall in all respects be subject to the false alarm, penalty, and other provisions set forth in this chapter.
