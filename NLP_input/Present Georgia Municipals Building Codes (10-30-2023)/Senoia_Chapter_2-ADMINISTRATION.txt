General budget policies. The budget process provides the primary mechanism by which key decisions are made regarding the levels and types of services to be provided within estimated resources. State law provides the budget requirements for the state local governments. This section provides an outline of the city's application of those laws.
(1)
Scope. This applies to all budgeted funds, which are the responsibility, under the management of the city and the office of the city manager.
(2)
Financing current costs. Current costs shall be financed with current revenues, including the use of authorized fund balances. The city shall avoid balancing current expenditure's through the use of future year's resources. The city shall strive to avoid short-term borrowing or accessing reserves to meet cash flow requirements. However, the city may enter into short-term borrowing or accessing reserves should a critical need arise.
(3)
Budget objectives by type of fund. The following budget objectives are established for the different funds the city uses:
a.
General fund. The annual budget for the general fund shall provide for general government operations of the city and maintain working capital necessary for the city's financial health and stability.

Special revenue fund. The city adopts annual budgets for each special revenue fund that demonstrates that any legally revenue sources are used consistent with applicable laws and/or regulations. (Confiscated asset fund)
c.
Capital projects fund(s). The city adopts project budgets for each of its capital project funds. These adopted appropriations do not lapse at the end of the fiscal year; rather they remain in effect until project completion.
d.
Debt service. The city adopts annual budgets for its debt service. Any remaining balance from prior years plus current year's projected revenues shall be sufficient to meet all annual debt service requirements.
e.
Enterprise funds. The city will adopt budgets for enterprise funds in order to monitor revenue and control expenses. The city will use a business approach when budgeting enterprise funds. Enterprise funds shall be self-supporting.
(b)
Operating budget. The operating budget shall be prepared on an annual basis and include the general fund, enterprise fund(s) and special revenue fund(s). Prior year budget appropriations and prior year actual data will be provided as reference data. Two-year projections of expenditures should be considered to the extent available. At a minimum, the city shall adopt annual balanced budgets for the general fund, special revenue fund and enterprise funds.
(1)
Departmental appropriations. The budget shall be developed based upon "line-item" expenditures within each department and fund. This type of budget focuses on categories of expenditures such as personal services, contractual services, supplies, equipment, etc. within each department and fund. At a minimum, each department's appropriation in each fund shall be detailed within the budget document.
(2)
Budget preparation categories. Each department shall submit budget request separately for:
a.

Balanced budget. The budget shall be balanced for each budgeted fund. Total anticipated revenues plus that portion fund balance in excess of authorized reserves that is designated as a budget-funding source shall equal total estimated expenditures for each fund.
(4)
Budget stabilization resources. The city shall establish a fund balance reserve in all operating funds for working capital. The purpose of the working capital is to cover the cost of expenditures caused by unforeseen emergencies, cover shortfall caused by revenue declines, fund capital projects approved by the mayor and council and to eliminate short-term borrowing for cash flow purposes. The goal of this reserve shall be maintained at no less than two months of operating and debt expenditures.
(5)
Appropriation lapses at year end. All operating budget appropriations (including encumbered appropriations) shall lapse at the end of the fiscal year. Purchases encumbered in the current year, but not received until the following year, must be charged against a department's subsequent year appropriation.

Budget control reports. The city shall maintain a system of budgetary control reports to assure adherence to the budget. The city clerk will prepare and distribute to departments, timely monthly financial reports comparing actual revenues, and outstanding encumbrances and expenditures with budgeted amounts.

The mayor and council must approve all increases in total departmental appropriations, increases in the personal services budget and any other line items previously approved in the budget.

Consultants providing design services, including but not limited to engineering, and architecture, and services such as long-range planning, economic analyses, real estate negotiations, and environmental assessments shall be acquired using qualification based selections. On the occasion when an architecture/engineering consultant needs to be identified for a FAHP project, the solicitation, evaluation, ranking, selection, and negotiation shall comply with the qualifications-based selection procurement procedures for architectural and engineering services codified under 40 U.S.C. 1101-1104, commonly referred to as the Brooks Act. In most situations the following steps shall be followed when acquiring consultant services listed above. The basic steps to procure consultant service are:
a.
Determine the need for services;
b.
Advertise the need for services;
c.
Evaluate the applicants' qualifications;
d.
Select the most qualified firm;
e.
Negotiate with the most qualified firm and
f.
Execute the contract.
The public announcement or public advertisement shall be made in a method to assure that in-state and out-of-state consulting firms are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of an engineering and design related services contract and a fair amount of time to respond to the advertisement. The advertisement shall contain a brief description of the project, clear and accurate information about the technical certifications that are required, response requirement including due date and evaluation criteria.
When determining the most highly qualified consultant the following shall apply:
1.
The following shall be considered: technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance. If necessary, the City of Senoia may conduct interview, in-person or otherwise to make final selection of the architect/engineer consultant.
2.
Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation. Compensation shall be negotiated with the most qualified consultant.
3.
In-State or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase.
4.
A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate.

The participation of qualified and certified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) sub-consultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate.
Approval of all contracts with consultants shall be in accordance with policies of the City of Senoia and approved in the accordance with the Charter of the City of Senoia.
(5)
Award of bids. Bids are awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. A responsive bid is one that conforms in all material respects to the need of the city. Responsible means a bidder who has the capability to perform the requirements.
(6)
Local bidder preference. If all other relevant factors are met, each department is authorized to negotiate with and select a local vendor if the local vendor's bid is within 10 percent of the lowest offer. A current City of Senoia business license is required to be considered as a local vendor. Local bidder will not be considered in qualification based selection (QBS).
(7)
Equal opportunity. The City of Senoia will provide an equal opportunity for all businesses to participate in city contracts regardless of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status. The city will actively seek to ensure that minority-owned and operated firms and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) have the opportunity to participate in the purchasing process, including bidding, negotiations and contract awards. The city will not knowingly conduct business with contractors that discriminate or permit discrimination against persons because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status.
(8)
Ineligible vendors. Any person, firm, or corporation who is in arrears to the city for taxes, or otherwise, will not be qualified to bid on any purchase until their lien to the city has been cleared. No requisition will be approved for such vendors.
(9)
State contracts. The city is authorized to use state contracts in lieu of issuing bids to vendors or buying locally when it is to the economic advantage of the city or deemed appropriate by the city manager. The state contract price may be used to establish the maximum price for a good or service.
(10)
Back-up policy and emergency purchases. The city should strive to decrease dependency on single-source vendors in order to achieve maximum efficiency in its purchases. In order to achieve the city's fiscal independence, it is strongly suggested that each department have back-up vendors for each recurring and/or large purchase.
In cases of emergency, a contract may be awarded without competitive bidding, but the procurement shall be made with as much competition as the circumstances allow (i.e., informal quotes). An emergency is defined as a threat to life or property, or an unforeseen situation that curtails or greatly diminishes an essential service as determined by the city manager. In the event of an emergency, the city manager shall be contacted.
(b)
Decentralization of purchasing authority.

Purchasing of goods. Each department head shall have the authority to conduct essential spending within the authorization of the budget. Department heads shall have the authority to purchase goods costing less than $10,000.00 each as long as costs remain within the approved budget. Each department head is responsible to ensure that internal control procedures, including those issued by the city manager, are followed.
For individual goods costing over $10,000.00, the department shall make every effort to solicit a minimum of three competitive prices. To the extent that an emergency condition exists or an item is supplied by only one source, the department head shall inform the city manager and make the appropriate notation on the purchase order. Purchases that are in the approved budget shall have the authorization of the city manager. Those requests outside the scope of the approved budget shall be placed on the agenda and receive the authorization of the mayor and council.
