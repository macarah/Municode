ARTICLE XIII. - C-1, NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS DISTRICT

Section 13.01. - State of purpose.
The neighborhood business district established in this article is intended to be that permitting retail business and service uses which are needed to serve the nearby residential areas. In order to promote such business development so far as is possible and appropriate in each area, uses are prohibited which would create hazards, offensive and loud noises, vibration, smoke glare, heavy truck traffic, or late hours of operation. The intent of this district is also to encourage the concentration of local business area in locations proposed in the comprehensive development plan to the mutual advantages of both the consumers and merchants and thereby promote the best use of land at certain strategic locations and avoid the continuance of encouraging marginal, strip, business development along major streets/roads.
