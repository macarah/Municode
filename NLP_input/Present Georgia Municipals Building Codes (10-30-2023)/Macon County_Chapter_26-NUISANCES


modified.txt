Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after filing of said complaint in the proper court; that the owner and any parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint.
(b)
Issuance of order. If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure under consideration is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served, upon the owner and/or interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing, an order:
(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure, in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations, cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property.

(c)
Repair or demolition by county.
(1)
If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to repair, vacate and close, or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of any building, dwelling or structure so closed a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions; the use or occupation of this building for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use is prohibited and unlawful."

If the owner fails to comply with any order to remove or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be removed or demolished; provided, however, that the duties of the public officer set forth in this section and in this subsection shall not be exercised until the board of commissioners have by ordinance ordered the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article with respect to the particular property which the public officer has found to be unfit for human habitation or unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use, which property shall be described in the ordinance.
(d)

The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. If the dwelling, building or structure is removed or demolished by the public officer, such public officer shall sell the materials of such dwellings, buildings or structure and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court of the county by the public officer, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court.
(2)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the county to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. The public officer and board of county commissioners are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such materials salvaged from such dwellings, buildings or structure, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(e)
Collection of amount due on lien. The county may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for removal or demolition of dwellings, buildings or structures only in the following manner:

The owner or parties at interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the county within 30 days after the perfection of the lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying to the county the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall be due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as prescribed in this subsection.
(2)
Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest at any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the county.
(3)
Should the amount due on such lien or any portion thereof be unpaid after the passage of the three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for under this section, the county may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for alteration, repair, removal or demolition of dwellings, buildings, or structures in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358, and other applicable state statutes. This procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any persons having any right, title or interest in or lien upon the property, all as provided by O.C.G.A. title 48, chapter 4, article 3 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-220 et seq.).
