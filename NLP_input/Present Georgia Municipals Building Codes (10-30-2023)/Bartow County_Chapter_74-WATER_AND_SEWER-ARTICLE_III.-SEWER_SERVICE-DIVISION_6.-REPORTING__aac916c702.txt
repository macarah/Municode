(3)
The user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
(4)
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the superintendent.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 37)
Sec. 74-373. - Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the superintendent a report containing the information described in subsection 74-352(b) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 74-325 of this article.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 38)
Sec. 74-374. - Periodic compliance reports.
(a)
All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the superintendent but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 74-325 of this article.
(b)
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(c)
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in section 74-380 of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 39)
Sec. 74-375. - Reports of changed conditions.
Each user must notify the superintendent of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
(1)
The superintendent may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 74-324 of this article.
(2)
The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 74-322 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 74-347 of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(3)
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 40)
Sec. 74-376. - Reports of potential problems.
(a)
In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(b)
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
(c)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 41)
Sec. 74-377. - Reports from unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the superintendent as the superintendent may require.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 42)
Sec. 74-378. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.
If the sampling performed by the user indicates a violation the user must notify the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the superintendent monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the superintendent samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 43)
Sec. 74-379. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(a)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste under 40 CFR 26 1, EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user; an identification of the constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification of changed conditions must be submitted under section 74-374 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 74-352, 74-372, and 74-373 of this article.
(b)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d), 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 44)
Sec. 74-380. - Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 45)
Sec. 74-381. - Sample collection.
(a)
Except as indicated in subsection (b) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 46)
Sec. 74-382. - Timing.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 47)
Sec. 74-383. - Record keeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples, the dates the analyses were performed, who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user of the county, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the superintendent.
