Sec. 98-274. - Prohibited wastes enumerated.
No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced, directly or indirectly into the POTW, any pollutant or wastewater which will pass through or interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all users of a POTW whether or not the user is subject to any other national categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances to any POTW:
(1)
Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including but not limited to wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; nor any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time, shall two successive readings on any explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hybrides and sulfides and any other substances which the city, the state or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system; nor any petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
(2)
Solid or viscose substances in amounts which will cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides, or fleshing entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from the refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
(3)
Any wastewater having a pH of less than 5.0 or in excess of 10.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment.
(4)
Any wastewater which results in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems or containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, whether singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to, section 307(a) of the Act.
(5)
Pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW.
(6)
Wastewater having a temperature greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) at the introduction into the POTW or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference.
(7)
Trucked or hauled pollutants including septic tank waste, except at discharge points and at such times designated by the director of utilities. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director of utilities or his designated representative and the city may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Such waste shall not violate provisions of this article or other requirements established by the city. The director of utilities shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits and may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director of utilities may also prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall also identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous waste.
(8)
Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving stream water quality standards.
(Code 1976, § 5-2074)
Sec. 98-275. - Limited discharges.
(a)
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the director of utilities that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving system, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the director of utilities will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
(1)
Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(2)
Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharge to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed under section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used.
(3)
Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions.
(4)
Any wastewater containing radioactive wastes of isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director of utilities in compliance with applicable state and federal regulations.
(5)
Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance.
(6)
Any waters or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius).

(8)
Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes, or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not.
(9)
Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor-producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the director of utilities as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
(10)
Any waters containing quantities of radium, naturally occurring, or artificially produced radioisotopes in excess of presently existing or subsequently accepted limits for drinking water as established by the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measuring.
(11)
Materials which exert or cause:
a.
Any waters containing suspended solids of such character and quantity that unusual provision, attention or expense is required to handle such materials at the wastewater treatment plant.
b.
Any waste which has unusual volume, concentration of solids, or composition that may create obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference with the proper operation and treatment of influent of the wastewater works.
(b)
When the director of utilities determines that a user is contributing to the POTW of the substances enumerated in subsection (a) of this section in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the directors shall:
(1)
Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and
(2)

(Code 1976, § 5-2075; Ord. No. 79-8, 3-7-1979; Ord. No. 89-42, 11-9-1989; Ord. No. 93-41, 10-21-1993)
Sec. 98-276. - Calculation of local limits.
(a)
The director of utilities shall calculate limits for such substances which shall be technically based using applicable POTW process limits and state and/or federal water quality standards and sludge regulations. The limits fixed in this section may be used as a guide and plant control but may be altered by the director of utilities in the event of a cumulative overload on a particular drainage basin or the POTW in order to protect against pass through or interference.
Fixed Upper Limits for Constituents (ppm by weight)
EXPAND
Antimony 5.00
Arsenic 0.110
Beryllium 0.00013
Cadmium 0.0016
Chromium 0.500

  The limits set forth in this subsection apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The director of utilities may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of the concentration-based limitations of this subsection.
(b)
Prior to the adoption of the 1996 revisions of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the city has issued permits to several existing users whose historical discharge of BOD, total suspended solids and/or ammonia exceed the concentration limits of this section. The director of utilities may renew these existing permits provided that the existing mass load of pollutants from any of these individual industries shall not increase above the historic average and that the discharge shall not cause a cumulative overload on a particular basin.
Sec. 98-277. - Federal categorical pretreatment standards.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405—471 are hereby incorporated.
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass of the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director of utilities may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director of utilities shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(Code 1976, § 5-2076)
Sec. 98-278. - State requirements.
State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article.
(Code 1976, § 5-2078)
Sec. 98-279. - City's right of revision.
The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 98-275.
(Code 1976, § 5-2078)
Sec. 98-280. - Excessive discharge.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with discharge limitations unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director of utilities may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Code 1976, § 5-2080)
Sec. 98-281. - Accidental discharges.
Each user shall provide protection from the accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own costs and expense. At least once every two years, the director of utilities shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the city of any accidental or slug discharge; and
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and control of plant runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
Review and approval of such plans and procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
(Code 1976, § 5-2081)
Sec. 98-282. - Written notice.
Within five days following an accidental discharge the user shall submit to the superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law.
(Code 1976, § 5-2082)
Sec. 98-283. - Notice to employees.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Code 1976, § 5-2083)
Sec. 98-284. - Flow equalization.
(a)
The admission into the public sewers of any waters or wastes in volumes, or with constituents, such that existing dilution conditions in the sewers or at the treatment plant would be affected to the detriment of the city, shall be subject to review and approval of the director of utilities. When necessary in the opinion of the director of utilities, pretreatment or equalizing units may be required to bring constituents or volume of flow within the limits previously prescribed or to an otherwise acceptable level, and to hold or equalize flows such that no peak flow conditions may hamper the operation of any unit of the sewer system. The equalization or holding unit shall have a capacity suitable to serve the intended purpose and be equipped with acceptable outlet control facilities to provide flexibility in operation and accommodate changing conditions in the waste flow.
(b)
Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained at the user's expense. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
(Code 1976, § 5-2084)
Sec. 98-285. - Grease, oil and sand interceptors.
(a)
Generally. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of fats, grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of the type and capacity approved the department of human resources public health chapter 290-5-14-.06, and the City of Valdosta Land Development Regulations chapter 332, section 332-31 or as deemed appropriate by the director and shall be so located as to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, to prevent the passage of accumulated fats, grease and oil, sludge or sand into the publicly owned treatment works. A regular inspection, cleaning and repair schedule may be imposed when such schedule is reasonably deemed necessary by the director to prevent the passage of grease and oil, sludge or sand into the publicly owned treatment works. Such interception units shall be considered pretreatment devices as defined in section 98-145. Inspections, cleaning and repairs shall be by the owner, at the owner's expense.
(b)
Installation requirements and design criteria.
(1)
All new and remodeled food industry customers and institutions with commercial kitchens shall have a properly designed and maintained grease interceptor or series of grease interceptors meeting the design criteria contained in the City of Valdosta Land Development Regulations chapter 332, section 332-31.

(a)
When required by the director of utilities, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director of utilities. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. The monitoring facilities should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
(b)
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be kept clean and maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city.
(Code 1976, § 5-2088)
Sec. 98-287. - Sample collection and analytical requirements.
(a)
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
(b)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab sampling techniques. For all other analyses, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional, composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director of utilities may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(Code 1976, § 5-2089)
Sec. 98-288. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director of utilities within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director of utilities within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the director of utilities or his representative monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the director or representative samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user received the results of this sampling.
Sec. 98-289. - Notification of discharge of hazardous waste.
The discharge of any substance which if otherwise disposed of would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, into the POTW of the city is prohibited. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the PPTW of the incident and to provide all verbal and written notifications required by this article for accidental discharges. The user shall also be responsible for making all other notifications as required by EPD, EPA and other authorities.
