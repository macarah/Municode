ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 34-1. - Purpose and findings.
The mayor and city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city, further, finds that signs have become excessive and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the City of Tucker in enacting this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to implement the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the city;
(2)
To regulate the erection and placement of signs in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians;
(3)
To preserve the value of the property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed;
(4)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts and the preservation of the city's historical and culturally significant features and landmarks;
(5)
To maintain a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for the city's residents, workers, and visitors and to improve aesthetics;
(6)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city;
(7)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses, and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods, or services so as to promote the economic vitality of businesses;
(8)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the Georgia and United States Constitutions;
(9)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent, and character of those districts;
(10)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits;
(11)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
(12)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety, and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs; and
(13)
To prohibit all signs not expressly authorized by this chapter, to provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
