DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 30-201. - Short title.
This article shall be known and cited as the "White County Mountain and Hillside Protection Resolution."
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-202. - Mountain and hillside protection district map adopted.
A county mountain and hillside protection district map, as prepared after a process of thorough public input during the preparation of this article, is hereby adopted and made part of this article as if fully set forth herein. Said map shall be signed and dated by the chairman of the county board of commissioners and attested and sealed by the county clerk.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-203. - Reference to adopted mountain protection map.
The comprehensive plan of the county includes a mountain protection plan and map of mountain protection areas. Said map was adopted by the county board of commissioners via Resolution Number 94-6, adopted January 27, 1994, which adopted by reference the mountain and river corridor protection plans as an amendment to the county comprehensive plan. Said map is distinguished from the mountain and hillside protection district map referenced in section 30-202 of this article and shall remain in effect per section 50-1 of the county Code. Said map shows properties with elevations of 2,200 feet or more mean sea level, and such map is not a complete depiction of the jurisdiction of this article.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-204. - Goals.
This article is adopted in order to further the following goals:
(1)
To preserve the appearance and protect the natural resources of the county's mountains and hillsides;
(2)
To protect ridgelines and steep slopes;
(3)
To prevent soil erosion, and to control stormwater runoff;
(4)
To protect trees and other native vegetation;
(5)
To encourage responsible development and to allow for reasonable uses that complement the natural and visual character of the natural landscape;
(6)
To encourage the application of sound and innovative design principles to development of these areas; and

DIVISION 6. - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 30-251. - Applicability.
The following standards and restrictions shall apply to all property and activities subject to the requirements of this article.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-252. - Average slope calculation.
Slope is the amount of vertical change in elevation per unit of horizontal distance. For the purposes of determining whether the natural slope is 25 percent or more, the natural slope of a given property shall be calculated perpendicular to topographic contours from property line to property line. Slope calculations methods that are permitted include measuring the proximity of contour lines on a quadrangle map; using appropriate computer algorithms working on USGS Digital Elevation Models and GIS or other software; or by a licensed professional experienced in measuring or calculating slope. For the construction of single family residences, property owners may submit an alternative method of slope calculation for consideration. These methods may include, but are not limited to, weighted average, slope mapping, or other field-based techniques. In such cases, a certified determination by a licensed professional will be accepted as final determination.
A contour map is the essential tool in determining the average slope of a parcel, and shall be required with each application for preliminary plat approval. Contour information shall be included in the preliminary site plan or plat. When used, a contour map can supply all the necessary information to calculate slope using the following formula for average slope provided below.
S = 0.0023 × I × L
A
.0023 = Conversion faction (converts from square feet to acres)
I = Contour intervals (distance between adjacent contour lines)
L = Contour length (total length of contour lines within parcel)
A = Acres in parcel
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-253. - Division of area.
Where there is a drastic variation in the landform character within one site, the site may be divided into several distinct areas for the purposes of slope determination. This division must be approved by the community development director or designee. Generally, this provision shall only be used in cases where large tracts of property encompass flat land as well as significant mountain and hillside terrain. Details for each division calculation must be provided.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-254. - Land disturbance areas and impervious surface limits.
Except for lots of record existing as of November 29, 2005 as provided in section 30-225 of this article, land-disturbing activity is limited to specific areas within a parcel not to exceed amounts as shown in Table 1. This area does not include setbacks, buffers, easements, etc. There must be an adequate amount of buildable land for proposed structure(s) and all land disturbing activities (i.e., roadways, driveways, septic/sewage areas, public structures, etc.). Once the buildable area is determined, the location of the development is left to the landowner, subject to compliance with all other adopted regulations.
Except for lots of record existing on November 29, 2005 as provided in Section 30-225 of this Article, the total impervious surface resulting from development on any individual lot shall not exceed the amounts shown in Table 1. Alternatives to paving on individual residential lots are encouraged.
Table 1
EXPAND
Average Slope of Lot To Be Developed Minimum Lot Size (acres) Maximum Percent of Lot That May Be Disturbed Maximum Percent of Lot That May Be Impervious Surface
25—29% 1.5 30 20
30—34% 2 25 15%
35—39% 2.5 20 10%
40% or more 3 17 5
  (Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05; Res. No. 2006-49, 12-5-06)
Sec. 30-255. - Limited disturbance areas.
No development or land disturbance activity may occur in the following areas of a parcel. These areas may be included in the area used to calculate compliance with the minimum standards shown in table 1:
(1)
Rock outcroppings;
(2)
Wetlands or buffer areas along streams;
(3)
Natural drainage ways;
(4)
All sensitive natural areas;
(5)
Significant historical and archeological resource areas as defined by the National Register of Historic Places or other federal and state agencies.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to the crossing of streams and creeks for utility corridors and roadways if construction does not exceed 1,000 square feet, does not reduce drainage, and meets all other criteria for land disturbance activities as set forth in the county soil and erosion resolution, as amended.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-256. - Water system requirements.
Where one or more wells are to be used for individual water supply, the proposed land disturbing activity and connection of building or structure to the water system shall meet all applicable requirements of the Georgia Water Well Standards Act of 1985, as amended; the requirements of the rules and regulations of the department of human resources regarding individual or nonpublic wells, and any more stringent requirements that may be imposed by regulation of the board of commissioners.
If a public system is to be provided, the water supply system must meet all applicable requirements of the "Georgia Safe Drinking Water Act of 1977," as amended, and any other regulations that may be imposed by the state or the county board of commissioners.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-257. - On-site sewage management system requirements.
Where septic tanks are to be used for individual sewage disposal, county health department and state regulations must be followed.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-258. - Minimum lot size and lot width.
This section shall apply only to lots created after November 29, 2005, the effective date of the original resolution adopting mountain and hillside protection. Slope-density regulations correlate intensity of development to the steepness of terrain in order to minimize damage from grading and removal of vegetation and land instability. In order to assure that the natural function of the land, density on steeper slopes must be lower than on flatter terrain. The maximum number of lots that maybe permitted to be subdivided from any tract depends on the average slope and the minimum lot size and minimum lot width requirements as specified in this section.
Except as provided in section 30-259 of this code, no lot that is subject to the requirements of this article shall be approved for subdivision unless it complies with the requirements of table 1.
(Res. No. 2006-49, 12-5-06)
Editor's note— Res. No. 2006-49, adopted December 5, 2006, amended the Code by repealing former § 30-258, and adding a new § 30-258. Former § 30-258 pertained to slope-density provisions, and derived from Res. No. 2005-32, adopted November 29, 2005.
Sec. 30-259. - Reduction of minimum lot sizes and lot widths.
This section shall apply only to lots created after November 29, 2005, the effective date of the original resolution adopting mountain and hillside protection. Cluster development may ease the need for services and take advantage of the best orientation for dwellings and other buildings, thus the rural character can be maintained through preservation of woodland and greenways. Such development can reduce the need of infrastructure and associated development costs can be lowered. Lots created after November 29, 2005 shall meet the requirements of section 30-258 of this code, except as follows:
(1)
At the time of preliminary plat approval, an applicant may request and the county may grant approval of a subdivision for residential development that clusters the lots and residential development in a specific area of the tract, with the balance of land in that tract being designated as permanent green space. Lots within that cluster area may have a reduced lot width provided that no lot shall have a width, at the building site, of less than 100 feet.
(2)
Lots within the clustered area may be reduced to the lot size minimum allowed by other regulations the county health department based on the availability of public water or sewer or approved private sewer systems.
(Res. No. 2006-49, 12-5-06)
Editor's note— Res. No. 2006-49, adopted December 5, 2006, amended the Code by repealing former § 30-259, and adding a new § 30-259. Former § 30-259 pertained to permitted number of parcels in large scale developments; and derived from Res. No. 2005-32, adopted November 29, 2005.
Sec. 30-260. - Permitted size of construction area.
In order to protect the natural character of mountains and hillsides, the land, in amounts as shown in table 1, must be maintained in a natural state. The total impervious surface resulting from development must not exceed the amounts shown in table 1. Alternatives to paving on individual residential lots are encouraged. This does not include the necessity of cutting of diseased trees due to infestation or areas under forestry or agricultural use. These areas must be included on the site plan.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-261. - Storm drainage.
The potential for rapid erosion is extremely high in mountainous and hillside areas. Steep slopes create perfect conditions for rapid movement of soils downhill during rainfall. Therefore it is essential to address storm water drainage and soil and erosion before land disturbing activities begin. Natural drainage flows should be maintained wherever possible and developers and landowners are encouraged to use the best technology available to reduce the effects of this increased flow. All applications that affect the natural flow of storm water must meet all local regulations. This will include, but may not be limited to, the erosion and sediment control resolution. Stormwater flow shall not be altered from its natural flow so as to impact or damage the property of others.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-262. - Clearing and grading.
A great deal of environmental damage associated with new development can be avoided if construction and the position of the development site are well planned. As the most potentially destructive part of the construction process, grading must be carefully planned and executed to maintain the stability of protected mountain and hillside property. The choice of an appropriate building site is the key to minimizing potential erosion problems. Grading, if required on the site, shall not take place prior to site plan approval and issuance of any permit required by the county soil erosion and sedimentation control resolution. Only areas which have been approved for disturbance may be disturbed, and then only after all erosion measures and other regulations have been met.
The applicant's plans for meeting the following standards will be reviewed during planning or before construction begins:
(1)
Cut and fill activities may be minimized by carefully selecting the site for structures, drainfields, septic tanks, etc.
(2)
Grading areas should be clearly marked before any grading begins. Highly visible fencing is recommended to prohibit earthmoving equipment from moving beyond designated grading boundaries.
(3)
Cut slope and fill slopes of steeper than 2:1 slope ratio will only be considered if shown to provide for more effective environmental protection while still being permanently stabilized with rock or other approved stabilization method. Alternative measures such as retaining walls of limited height may be used.
(4)
Grading should be phased so that prompt re-vegetation will provide optimal erosion controls.
(5)
All top and bottom edges of slopes caused by either cut or fill should be a minimum of two feet away from property lines.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05; Res. No. 2006-49, 12-5-06)
Sec. 30-263. - Public roads.
All roads that are intended for public maintenance must comply with county subdivision regulations and any other applicable regulations including but not limited to those for soil erosion and sediment control. Design and construction of such roads must be approved by the public works director. Variances to road requirements must be separately approved by the board of commissioners but an approval may be given if the result would provide stronger environmental protection while still maintaining public safety concerns.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-264. - Private roads.
All private roads must comply with the county subdivision regulations and any other applicable regulations including but not limited to those for soil erosion and sediment control. Roads not intended for public maintenance must be designed and constructed to the standards in table 2, and approved by the public works director. Where private roads are proposed as extensions of existing public roads, the developer must clearly justify why existing public roads should not be extended for public use. Where private road designs are used for approvable of a subdivision, the following special notation shall be placed on the final plat, in bold type:
"Roads within this subdivision are designated private, and will not be accepted for maintenance by the county unless owner(s) of the right of way meets the standard for public roads at the time of application."
For the purposes of this regulation, the following road classifications will apply to this section:
(1)
Private residential collector is a road or section of a road which:
a.
Provides direct or indirect access from the entrance of the subdivision inward to 20 or more proposed residential lots and is designed to be the main travel path for residential access;
b.
Is designed to serve, or has the potential to serve in a future phase, property in the same ownership as the applicant, and, if developed will meet the 20 dwelling-unit standard;
c.
Connects proposed development with existing developments when the aggregate sum of residential lots in both developments meets the 20 dwelling unit standard;
d.
Serves a nonresidential facility located within a resident development, such as recreation areas, club house, golf course, public utility sites, etc.
(2)
Private residential subdivision road is a road or group of roads which:
a.
Abuts less than 20 residential lots;
b.
Serves less than 20 existing lots or proposed residential dwelling units;
c.
Does not connect thoroughfares.
(3)
Private shared roadway is a road or group of roads which:
a.
Abuts no more than five residential lots
b.
Serves no more than five existing or proposed residential dwelling units
c.
Does not connect thoroughfares.

  1 Alternative cul-de-sacs may be approved to minimize clearing and grading in protected mountain areas. The alternative cul-de-sac can be T's or other designs as long as they meet accepted design standards and address public safety concerns.
2 In cases where the existing cross slope is 20 percent or greater, 1.5 to 1 cut and fill slopes shall be permitted provided that the developer guarantees that the slope will be adequately stabilized.
3 In cases where the existing cross slope is 25 percent or greater, 1 to 1 cut-and-fill slopes shall be permitted provided that the developer guarantees that the slope will be adequately stabilized. Other steep slope alternatives will be considered in protected mountain areas to minimize clearing and grading. Examples could be retaining walls, stabilization with rock or other engineered materials, etc., as long as they meet sound engineering design standards.
4 Maximum cut and fill slopes may be required to be flatter if required by site specific conditions for stability.
The minimum turning radius of a cul-de-sac on a private shared residential road shall be 35 feet. Alterative cul-de-sacs may be acceptable if designed within the requirements of the Georgia State Amendments to the International Fire Code, appendix D, fire apparatus access roads; figure D103.1, dead-end fire apparatus access road turnaround.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05; Res. No. 2006-28, 6-6-06; Res. No. 2007-5, 2-8-07)
Sec. 30-265. - Retaining walls.
Retaining walls, where required, are recommended not to exceed ten feet in height and should be built to follow the contours of the land. Where greater total height is needed, two retaining walls should be considered with vegetation between them. Vegetation should be planted to screen large retaining walls from view.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-266. - Setbacks.
Setbacks will be used to protect natural features of the mountain and hillside terrain. The following minimum setbacks shall be maintained unless otherwise determined by site plan review:
(1)
Placing structures away from the shoulder reduces the visual impact of development as well as erosion on steep slopes. All structures must be setback a minimum of 20 feet from the shoulder of a ridgeline. The shoulder is defined as the plane at which the slope of the land changes from greater than 25 percent to a ridge top of less than 25 percent. See Figure 1. Natural vegetation must be maintained undisturbed within the setback area except for access to a lot or limited cutting to provide a view. All other setbacks including, but not limited to, those from streams, creeks, springheads and property lines must be met as required by the county Code.

Sec. 30-267. - Ridgeline development.
Ridge lines in protected areas shall be left in their natural state except that roadways may be constructed along the ridgeline. Design and construction of roadways must be approved by the public works director, or designee, and in accordance with applicable regulations and as required by this article or other applicable provisions of the county Code.

Editor's note— Res. No. 2006-49, adopted December 5, 2006, amended the Code by repealing former § 30-268 in its entirety. Former § 30-268 pertained to cluster development, and derived from Res. No. 2005-32, adopted November 29, 2005.
Sec. 30-269. - Restrictions.
The following applications are prohibited on lands subject to the requirements of this article:
(1)
Handling areas for receiving and storage of hazardous waste and solid waste disposal facilities are prohibited.
(2)
Mining activities are prohibited unless previously permitted by the department of natural resources.
(3)
Cell towers are prohibited in the protected areas except where the design and structure thereof blend in with the surroundings and are camouflaged.

DIVISION 7. - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 30-281. - Purpose.
Design regulations are not designed to prevent creativity or mandate a particular style of dwelling. Rather, they are essential to the goal of reducing visual impacts of development while ensuring the stability of the protected mountain and hillside regions.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-282. - Building heights.
No building is permitted to exceed 40 feet from the natural grade of the land, as measured perpendicular from the highest point on the structure to the point of natural grade on the ground. Chimneys and power poles are not included in the height calculations. At no time shall a building extend above the existing tree canopy.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05; Res. No. 2006-49, 12-5-06)
Sec. 30-283. - Outdoor lighting.
While lighting outside of homes is often necessary, it can be quite obtrusive in the night skyline. Mountainous and hillside areas are generally rural in character and should be maintained as such even in the presence of development. The following guidelines shall be adhered to when placing outside lights:
(1)
All lights shall have shielded fixtures that direct the light downward. These shields shall eliminate scattered light and excessive glare.
(2)
Light poles shall not exceed the height of surrounding buildings.
(Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05)
Sec. 30-284. - Landscaping.
Because the mountainous and hillside areas of the county are largely valued for their natural beauty, it is the intention of these regulations to preserve this forested quality. Any new development will create areas that will temporarily be deforested and/or unsightly.
(1)
No construction equipment or development is permitted in areas outside those designated and approved for land disturbance. Such areas outside those portions of the lot designated and approved for land disturbance shall be left in their natural state. A natural state is defined as the condition prior to development or other human activity.
(2)
Re-vegetation is required on all disturbed areas that remain after construction, including areas around permanent structures, resurfaced areas such as driveways and areas of cuts and fills, pursuant to land disturbance regulations. Where trees have been removed due to insect damage or disease, and this tree removal increases the land disturbance percentage in amounts that exceed amounts specified in Table 1, replanting is required.
(3)
All stream buffers are to be maintained in a natural state pursuant to county soil and erosion regulations and state water quality control rules.
(4)
Color choices that are considered to blend in with the surroundings of the site shall be considered natural in color and will require minimum replanting of vegetation for screening purposes. Color choices that stand out against the natural colors of the surrounding area will be considered intrusive and will require screening with natural vegetation that will minimize the effect on the surrounding area. The amount of screening required will be reviewed and approved by the director of community development or designee but will in no way require screening of more than 50 percent of the structure as a whole. Planted vegetation must achieve the required screening percentage within two years of planting and must be done within six months of the main structure receiving a certificate of occupancy.
(5)
Trees eight inches, or greater, in diameter that are cut for view will be done in a staggered fashion to eliminate the tunnel effect caused by clear cutting. Reducing clear cuttings reduce the potential for erosion, stormwater runoff and landscaping and grading costs. Keeping mature greenery is recommended wherever possible to provide immediate aesthetic, environmental, and potentially monetary value.

DIVISION 8. - TREE PROTECTION (REGULATIONS SPECIFICALLY AFFECTING ONGOING PROPERTY MAINTENANCE, TREE CANOPY MAINTENANCE AND TREE CANOPY PRESERVATION WITHIN THE DESIGNATED MOUNTAIN AND HILLSIDE PROTECTION DISTRICT)

Sec. 30-291. - Purpose and intent.
This division applies to any cutting of trees eight inches, or greater, in diameter as part of the ongoing maintenance of property which does not require a land disturbing permit or building permit.
(Res. No. 2019-14, 10-7-19)
Sec. 30-292. - Pre-application review.
Property owners are urged to consult early and informally with the director of community development or designee. The purpose of this informal review is to consider the requirements and guidelines of this article, and to review any other regulations and conditions that may apply, and to request advice and guidance concerning the cutting of trees. No fee shall be charged and no formal application shall be required for the pre-application review.
(Res. No. 2019-14, 10-7-19)
Sec. 30-293. - Permits.
(a)
Permit application. As part of the ongoing maintenance of property, no person shall cut or remove trees (eight inches in diameter or greater), or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a tree cutting permit for such activity.
(1)
When required. Any owner, authorized agent, or contractor who desires to cut or remove trees, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make application to the director of community development or designee and obtain the required permit for the work.
Exception: Permits shall not be required for the following work:
a.
Minor trimming of branches;
b.
Removal of dead, diseased or severely damaged tree; or
c.
Emergency removal of downed trees presenting a hazard.
(Res. No. 2019-14, 10-7-19)
Sec. 30-294. - Permit fees.
(a)
Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the governing body have been paid. A fee, as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the county clerk's office, will be charged for the processing of a permit.
(b)
Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any tree cutting work before obtaining the necessary permit, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees.
(Res. No. 2019-14, 10-7-19)
Sec. 30-295. - Tree cutting activity.
(a)
Trees eight inches, or greater, in diameter that are cut for view as part of the ongoing maintenance of the property will be done in a staggered fashion to eliminate the tunnel effect caused by clear cutting. Reducing clear-cuttings reduces the potential for erosion, stormwater runoff and landscaping and grading costs. Keeping mature greenery is recommended wherever possible to provide immediate aesthetic, environmental, and potentially monetary value.
(b)
Tree topping performed for view and/or as part of the ongoing maintenance of the property will be done in a staggered fashion to eliminate the tunnel effect caused by clear cutting.
(c)
All stream buffers are to be maintained in a natural state pursuant to county soil and erosion regulations and state water quality control rules.
(Res. No. 2019-14, 10-7-19)
Sec. 30-296. - Fees for loss of tree canopy.
The cutting of any trees in violation of this division shall be punished by a fine of $100.00 per tree, per violation occurring on each tract, not to exceed a maximum civil penalty of $2,500.00, in the alternative White County may choose to prosecute the violation as a criminal case not to exceed a fine in the amount $1,000.00 and imprisonment in the county jail, not exceeding 180 days, or both a fine and sentence of imprisonment, or as specified by state laws and ordinances of the county. The fine per tree may be based on the number of felled trees and where trees have been removed the number of cut tree stumps measuring eight inches or greater.
