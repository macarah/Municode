The owner or operator of a vehicle shall be liable for a monetary penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such vehicle is found, as evidenced by information obtained from a traffic light signal violation monitoring system, to have failed to comply with a traffic light signal as designated in Subsections 1. and/or 2. of this subsection within the city limits.
C.
Proof; Certificate.
1.
Proof that a particular vehicle entered an intersection in violation of Section 10-4-170 B.1. or 2. of the Marietta City Code, as detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system, together with proof that the particular vehicle is registered with the Georgia Department of Public Safety (or any other state vehicle registration office) in the charged person's name, shall raise the evidentiary presumption and constitute prima facie evidence in any prosecution of a violation of that section that the charged person was the person driving the vehicle depicted in the recorded image. Such presumption may be rebutted.
2.
A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by certified peace officer employed by the City of Marietta, or a facsimile thereof, based on inspection of recorded images produced by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.

5.
Not withstanding any other provision of this section, if the recorded image detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of Section 10-4-170 B.1. or 2. of the Marietta City Code is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the alleged violation with at least two recorded images thereof.

After receipt by the City of Marietta of the proof of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of Section 10-4-170 B. 1. or 2. of the Marietta City Code to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible as set forth in Section 10-4-170 C.1. of the Marietta City Code.

D.
Graffiti Penalty. Any person who is convicted of violating this Ordinance shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or by imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both such fine and imprisonment.

3.
For the purposes of giving notice to the owner of the property, the person shown as the owner of said property on the City of Marietta tax records shall be sent such notice at the address shown thereon unless the city receives actual notice that another person owns said property. In addition, the owner may notify the city that the tenant, pursuant to a written lease, has control of the property or has control of that portion of the property which is the subject of this article and, in the event the city receives such notice, the city shall notify the tenant of the notice of removal as provided in this article and proceed against the tenant and not the owner.

10-8-080 - Crime reduction program for designated apartment complexes.
A.
Purpose.
(1)
A correlation exists between high crime rates at an apartment complex and an apartment complex's failure to meet minimum property standards. High crime rates contribute to the deterioration, decay, disrepair, and substandard appearance and condition of the structures and premises of an apartment complex. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the occupants of apartment complexes and other citizens of the City of Marietta by obtaining greater compliance with minimum property standards through the establishment of a mandatory crime reduction program for apartment complexes. Reducing the crime rate at an apartment complex is essential to making the apartment complex safe, sanitary, and fit for human use and habitation.
B.

D.
Community Per Capita Crime Index.
(1)
The chief of police shall calculate on a monthly basis the community per capita crime index for each registered apartment complex in the city.
(2)
The community per capita crime index for an apartment complex is calculated as follows:
(a)
Determine the total number of bedrooms in the apartment complex as designated in the most recent multi-tenant property registration application filed with the director for the property;
(b)
Multiply the number of bedrooms by two (two occupants counted for each bedroom) to produce the ideal occupancy number for the property;
(c)
Multiply the ideal occupancy number by the percent of units in the apartment complex that are occupied (as designated in the most recent multi-tenant property registration application filed with the director for the property) to produce the actual occupancy number;
(d)
Divide the number of Part I crimes occurring on the property within the preceding 12 months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by 100 to produce the community per capita crime index for Part I crimes;
(e)
Divide the number of Part II crimes occurring on the property within the preceding 12 months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by 100 to produce the community per capita crime index for part II crimes.
(f)
Divide the number of Chapter 16 crimes occurring on the property within the preceding 12 months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by 100 to produce the community per capita crime index for Chapter 16 crimes.
_____
(3)
Example of calculation of community per capita crime index.
EXPAND
Apartment size: 100 units
Apartment occupancy rate: 90% occupied
Apartment crime in 12-month period: 10 Part I crimes;
20 Part II crimes;
15 Chapter 16 crimes
Apartment-unit mix: 70 one-bedrooms; 30 two-bedrooms
Total bedrooms 130 (with two occupants counted for each bedroom)
  EXPAND
Ideal occupancy number = 130 x 2 = 260
Actual occupancy number = 260 x 90% = 234
  EXPAND
Crime index for Part I crimes = (10 โก 234) x 100 = 4.3
Crime index for Part II crimes = (20 โก 234) x 100 = 8.5

  E.
Crime Risk Threshold.
(1)
The chief of police shall collectively calculate on a monthly basis the crime risk threshold for all registered apartment complexes in the city.
(2)
The crime risk threshold for apartment complexes is calculated as follows:
(a)
Determine the total number of registered apartment complexes in the city.
(b)
Add together each apartment complex's crime index for Part I crimes and divide the sum by the total number of registered apartment complexes to produce the average crime index for Part I crimes.
(c)
Subtract each apartment complex's crime index for Part I crimes from the average crime index for Part I crimes to get the apartment complex's deviation from the average crime index for Part I crimes.
(d)
Add the square of each apartment complex's deviation from the average crime index for Part I crimes together and divide the sum by the total number of registered apartment complexes to produce the average squared deviation for Part I crimes.
(e)
Take the square root of the average squared deviation for Part I crimes and add it to the average crime index for Part I crimes to produce the crime risk threshold for Part I crimes.
(f)
Repeat the process using each apartment complex's crime index for Part II crimes and Chapter 16 crimes to determine the crime risk threshold for Part II crimes and Chapter 16 crimes, respectively.
(3)
Example of calculation of crime risk threshold.

Apartment Complex No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 SUM
Crime Index for Part I Crimes 12 9 3 10 12 22 7 11 15 19 120
Deviation from Average Crime Index 0 -3 -9 -2 0 10 -5 -1 3 7 0
Deviation Squared 0 9 81 4 0 100 25 1 9 49 278
  Average crime index for Part I crimes = 120 โก 10 = 12
Average squared deviation = 278 โก 10 = 27.8
Standard deviation = โก27.8 = 5.27
Crime risk threshold for Part I crimes = 12 + 5.27 = 17.27
(Note: To calculate the crime risk threshold for Part II crimes and Chapter 16 crimes, repeat the formula using the crime indexes for Part II crimes and then for Chapter 16 crimes.)
