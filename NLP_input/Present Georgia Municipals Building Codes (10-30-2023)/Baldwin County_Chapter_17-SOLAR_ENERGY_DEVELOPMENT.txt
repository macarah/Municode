ARTICLE II. - SOLAR ENERGY DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 17-21. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter/article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Solar energy system means the components and subsystems required to convert solar energy into electric or thermal energy, or to store such energy, including all equipment and accessory buildings.
Solar panel means a photovoltaic device capable of collecting and converting solar energy into electrical energy.
Solar project means a utility-scale, commercial solar energy system, the full size of which occupies five acres or more of land.
( Ord. of 6-16-2020 )
Sec. 17-22. - Jurisdiction and applicability.
This solar energy development ordinance shall apply where any portion of a solar project is, or is proposed to be, sited in any unincorporated area of the county.
( Ord. of 6-16-2020 )
Sec. 17-23. - Standards for solar farms.
(a)
The following minimum setback distances shall be required for all solar energy system components of a solar project (exclusive of fencing and vegetative screening):
(1)
Three hundred feet from all dwelling units, except where the owner of a dwelling unit agrees to lessen such distance by executing a signed written waiver of this requirement;
(2)
One hundred feet from all public right-of-way frontages; and
(3)
Three hundred feet from all property boundaries other than right-of-way frontages, except for:
a.
Property boundaries of adjacent tax parcels that are outside of 500 feet from a residential subdivision or part of a single solar project or a series of commonly owned solar projects must meet a 100-foot setback from all property boundaries other than right-of-way frontages; or
b.
Property boundaries where the owner(s) of the applicable adjacent tax parcel(s) agree to lessen such distance by executing a signed written waiver of this requirement.
(b)
Power inverters and other sound-producing equipment shall be sited no less than 300 feet from any dwelling unit in place at the time of construction or installation.
(c)
All solar energy systems shall be completely enclosed with a minimum of six feet high chain link or security fencing, as measured from the finished grade of the fencing perimeter.
(d)
Where existing visual buffers do not already exist, and at the discretion of the county, solar projects shall be constructed with evergreen vegetative screening or a privacy fence so as to help obscure solar energy system perimeters from dwelling units located within 300 feet of the solar energy system on adjacent parcels. At maturity, the vegetative screening shall be not less than 15 feet tall regardless of line-of-sight.
(e)
Solar energy system height, which shall be measured from the highest finished grade below each solar panel to the top of that panel, shall not exceed and must be maintained at 18 feet.
(f)
Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the ground mounted solar photovoltaic installation and consistent with best practices for the preservation of natural areas or good husbandry of the land or forest.
(g)
Any disturbed land shall be stabilized by a permanent seeding of perennial vegetation such as grass or other dense surface cover that will protect the soil surface from erosion, prevent sediment and runoff at the site from reaching downstream areas, and enhance the aesthetics of the site. It is recommended that a slow-growing, vegetative cover be utilized so that general maintenance of the growth can be kept to a minimum.
(h)
The names of the manufacturers, installers, facility owners, and facility operators, and their addresses and phone numbers shall be posted on the required fencing at each entrance of a solar farm.
(i)
Lighting of a solar farm and its accessory structures shall be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for its safe operation and shall be reasonably shielded from abutting properties. Where feasible, lighting of a solar farm shall be directed downward and shall incorporate full cutoff fixtures to reduce light pollution.
(j)
All solar farms shall comply with Baldwin County ordinances including, but not limited to, setback and height requirements.
(k)
All solar farms shall have a secure entry system at the primary entrance. The secure entry system shall comply with the specifications of the International Fire Code.
(l)
All solar farms shall have a written emergency response plan that shall be approved by the county's code enforcement department, sheriff's office, fire department, and emergency management agency prior to start of operations. Each solar farm shall update its emergency response plan no later than January 1 of each year with a copy provided to all departments and agencies named in this subsection. The emergency response plan shall include the following:
(1)
The phone number, email address, and street address for all manufacturers, installers, owners, and operators; and
(2)
The phone number, email address, and mailing address for a representative of the solar farm responsible for responding to public inquiries; and
(3)
The material safety data sheets that apply to any materials on the solar farm; and
(4)
The clearly marked means and instructions for authorized staff to shut down the solar photovoltaic service.
(m)
Any solar farm that has not been in use for a period of 180 consecutive days for its original purpose as approved by the county code enforcement department shall be deemed abandoned and shall not be authorized to recommence operations until code enforcement inspects the facility unless written notice has been provided to and accepted by code enforcement for nonoperation over 180 days. Code enforcement approval for nonuse over 180 days requires that the facility be maintained as such for future operations.
