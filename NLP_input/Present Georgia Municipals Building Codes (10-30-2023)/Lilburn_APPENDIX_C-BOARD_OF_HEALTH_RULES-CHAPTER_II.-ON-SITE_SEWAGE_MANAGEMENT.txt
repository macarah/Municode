"On-Site Sewage Management System Required"—Where public or community sewage treatment systems are not available, the owner, lessee or agent thereof of every building, residence or property, designed, used or intended to be used for human occupancy or congregation, shall provide an approved on-site sewage management system sufficient for persons normally expected to use or frequent the building, residence or other property for two hours or more. Connection shall be made to a public or community sewage treatment system when such system is available within 200 feet of the property line, or available in a public right-of-way abutting the property. Where a public or community sewage treatment system is to be constructed, or an existing public or community sewer is to be extended to serve a lot, or an approved on-site sewage management system is to be used, the building sewer shall be installed so that it will insure gravity flow at a self-cleaning velocity throughout. If an existing on-site sewage system fails, immediate connection shall be made to a public or community sewage system if such a system is available.
(a)
Any facility that produces a waste stream with BOD 5 (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and TSS (total suspended solids) higher than 200 mg/L shall be required to pretreat the waste to reduce the BOD 5 and TSS to 200 mg/L or below before disposal through a conventional or chamber septic tank system.
(2)
"On-Site Sewage Management System Construction Permit Required"—No person may begin the physical development of a lot or structure thereon, where an on-site sewage management system will be utilized, nor install an on-site sewage management system or component thereof without having first applied for and obtained from the county health department a construction permit for the installation.

"Requirements for On-Site Sewage Management System Construction Permit Issuance or Denial"—On-site sewage management system construction permits shall be issued only after a site inspection by the county board of health shows favorable findings relative to absorption rates, soil characteristics, groundwater, rock and any other factors which would affect the acceptability of the lot. No construction permit for an on-site sewage management system shall be issued prior to the approval of the public water supply system, where a public water supply system is to be utilized. Lot suitability and approval is to be determined by the criteria established by the department's current Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems.
Lots shall be sized according to the regulations of the county board of health. The county board of health may deny or revoke an on-site sewage management system construction permit upon finding the lot unsuitable or for failure of the applicant to comply with the provisions of these rules.

Removal or alteration of system components after final inspection by the county board of health shall render the approval void.
(5)
"Design Limits for Conventional or Chamber Septic Tank Systems"—To provide for the maintenance of sanitary conditions through the proper functioning of a conventional or chamber septic tank system for a reasonable period of time, no such system may be installed, constructed, or used, having a septic tank design capacity of less than 1,000 gallons or greater than 10,000 gallons, or where the total length of absorption trenches required would exceed 3,000 linear feet, or where the total absorption trench bottom area required would exceed 9,000 square feet.
(6)
"Submission of Plans, Specifications, and Soil Data"—Plans, specifications, soil data and, if required, absorption test data, submitted to the county board of health for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit to install an on-site sewage management system, which will produce a sewage flow in excess of 2,000 gallons per day, shall bear the registration number and signature of a Registered Professional Engineer, certified and registered under the laws of this State. The county board of health may accept plans, specifications, soil data, and absorption test data for facilities with sewage flow of 2,000 gallons or less per day, when prepared in accordance with these rules, from any person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the county board of health that they have sufficient knowledge of on-site sewage management system design.
(7)

When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank.
(6)
"Foundation and Backfill"—Septic tanks will be constructed or installed level, on a foundation that will prevent settling; backfill shall be placed so that a stable fill results and undue strain on the tank is avoided. Earth backfill shall be free of voids, large stones, stumps, broken masonry, or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is recommended. With proper documentation the county board of health may approve less cover. All openings and manholes shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of surface water.

(A)
The department shall review absorption field products that differ in design from the conventional on-site sewage management system. The following standards will be used to determine equivalency to the conventional on-site sewage management system.
1.
The design infiltrative surface is the wetted trench bottom area.
2.
Due to the combined effects of compaction, contact area and fines associated with gravel aggregate, the effective infiltrative surface area is reduced by an estimated 50%.
3.
The minimum amount of effective trench bottom infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system.
4.
Sidewall area shall not be considered for design reduction. The minimum amount of effective sidewall infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system.
5.
The minimum storage volume required for a system shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system.
6.
The design absorption area required is based on the most hydraulically limiting soil horizon that comes into contact with the infiltrative surface of the sidewall, trench bottom and for a distance one foot below the absorption trench bottom.
Infiltration area for conventional 36-inch wide gravel trench absorption
Sidewall Infiltration Area: 2 sq. ft./ft × .50 = 1 sq.ft./linear foot
Trench Bottom Infiltration Area: 3 sq. ft./ft × .50 = 1.5 sq.ft./linear foot
Storage Volume: 3 cubic feet/linear foot × 7.48 gallons/cubic foot × .35 = 7.85 gallons/linear foot
(B)
Prior Approval: Lots approved for development based on a reduction in absorption trench length up to 50% shall continued to be approved and permitted for up to a 50% reduction in absorption trench length provided the lot is part of a recorded plat or part of a preliminary development plan submitted to the county board of health within one year of rule adoption.
