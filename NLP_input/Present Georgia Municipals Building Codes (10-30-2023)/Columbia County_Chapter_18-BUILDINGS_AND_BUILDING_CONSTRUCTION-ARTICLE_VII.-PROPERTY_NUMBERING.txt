Editor's note— Ord. No. 13-06, adopted Dec. 3, 2013, repealed the former Art. VII, §§ 18-242—18-244, and enacted a new Art. VII as set out herein. The former Art. VII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 00-14, §§ 2-5-51—2-5-53, adopted Dec. 19, 2000. Ord. No. 13-06 states "Violations of this article shall be subject to penalties as outlined in section 1-9 of this Code.

Sec. 18-242. - Purpose and administration.
(a)
The primary purpose of this article is to enable rapid response to citizens and location of properties by law enforcement, fire, rescue, and emergency medical service personnel in Columbia County. Secondarily, this article serves to establish standardization of structure numbering to enhance county records of utility service, construction, permitting, licensing, and valuation.
(b)
This article shall be administered by the individual/individuals, who shall be designated by the deputy county administrator, referred to herein as the "agency". The designated agent shall assign property numbers in accordance with the criteria outlined in chapter 18, article VII of the Code of Ordinances of Columbia County, Georgia (the "Code"). The agency will be responsible for maintaining official records of this article including, but not limited to, an alphabetical list of all roads with properties, listed in order of their assigned numbers.
(Ord. No. 13-06, 12-3-2013)
Sec. 18-243. - System of numbering.
(a)
All properties, lots, and parcels of land shall hereafter be identified by reference to the numbering system adopted herein, except that all existing number identification of buildings or lots or parcels not in conformity with this system shall be changed within (6) months from the adoption of this article so as to conform.
(b)
The agency shall invite the involvement of the residents of affected areas in determining modified street numbers by public notice of such intent. However, nothing in this chapter shall be considered to usurp authority of the agency to make final decisions regarding the numbering system, numbers assigned, or compliance with this chapter without public involvement.
(c)
Numbers shall be assigned along both sides of the road, with even numbers appearing on the left side of the road and odd numbers appearing on the right side of the road in the ascending direction.
(d)
The following criteria shall govern the numbering system:
(1)
All number origins shall begin from the intersection of the primary or secondary through or cross street. For dead-end roads or subdivision cul-de-sacs, numbering shall originate at the intersection of the adjacent road and terminate at the dead-end.
(2)
The number assigned to the primary structure shall be the same number assigned to the real property in which the structure is situated.
(3)
Every structure with more than one principle use or occupancy shall have a separate number for each use or occupancy. For example, duplexes will have two separate numbers.
(4)
Apartments will have one property number followed by an apartment number based on the building number and apartment location within the building. For example, following the property number, building number one will be addressed with a one prefixing the apartment number, for example, 475 Belair Road, Apt. 101.
(5)
On those streets accessed from either end, the property numbers shall originate from the end of the street carrying the greatest traffic volume.
(6)
Notwithstanding the above, streets with the same name continuing into Columbia County from another municipality shall be numbered consistently based on beginning with the next consecutive number following the last number within the other municipality as feasible.
(7)
Whenever any residence or other structure is constructed or developed, it shall be the responsibility of the new owner to obtain an assigned number from the agency. An assigned number shall be required prior to issuance of the building permit. In new subdivision developments, no numeric address shall be assigned prior to final plat approval by the Columbia County Planning Commission. Numbers shall be assigned and recorded on the final plat.
(Ord. No. 13-06, 12-3-2013)
Sec. 18-244. - Compliance.
(a)
Numbers should be displayed as follows:
(1)
For single family residential structures, numbers shall be posted using street line posting as described below.
(2)
For multi-family residential structures, numbers shall be posted using structure posting as described below.
(3)
For commercial structures, numbers shall be posted using both street line posting and structure posting.
(b)
All owners of structures shall, within the time-frame stipulated herein, display and maintain the assigned numbers in a conspicuous place on or near said structure in the following manner:
(1)
Street line posting: The assigned number shall be displayed on a post, fence, wall, mailbox, or on some other structure with an approximate height of four feet at the property line adjacent to the access drive of the numbered structure. The exact height and location of the posting may vary in order to ensure that the sign remains unobstructed from view. The posted numbers shall be visible from both directions on the road.
(2)
Structure posting: The assigned number shall be displayed on the front of the structure within five feet of the front door and visible from the road where practical.
(3)
Size and color of numbers: Properties used for residential purposes shall have posted numbers a minimum of three inches high. Commercial properties shall have posted numbers a minimum of four inches high. All numbers shall be a contrasting color to their background. Structure signs and mounting poles meeting these specifications are available for a fee from the Columbia County Fire and Rescue Division Headquarters.
(4)
Any number aside from the assigned number shall be removed from the structure, mailbox, post or stanchion, to prevent confusion with the number assigned in conformance with this article. No person, agency, or business shall adopt, assign, display, or cite any number other than that assigned as provided herein for the purpose of designating location of property.
(5)
In residential instances where the property is located on a private drive where more than one residence is located, the assigned number must be posted on the main road. It must also be posted adjacent to the access drive of the property using the street line posting.
(6)
In situations where a property is located on a private drive and has more than one structure or a structure with more than one principle use or occupancy, numbers should be posted using the structure posting, in addition to the posting requirements of subsection (5), set forth above.
(7)
The owner, occupant, or person in charge of any house or building to which a number is assigned or modified shall be notified in writing of that assignment at any time after adoption of this article.
(8)
Notices provided herein shall seek to govern or regulate the placing of assigned numbers as prescribed by the United States Postal Service.
