It is the intent of this UDO that all buildings, structures, and uses of land shall provide off-street vehicular and bicycle parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are readily useable for such purposes.

When a change is proposed to a building that is nonconforming as to parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition.
(c)
No addition or change of use to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area, or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein.
(d)
The parking lot shall not be modified, enlarged, relocated or expanded in a manner that violates any portion of this UDO.
(e)
No parking area may be used for the sale, repair, dismantling, servicing or long-term storage of any vehicles or equipment, unless such use is permitted by the zoning district in which the area is located.
