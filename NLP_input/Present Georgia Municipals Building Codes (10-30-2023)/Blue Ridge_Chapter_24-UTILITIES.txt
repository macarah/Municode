(Code 1979, § 20-103; Code 2003, § 52.03)
Sec. 24-96. - Tapping charge.
(a)
Upon the application for a new tap and service connection by any consumer within the corporate limits of the city, the applicant shall pay to the city clerk a sum as designated by the city council from time to time to cover the cost of the fittings, installation of the tap by the city and the necessary pipe from the main to the curb box.
(b)
On application for a new tap and service connection by any consumer outside the corporate limits of the city, the applicant shall pay to the city clerk a sum as designated by the city council from time to time to cover the cost of the fittings, installation of the tap by the city and the necessary pipe from the main to the curb box.

(e)
The city council, based upon evidence of a recycling system to be installed by the applicant, may reduce the amount of the water connection (or tap) fee to a water connection fee for a smaller line, with the city council making the determination as to the amount of the reduced water connection fee based upon the anticipated reduced water volume usages due to the proposed recycling system. However, should the applicant not install or actually use a recycling system, then the applicant must pay the standard water connection fee as determined by the size of the water line actually installed less a credit for the reduced connection fee previously paid. Further, should the recycling system not reduce the total water volume usage of applicant as anticipated, then the city may also assess an additional water connection fee reflecting the total water usage of applicant and the size of the line actually installed. Failure of applicant to pay the additional or reassessed water connection fee shall entitle the city to terminate service to applicant.

The service deposit for the normal three-fourths inch in diameter residential line (which includes either an owner-occupied residence or a rental or tenant residence) shall be in the amount as determined by the mayor and council from time to time. Any applicant requesting a residential water line above the normal three-fourths inch in diameter water line shall pay a service deposit according to the service deposits charged for the same size line for a commercial or industrial use, unless said service deposit is reduced by official action taken by the city council. The service deposit for commercial or industrial (including, but not limited to, a townhome or apartment complex) shall be based upon the size of the water line which in turn necessitates the size of the water meter, and shall be in amounts as determined by the mayor and council from time to time. Water meter deposits for water lines above two inches in diameter shall be as established by the mayor and council, based upon the recommendation of the director of public works.
(b)
All commercial buildings, trailer parks, apartment houses, duplexes, rental houses and houses or trailers located on property on which there is another house or trailer must have a water meter for each unit or tenant.

Upon payment of all charges owed by the consumer/customer to the city, including any water or sewer charges, garbage charges, ad valorem taxes, occupational license fees, and any and all other charges and assessments owned by the consumer/customer to the city, then upon termination of service, and upon the return by the customer/consumer of any property that is owned by the city, the city shall return the deposit to the customer/consumer. (It is the intent of the city council that any deposit held by the city as to a customer may be used to pay any type of charge, assessment, tax, or fee owed by the customer to the city.)

(c)
All cost and expense incident to the connection of the building sewer from the owner's building to the closest sewer transmission line of the city shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may be directly or indirectly occasioned by the connection of the building sewer. The applicant shall pay to the city a sewer tapping fee or connection charge as designed and set by the city council of the city from time to time to cover the cost of connection to the city's sewer system. The city shall own and maintain the city's sewer transmission line, but the property owner shall own and maintain the service line from the owner's building to the city's sewer transmission line. All connections to the sewer transmission line of the city must be inspected by a designated agent of the city and approved (unless performed by the city or its employees).
(1)
The city council, based upon evidence of a recycling system to be installed by the applicant, may reduce the amount of the sewer connection (or tap) fee, to a sewer connection fee for a smaller line, with the city council making the determination as to the amount of the reduced sewer connection fee based upon the anticipated reduced water volume usages due to the proposed recycling system.
(2)
However, should applicant not install or actually use a recycling system, then applicant must pay the standard sewer connection fee as determined by the size of the water line actually installed, less a credit for the reduced sewer connection fee paid.
(3)
Further, should the recycling system not reduce the total water volume usage of applicant and subsequent sewage discharge as anticipated, then the city may also assess an additional sewer connection fee reflecting the total water usage of applicant and subsequent sewage discharge.
(4)
Failure of applicant to pay the additional or reassessed sewer connection fee shall entitle the city to terminate service to applicant.
(d)
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building, except where one building stands at the rear of another or on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.

The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot.
(h)
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fittings.
(i)
In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity to flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
(j)
All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work, unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and back fill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, except that no back fill shall be placed until the work has been inspected.

(5)
Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval of the superintendent.
(l)
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall install a "Y" branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the superintendent. Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located "Y" is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of 45 degrees. A 45 degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent.

ARTICLE V. - DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN

Sec. 24-158. - Drought condition indicators.
The system for determining drought severity based on an approved indicator is as follows: The city's source of water is the Toccoa River, and the intake is located approximately 1,000 feet downstream from the Blue Ridge Dam and Reservoir. Both the river flow and reservoir level are monitored on a regular basis by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which posts the data on its website. The city will monitor the TVA website on a scheduled basis. The total supply needed for the city (6.0 mgd) is less than ten percent of the river's 7Q10 at the intake point (approximately 103 mgd). Therefore, the possibility of drought that would limit the necessary supply for the city is remote. The Blue Ridge WTP also has a raw water reservoir with a capacity of approximately 2.0 mg, which provides a small quantity of emergency storage of raw water.

Sec. 24-159. - Potable water use priorities program.
(a)
The city has adopted the priority schedule recommended by the state, as follows:
(1)
Emergency facilities for essential life support measures.
(2)
Domestic and personal uses, including drinking, cooking, washing, sanitary, and health-related uses.
(3)
Farm uses.
(4)
Industrial uses.
(5)
Other uses, such as lawn sprinkling, noncommercial car washing, garden watering, etc.
(6)
Outdoor recreational uses.
(b)
Conditions or events that put priority use system into effect include the following:
(1)
The state issues an order to do so.
(2)
The Toccoa River level drops below the critical level determined to be an indicator of a drought condition.
(3)
The Blue Ridge Reservoir level drops below the critical level determined to be an indicator of a drought condition.
(c)
Adopted priority use system for service during periods of water shortages.
(1)
The city has adopted the priority schedule recommended by the state described in subsection (a) of this section.
(2)
The city has adopted the Outdoor Water Use Rules of GA EPD, Chapter 391-3-30, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
(3)
The city has published a drought contingency plan that outlines its response to a water shortage due to drought conditions.
(d)
Restrictions on lower priority uses (including enforcement procedures).
(1)
Subsection (c) of this section states that the city has adopted and published its drought contingency plan.
(2)
The city will use enforcement actions that are allowed by state law and are appropriate for the violation of its drought contingency plan.
(e)
Rationing and/or other emergency procedures. The city would initiate a response similar to that in any other emergency that impacted the city's ability to deliver an adequate, safe supply of water.
(Res. No. 2007-05-12, § 2, 6-12-2007)
Sec. 24-160. - Low flow protection.
(a)
Withdrawal by the city for its water treatment will not deplete the instream, minimum flow established for its source water, the Toccoa River.
(b)
The minimum flow for the Toccoa River has been determined by TVA to be its 7Q10 flow, which is 103 mgd.
(c)
Low flow monitoring by the city will include:
(1)
Monitoring by the minimum flow of the Toccoa River as measured and reported by TVA on its website.
(2)
Monitoring the minimum level of the Blue Ridge Reservoir as measured and reported by TVA on its website.
(Res. No. 2007-05-12, § 3, 6-12-2007)
Sec. 24-161. - Water shortage to ensure availability of raw water during critical drought period.
The city's maximum withdrawal from the Toccoa River is proposed to be 6.0 mgd, whereas the minimum flow (7Q10 flow) in the Toccoa River at the point of withdrawal is 103 mgd, according to TVA. Therefore, this source of raw water should be very reliable during all expected drought periods. However, the city will also investigate the possibility of interconnecting with other water suppliers wherever and when possible in order to provide an additional level of protection for its drinking water customers in the event of an emergency event, including a record drought.
