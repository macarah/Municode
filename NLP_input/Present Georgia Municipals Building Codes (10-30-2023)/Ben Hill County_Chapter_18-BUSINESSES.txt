For grievances regarding the occupation tax assessed or the major line of business classification, the aggrieved person or entity shall first submit in writing to the county manager a complaint which shall set forth in reasonable detail the matters complained of.

The written reply shall state in reasonable detail the basis for the decision regarding the initial assessment and classification. Should the aggrieved person or entity desire to seek review of such a decision, or if the county manager fails to issue a written opinion to the taxpayer within the 30-calendar-day time period, the taxpayer shall be entitled to appeal to the board of commissioners pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 18-126.
(Ord. No. 2-2009, § 1(18-124(2)), 2-2009)
Sec. 18-126. - Administration; procedure for grievances and appeals.
The county manager shall administer and enforce the provisions of this article. Should an aggrieved person or entity desire to appeal a decision under this article, the following procedures shall apply:
(1)
A notice of appeal must be filed with the county manager within ten calendar days after receipt of the decision complained of. The notice of appeal shall be in the form of a letter, and shall clearly identify all of the objections or exceptions taken to the decision of the county manager. The notice shall also contain an address for receipt of future notices and decisions of the board of commissioners. Should the aggrieved person or entity fail to file a notice of appeal within the allowed time, the right to appeal is lost and the temporary decision of the county manager shall become permanent.
(2)
Upon receipt of a timely and proper notice of appeal, the county manager shall notify the appellant, in writing, of the date, time and place where a hearing will be held. The hearing shall be held before the board of commissioners at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners following the date of appellant filing said notice of appeal with the county manager, unless otherwise decided by the board of commissioners. The county manager shall transmit to the board of commissioners all documents or materials constituting the record of the action or proceedings of this section.
(3)
If the county manager deems it necessary that an audit of the financial books/records of appellant be conducted, the county shall notify the appellant in writing of a reasonable date, time and place for the audit, which shall be conducted prior to the date of a hearing on the matter. The county manager may hire outside auditors for this purpose. The expense of hiring outside auditors shall be borne by the county if the position of the appellant is sustained by the audit. If not, the expense of the outside auditors shall be due and payable from appellant as part of the costs of appeal.
(4)
An appeal under this section shall stay all legal proceedings with regard to collection of the occupation tax from an appellant; however, such appeal shall not preclude the county from pursuing legal proceedings to enjoin any violation of this article or of any other section of this Code.
(5)
Appeals before the board of commissioners. In all hearings pursuant to this section, the following procedures shall prevail, and the proceeding shall be as informal as compatible with justice:
a.
The board of commissioners shall be convened and shall, for purposes of hearing appeals of adverse actions pursuant to this section, also be known as the certificate review board.

Any alleged violations or misconduct levied against the appellant and scheduled for a hearing before the certificate review board shall be read completely to the appellant at the commencement of the hearing, unless waived by the appellant.
d.
The certificate review board may receive evidence in support of the alleged violations or misconduct as filed against the appellant. Decisions of the certificate review board are to be supported by the evidence accepted and admitted during the hearing.
e.
The county shall bear the burden of proof. The standard of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.
f.
The order of proof shall be as follows: The county representative shall present the case-in-chief in support of the alleged violations or misconduct; the appellant may present a case-in-chief, if desired. Each party may be allowed to present one case-in-rebuttal.
g.
The appellant and county may be represented by counsel, may present evidence, and may examine and cross examine witnesses. Additionally, members of the certificate review board are permitted to question witnesses. A party is permitted to no more than 15 minutes to present that party's case-in-chief; a case-in-chief in rebuttal is permitted no more than ten minutes of presentation. Presentation of arguments and evidence may be in oral or written form, except that affidavits of individuals who are unavailable for cross examination shall not be accepted or admitted by the certificate review board nor considered by the board.
h.
Following the presentation of evidence, the board shall issue a written decision within 30 calendar days of the date of the hearing. A copy of the decision shall be mailed, via registered or certified mail, to the parties or the parties' representatives. For the appellant, the decision shall be mailed to the address provided on the notice of appeal. Should the certificate review board fail to issue a timely decision, on the 31st day after the hearing, the appellant may seek review as if a decision adverse to the appellant has been rendered.
i.
The findings of the certificate review board shall be final unless a party files a petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county within 30 calendar days of the decision of the certificate review board.
