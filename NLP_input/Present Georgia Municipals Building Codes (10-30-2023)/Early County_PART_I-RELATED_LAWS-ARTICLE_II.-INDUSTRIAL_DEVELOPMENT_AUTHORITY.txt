Editor's note— Printed herein is 1968 Ga. Laws, page 1608, which amended the state constitution to provide for the Early County Industrial Development Authority. The constitutional amendment creating such development authority was continued in force and effect by 1986 Ga. Laws, page 4618. Amendments to the Act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.
