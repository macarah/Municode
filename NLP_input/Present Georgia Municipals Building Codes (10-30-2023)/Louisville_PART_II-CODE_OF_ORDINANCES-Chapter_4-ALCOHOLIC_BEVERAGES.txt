(b)

At the hearing, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, have an attorney, and have testimony recorded at his expense.

The decision of the city council shall be final unless appealed within 30 days from the date of the finding by certiorari to the county superior court.
(d)
Due cause. Due cause may be found by the city council in any of the following circumstances:
(1)
Due cause for the suspension, revocation or denial of the renewal or transfer of any license shall consist of an act or omission found to be by the city council, after a hearing as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, or for the violation of any state or federal law, or for the violation of any city ordinances, other than traffic violations or ordinances, or for the failure of the licensee or his employee to promptly report to the police department any violation of the law or ordinance breach of peace, disturbance or altercation, resulting in violence occurring inside the premises.
(2)
Due cause may also be found should the licensed establishment have become a "trouble spot" in the judgment of the city council by reason of disturbances or acts of disorderly conduct or violence having occurred in the establishment or on the premises thereof, provided that when the license of any establishment has been revoked or renewal of license denied because such establishment has become a "trouble spot," no further license shall be issued under this article to any person at such location for a period of at least 12 months from the date of revocation.
(3)
Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof, or the owner or any person connected therewith, ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this article.
(4)
Due cause may also be found upon the revelation of any false statement or material misrepresentation in any application hereunder. Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information that is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license.
(5)
Due cause may also consist of the failure of the licensee to control the operation either inside the building or outside on the property which failure results in controlled substance abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the city council, after a proper hearing, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance.
(e)
Discontinuance of sale. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or his employee to cooperate with any police officer on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all policy powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the police chief shall immediately order all sales of any alcoholic beverages suspended until after a hearing as set out in the due cause hearing provided for in of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate.
(f)
Refund of license fee. When a license is revoked or suspended, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license fee.
(g)
Effect of revocation by state. When the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell any alcoholic beverage at retail, the city license to deal in such product shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the city council or any municipal officer. If the state has suspended the license or placed the same on probation, then the city license is automatically suspended or probated, as the case may be.
(h)
Emergency situation. The mayor is the delegated authority to suspend any license hereunder in any emergency situation, and the suspension may be made effective immediately and remain in force until the next regular or called meeting of the city council.
