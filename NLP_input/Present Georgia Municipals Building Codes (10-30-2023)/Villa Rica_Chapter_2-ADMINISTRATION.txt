(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.050), 8-4-2015)
Sec. 2-109. - Ethics.
It is the policy of the city to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the city finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the city. The city will set up and conduct a procurement program that maximizes service benefit to the community and awards contracts to vendors who offer the best value.
(1)
The city declares that city employees and officials along with those wishing to do business with the city have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition.
(2)
The purchasing agent and every officer and employee of the city whose duties involve the purchase or sale of goods and/or services, or the preparation of specifications for the purchase of goods and/or services for the city, or deciding which goods shall be declared surplus are expressly prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value, directly or indirectly, from any person, company, firm or corporation which seeks to do business with or contract with the city or has contracted with the city within the preceding 12 months, or to which any purchase order or contract is awarded, or to whom any surplus goods may be sold.
(3)
Prospective vendors must compete for city business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction.
(4)
The city's ethics regulations, as set forth in article VI of this chapter, and the city Charter should be consulted for requirements related to lobbying and representation of business interests that come before the city council or city officials for decision.
(5)
Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the city seeks to establish relationships with business partners whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. The purchasing agent is charged with establishing methods for ongoing monitoring for non-compliance with these principles. The prohibition against the offering of or the acceptance of gifts, favors, kickbacks, gratuities, payments or any other thing of value extends beyond and outside any specific procurement or solicitation.
(6)
A vendor's contract compliance history with the city and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation.
(7)
The city stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The city manager is authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the city's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the city's goals.
(8)
City employees, officials, and their family members are generally prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of undue advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner.
(9)
It is unethical for any city employee to purchase commodities or services from a city contract for personal use.
(10)
Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a city contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any city officer, elected official, employee or other city representative other than the purchasing agent named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the city council. The city manager and budget officer will review violations. If it is determined that such communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified from consideration for award.
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.060), 8-4-2015)
Sec. 2-110. - Disclaimer of responsibility for improper purchasing.
The city council may disclaim responsibility and liability for any purchase, expenditure, or agreement for expenditure arising from procurement made in its name, or in the name of any governmental body under its authority, by an unauthorized person or any person acting outside this article or the authorization or delegation as provided in this article. The expense of any such disclaimed transaction will become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly.
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.061), 8-4-2015)
Sec. 2-111. - Evasion prohibited.
No purchase or sale shall be artificially divided for the purpose of evading the provisions of this article. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts.
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.070), 8-4-2015)
Sec. 2-112. - Summary of methods of procurement.
In most cases, this article recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used:
(1)
Informal purchase. Those purchases $10,000.00 or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals.
(2)
Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met:
a.
Clear and adequate specifications are available.
b.
Three or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process.
c.
Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00.
d.
Revenue is greater than $10,000.00.
(3)
Competitive sealed proposal. When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
a.
Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services.
b.
Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest.
c.
Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous.
d.
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
e.
Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00.
f.
Revenue is greater than $10,000.00.
(4)
Sole source purchase. A sole source procurement may be used when only one vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurements or by approval of the city manager, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. The city council shall approve all purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00.
(5)
Emergency purchase. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time. Acquisitions shall be made using such competitive procedures as circumstances reasonably permit. Emergencies shall be documented by the using department and submitted to the purchasing office. When a situation exists where time does not permit the involvement of the purchasing office, the user department director is authorized to purchase necessary commodities or make necessary repairs. For emergencies where cost exceeds the amount authorized to a using department, written documentation shall be prepared by the user department director and submitted to the purchasing office explaining the nature of the emergency. All emergencies where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 require ratification of the city council.
(6)
Cooperative purchase. The city may participate in a cooperative purchase for commodities, supplies and services when determined that it is in the best interest of the city. The sponsoring entity, whether federal, state or local must have performed a competitive procurement process and entered into a contract that stipulates allowance for other governmental entities to purchase from the supplier at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as extended to it. If such arrangement has not been made a part of the contract, written permission from the sponsoring entity and the awarded supplier must be obtained. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Cooperative purchases where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council.
(7)
Governmental and affiliated entity purchase. The city may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and nonprofit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the city. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Such purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council.
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.080), 8-4-2015)
Sec. 2-113. - Mandatory pre-qualification process.
(a)
Public works construction contracts governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 et seq. The purchasing agent is hereby delegated the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f).
(b)
All other contracts. The purchasing agent is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to these requirements:
(1)
Criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work.
(2)
Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information.
(3)
There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification.
(4)
There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder to respond to his disqualification to the purchasing agent; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal.
(5)
No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened.
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.082), 8-4-2015)
Sec. 2-114. - Purchases based on informal procurement.
(a)
Generally. Procurements that involve amounts $10,000.00 or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the city.
(b)
Prohibition of improper use of informal purchase process. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals.
(c)
Procedures. Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the purchasing agent. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction.
(d)
Types of informal purchases. Informal purchases are classified by two categories:
(1)
Those that may be made directly by the using department.
(2)
Those that are required to be made through the central procurement process.
(e)
Informal purchase by user departments.
(1)
Authority. Each user department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director or city manager, to handle purchases where the cost is less than $2,500.00.
(2)
Prohibition of misuse. Purchases may not be artificially divided in order to qualify for handling by the using departments. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts.
(f)
Informal purchases by purchasing staff.
(1)
Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through telephone solicitations where the cost is $2,500.00 or less. A minimum of three quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available.
(2)
Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through written quotations where the cost is $2,500.00 to $10,000.00. A minimum of three written quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available.
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.090), 8-4-2015)

A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the city.

(e)
Modification of bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described in this subsection, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing agent determines the correction to be in the city's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening:
(1)
Price information.
(2)
Any required bonding.
(f)
Withdrawal of bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following:
(1)
The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure.
(2)
Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if a request is made to withdraw the bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
(g)
Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation.
(h)
Bid cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or, as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file.

(2)

(3)
Rejection or deferral of bid. The purchasing agent may reject bids, or may defer bid awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review of bids or for other business purposes, consistent with the best interest of the city.

If both or neither of the tied bidders are local vendors, the purchasing staff shall request the firm's best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid.
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.100), 8-4-2015)
Sec. 2-116. - Competitive sealed proposals.
(a)
Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00.
