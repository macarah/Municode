[Sec.] 16.12.120. - Improvements required.
A.
Required. Every subdivider shall be required to install or to have installed by the appropriate agency at his expense the following street improvements and utilities:
1.
Except where waived on major or limited access streets by provisions of this or other ordinances, provide street grading, curbs and gutters, and street paving; provided that on a parkway, curb and gutter may be waived adjacent to the median or on the outside edges of the pavement or both, where hydrologic analysis indicates that the design storm specified by the city will be absorbed in the median or in rights-of-way outside the pavement without erosion damage or harm to landscaping, aesthetics, or the public health or safety.
2.
Provide water lines and fire hydrants, sanitary sewer lines and manholes, sidewalks (when determined by the planning commission to be essential for the safety of pedestrians), and monuments and markers.
3.
Provide storm drainage facilities, including catchbasins, junction boxes, and storm sewer lines discharging directly into existing storm sewers or continuous streams. (Discharge to overland flow, artificial channels, or intermittent streams—normally flowing only in direct response to precipitation—is not permitted.) Where no such discharge points for a particular drainage basin exist within the boundary of the property to be developed, discharge to intermittent streams may occur at or within ten (10) feet of such boundary. Where necessary because of inadequate capacity in existing facilities, erosion problems, or adverse impact on adjoining property, detention structures or energy-dissipation structures shall be provided.
4.
On townhouse and attached-dwelling lots, provide for underground service for electric power, telephones, cable television and similar services. No overhead service will be permitted.
B.
Standards. The foregoing street improvements, utilities and monuments shall be built to the standards specified by the agency responsible for each.
C.
Completion. The city council's certificate necessary for final plat approval shall not be granted until:
1.
All improvements required in subsection A have been completed; or
2.
All improvements required in subsections A.2 and A.3 of this section and all street grading, curbs and gutters, and street base have been completed; and
3.
A bond has been deposited with the city clerk for any required improvements not yet completed or for any necessary minor repairs or minor changes to improvements already in place.
All improvements must be completed within nine months after approval of the final plat. Upon final acceptance of all improvements, funds in such deposit or account shall be returned to the depositor.
D.
Public Improvements Bond. Where improvements constructed by a private developer are to be dedicated to the public, the developer shall, upon completion of construction, provide a bond to assure the structural durability, stability, and integrity of the improvements for one year from the date of acceptance by the city. Upon determination after one year that durability, stability, and integrity requirements have been met, the bond shall be released or returned to the depositor. As an alternative to providing a bond for one year, the developer may submit documentation by an engineering testing firm acceptable to the city, certifying that subgrade conditions, construction, and materials meet the city's standards. The certification shall be based on the level of testing specified by the city.
(Prior Code, § 16.12.120; Ord. No. 668, § SR3-12, 5-13-1996)

B.
External Boundaries. The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented. These monuments shall be placed at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any line, and at all angle points along the meander line, such points to be not less than twenty (20) feet back from the bank of any stream, except that when such corners or points fall within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments shall be placed in the side line of the street.
C.
Internal Boundaries. All internal boundaries and those corners and points not referred to in subsection B of this section shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes at least seven-eighths inch in diameter or by iron bars at least one-half inch in diameter. These monuments shall be placed at all lot corners, at each end of all curves, at a point where a curve changes its radius, and at all angle points in any line.
D.
Lines Extending to Streams. The lines of lots that extend to streams shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes at least seven-eights inch in diameter or by iron bars at least one-half inch in diameter.

1.
For corner lots, or those lots having multiple street frontages, an address shall be assigned for each street meeting the minimum required street frontage. The person who constructs a building or structure on a corner lot shall designate a street number on the building permit from among the numbers assigned on the final plat. All other permits issued for the corner lot shall identify this number as the street address.
2.
The driveway and mailbox shall be located onto the street assigned the number on the final plat. If in the opinion of the director the driveway leading to the building or structure is moved to the extent that the number no longer corresponds to the street number provided on the final plat, the final plat must be modified. No inspection shall be made under these circumstances and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the final plat is modified.
B.
Building numbering.
1.
Assigning numbers. Street numbers for the addressing system shall be assigned for all buildings and structures. Numbers must be erected and displayed in front of the project on a board with permanent numbers not smaller than two inches. Numbers must be in place at the beginning of the job before the footing inspection is made and must correspond to the address provided on building permit. The number shall be continuously displayed thereafter until the job is complete and all final inspections have been made. No inspection will be made where street numbers are not in place as required above.
2.
Designation of street numbers. Street numbers for dwelling units and places of business on all public streets and street numbers or building numbers for dwelling units and places of business within apartment projects and nonresidential developments located on private streets shall be assigned by the City Clerk or designee in accordance with administrative procedures.
