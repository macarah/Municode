Basic distance rate means the maximum charge for distance for all intervals except the initial interval.
Basic time rate means the maximum charge for time for all intervals except the initial interval.
Cleared means a taximeter is inoperative with respect to all fare indication, when no indication of fare or extras is shown and when all parts are in those positions in which they are designed to be when the vehicle on which the taximeter is installed is not engaged by a passenger.
Extras means charges to be paid by a passenger in addition to the fare, including any charge for the transportation of baggage.
Face means that side of a taximeter upon which passenger charges are indicated.
Fare means that portion of the charge for the hire of a taxicab that is automatically calculated by a taximeter through the operation of the distance or time mechanism. Any fares shall be the maximum fare which may be charged, but which shall not prohibit lower amounts being charged.
Fifth wheel test means a distance test similar to a road test except that the distance traveled by the vehicle under test is determined by a mechanism known as a "fifth wheel" that is attached to the vehicle and that independently measures and indicates the distance.
Flag means a plate at the end of the lever arm or similar part by which the operating condition of a taximeter is controlled.
Hired means a taximeter that is operative with respect to all applicable indications of fare or extras. The indications of fare include time and distance where applicable unless qualified by another indication of the term "time not recording" or an equivalent expression.
Initial distance of time interval means the interval corresponding to the initial money drop.
Money drop means an increment of fare indication. The initial money drop is the first increment of fare indication following activation of the taximeter.
Multiple-tariff taximeter means one that may be set to calculate fares at any one of two or more rates.
Road test means a distance test, over a measured course, of a complete taximeter assembly when installed on a vehicle, the mechanism being actuated as a result of vehicle travel.
Rolling circumference means the straight line distance traveled per revolution of the wheel that actuates the taximeter. If more than one wheel actuates the taximeter, the rolling circumference is the average distance traveled per revolution of the wheels.
Simulated road test means a distance test during which the taximeter may be actuated by some means other than road travel. The distance traveled is either measured by a properly calibrated roller device or computed from rolling circumference and wheel-turn data.
Single-tariff taximeter means one that calculates fares at a single rate only.
Subsequent distance or time intervals means the intervals corresponding to money drops following the initial money drop.
Taximeter means a device that automatically calculates, at a predetermined rate, and indicates the fares based upon distance, time and mileage. Taxicabs operating with nonelectronic taximeters shall be furnished with a sign approved by the department immediately adjacent to the taximeter which explains the way the fare shall be calculated if the taximeter reaches its highest fare before the passenger's destination is reached.

iii.
Visibility of indications. Except when a taximeter is being cleared, indications of fare and extras shall be clearly visible at all times and at least ten mm high for the fare and four mm high for all other indications.
iv.
Actuation of fare-indicating mechanism. When a taximeter designed to calculate fares upon the basis of a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed is operative with respect to fare indication, the fare-indicating mechanism shall be actuated by the distance mechanism whenever the vehicle is in motion at such a speed that the rate of distance revenue equals or exceeds the time rate and may be actuated by the time mechanism whenever the vehicle speed is less than this and when the vehicle is not in motion. Means shall be provided for the vehicle operator to render the time mechanism either operative or inoperative with respect to the fare-indicating mechanism.
2.
Operating condition.
i.
Generally. Whenever the indicating elements of a taximeter are set to indicate a charge for the hire of the vehicle, the character of the fare indication shall be clearly shown on the taximeter face. When a taximeter is cleared, the indication "not registering," "vacant" or an equivalent expression shall be shown.
ii.
Single-tariff taximeter. Whenever a single-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the indication "registering," "hired" or an equivalent expression shall be shown.
iii.
Multiple-tariff taximeter. Whenever a multiple-tariff taximeter is set so as to register charges, the basis for the particular tariff for which it is set shall be shown.
3.
Extra charges. Extra charges shall be indicated as a separate item and shall not be included in the fare indication. They shall be identified by the term "extras" or by an equivalent expression. Values shall be defined by suitable words or monetary signs.

Protection of indications. Indications of fare and extras shall be displayed through and entirely protected by glass or other suitable transparent material securely attached to the housing of the taximeter.
5.
Basis of fare calculations. A taximeter shall calculate fares only upon the basis of distance traveled, time elapsed or a combination of distance traveled and time elapsed.
6.
Design of operating control.
i.
Means of control. A control lever-arm knob, handle or other convenient and effective means shall be provided to set the taximeter mechanism for the desired operating condition and to clear the taximeter.
ii.
Positions of control. The several positions of the control lever shall be mechanically defined, and displacement from any of these positions shall be sufficiently obstructed that the accidental or inadvertent changing of the operating condition of the taximeter is improbable. Possible movement of this control to an operating position immediately following its movement to the cleared position shall automatically be delayed enough to permit the taximeter mechanism to come to complete rest in the cleared condition.
7.
Provision for security seals. Adequate provision shall be made for affixing lead-and-wire seals to a taximeter and to other parts required for service operation of a complete installation on a vehicle so that no adjustments, alterations or replacements affecting in any way the accuracy or indications of the device or the assembly can be made without mutilating the seals. The sealing means shall be such that it is not necessary to disassemble or remove any part of the device or of the vehicle to apply or inspect the seals.
8.
Distance test methods. To determine compliance with distance tolerances, a distance test of a taximeter shall be conducted utilizing one or more of the following test methods:
i.
Road test. A road test consists of driving the vehicle over a precisely measured road course.

Sec. 162-61. - Number limited; costs.
(a)
The maximum number of taxicab CPNC's outstanding shall be 1,600, which is the number of CPNC's issued as a result of the legislative limitation established in 1995. This limitation is specifically based upon the relationship between the number of taxicabs operating within a geographic area and the quality of service they provide. An excessive number of taxicabs results in a reduced level of service and more passenger complaints. A taxicab CPNC will be issued to, and can only remain affixed to a vehicle which meets the age limitations set forth below:
No vehicle having a vehicle age greater than ten years may be operated as a taxicab in the city. For purposes of this article, the term "vehicle age" shall be determined based on the vehicle's model year, and a "year" shall be measured through the last day of that respective calendar year (for example, a vehicle with a model year of 2000 shall have a vehicle age of one year as of January 1, 2001). This ten-year age provision shall be temporary in nature and shall only remain in effect until December 31, 2015, after which time, it shall no longer be of any further force and effect, and said taxicab age provision shall revert back to a "vehicle age" of no greater than eight years.
As of August 15, 2001, no new or replacement taxicab vehicle may be operated as a taxicab in the city if such vehicle is greater than five years old. However, until December 31, 2015, any such new or replacement vehicle for which a CPNC is obtained may continue to be operated as a taxicab through that vehicle's tenth model year provided that the vehicle continues to be in compliance with all other provisions of the City Code which pertain to the regulation of taxicabs licensed to operate in the city.
After December 31, 2015, any such new or replacement vehicle may continue to be operated as a taxicab through that vehicle's eighth model year provided that the vehicle continues to be in compliance with all other provisions of the City Code which pertain to the regulation of taxicabs licensed to operate in the city.
(b)
The maximum number of animal-drawn vehicle CPNC's outstanding shall be 31, which is the number of CPNC's issued as a result of the legislative limitation established in 1995. This limitation is specifically based upon the quality of service provided by animal-drawn vehicles and upon the necessity for humane treatment of the animals involved.
(c)
Reserved.
(d)
The market value- of any type of CPNC will be determined on January 1 of each year. Any CPNC sold by the City of Atlanta will be sold in accordance with Chapter 2, Article X of the Atlanta Code of Ordinances; and shall be sold for no less than market value during that year.

Sec. 162-61.1. - Renewal.
The CPNC holder shall apply for and obtain an annual renewal of the CPNC upon payment of a fee of $100.00 and provision of evidence that the holder continues to possess the necessary qualifications for holding a CPNC. This fee shall be paid by the last day of the month in which the CPNC was initially issued.

(7)
The transferee shall supply proof to the department that he or his transferor has filed a bond to cover all of the outstanding tort liabilities of the transferor in excess of the amount covered by a bond or insurance policy in effect at the time the claim arose; however, this requirement shall not apply to a legatee or distributee of a descendant's estate owning a CPNC.

The CPNC shall be automatically suspended upon the death of the CPNC holder pending the presentation of letters of temporary administration to the department. If no application for a transfer has been filed within one year from the time of the presentation of letters of temporary administration to the department, this shall constitute due cause for the revocation of the CPNC.

A certified copy of the relevant death certificate;
