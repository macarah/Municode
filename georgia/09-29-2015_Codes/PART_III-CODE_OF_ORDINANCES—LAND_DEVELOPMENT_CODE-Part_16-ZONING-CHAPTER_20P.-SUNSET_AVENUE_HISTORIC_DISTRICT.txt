(Ord. No. 2011-19(11-O-0447), § 1, 5-25-11)
Sec. 16-20P.004. - Organization.
The overlay zoning regulations for the Sunset Avenue Historic District are composed of two parts. The first part consists of general regulations which apply to all property located within this district. The second part consists of specific regulations.
(Ord. No. 2011-19(11-O-0447), § 1, 5-25-11)
Sec. 16-20P.005. - General regulations.
The following regulations shall apply to all properties within the Sunset Avenue Historic District.
1.
General criteria:
a.
The commission shall apply the standards referenced below if the standards set forth elsewhere in this Chapter 20P do not specifically address the application, including but not limited to commercial properties in the district:
(1)
A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features and exterior spatial relationships.
(2)
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, and exterior spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided.
(3)
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties or eras.
(4)
Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
(5)
Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials.
(6)
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old, but shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, massing, scale and proportion, to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
(7)
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
2.
The compatibility rule:
a.
In general, the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, massing, and general character of (i) the structure itself, (ii) the contributing buildings in the entire block, and (iii) the contributing buildings in the subarea.
b.
The compatibility rule is a method of requiring that alterations and new construction are sensitive and sympathetic to existing elements of the immediate environment constituting a particular block. In accordance with this purpose, the compatibility rule is as follows: "The elements in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same block face, or where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same block face."
c.
To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule. Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in regulations by reference to the "compatibility rule."
3.
Certificates of appropriateness:
a.
When required:
(1)
To change the exterior appearance of any portion of a structure within the district, when said change can be seen from the public right-of-way;
(2)
To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any structure within the district, when said addition can be seen from public right-of-way;
(3)
To demolish or move any contributing principal structure, in whole or in part, within the district; and
(4)
Site work.
b.
Type required:
(1)
Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Code of Ordinances.
(2)
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit.
(3)
Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance are not required in this district. This exemption in no way obviates the requirements for certificates of appropriateness set forth in this section.
(4)
The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the director of the commission and shall be required for any of the following:
(a)
Fences, walls, and retaining walls;
(b)
Decks, skylights, solar panels, and mechanical and communication equipment if visible from the public right-of-way;
(c)
New accessory structures and alterations to existing accessory structures;
(d)
Shutters and awnings if visible from the public right-of-way;
(e)
Replacement of non-original, non-historic or missing elements with elements that otherwise meet the regulations, including but not limited to: siding, windows, porch railings, porch columns, porch flooring, exterior doors, if visible from the public right-of-way, and
(f)
Paving.
If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director of the commission shall issue the Type II certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of section 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates.
(5)
The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for any of the following to the extent they are visible from the public right-of-way:
(a)
Alterations to any façade of any principal structure; and
(b)
All site work, except as noted in section 16-20P.005(3)(b)(4).
(6)
The following Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for:
(a)
All new principal structures;
(b)
Additions visible from the public right-of-way;
(c)
Revisions to previously approved plans that result in an increase in floor area ratio, lot coverage, height or a change in the building footprint;
(d)
Subdivisions and aggregations; and
(e)
Variances.
(7)
Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and required for demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance of the front façade.
4.
Variances and special exceptions: The urban design commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in Chapter 26 of this part 16. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for special exceptions pursuant to the standards in Chapter 25 of this part.
5.
Subdivision and aggregation of lots: The subdivision of any lot within this district shall be subject to review and approval by the commission. No subdivision of lots shall be approved by the director of the office of planning unless said matter has first been submitted to and approved by the commission. No lots shall be aggregated except upon approval of the commission. Applications shall be made to the commission, and the commission shall not approve any subdivision or aggregation of lots unless the commission shall make a finding that the resulting lot or lots are compatible with the historic platting pattern of Sunset Avenue as it existed in 1968 and meet the compatibility rule with regard to lot size, dimensions and configuration.
6.
Financial hardship exemptions:
a.
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility within the district. However, in order to balance this concern with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner.
b.
In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purpose.
c.
If the urban design commission finds that this requirement of subsection (b) herein is satisfied, they shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
(1)
The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
(2)
The availability, at present or in the future of other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
(3)
The cost associated with adherence to the subarea regulations;
(4)
The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure;
(5)
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
d.
The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations.
