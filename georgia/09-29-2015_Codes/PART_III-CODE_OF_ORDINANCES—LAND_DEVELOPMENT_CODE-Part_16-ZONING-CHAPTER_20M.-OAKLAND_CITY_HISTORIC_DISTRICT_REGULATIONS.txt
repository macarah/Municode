Sec. 16-20M.005. - Compatibility rule.
The intent of the mayor and council in establishing the regulations of the Oakland City Historic District is to ensure that all work requiring a certificate of appropriateness is compatible with the historic design, scale, and general character of the entire district and of the contributing structures in the immediately adjacent environment of a particular block face. To further that intent and simultaneously permit flexibility in design, the regulations provide a compatibility rule which is as follows: Where quantifiable (i.e. building height, setback, etc.), the element or building characteristic in question shall be no less than the smallest such element or building characteristic of buildings or site layouts in that block face that characterizes such like contributing buildings and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure and shall be no greater than the greatest such element or building characteristic of buildings or site layouts in that block face that characterizes such like contributing buildings or site layouts and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure. Where not quantifiable (roof form, architectural trim, etc.), the element or building characteristic in question shall be compatible with that which predominates in such like contributing structures on that block face and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure.
(Ord. No. 2003-102, § 3(Att. C), 11-10-03)
Sec. 16-20M.006. - General criteria.

Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Zoning Code.
(3)
The commission shall apply the standards referenced in 16.20.009 only if the standards set forth in this Chapter 20M do not specifically address the application.

(2)
Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be required for: minor alterations to any principal structure when the alterations are visible from a public street; and the construction of fences, walls, accessory structures, decks, and paving. If the proposed alteration meets the requirements of section 16-20M.007, then the director of the commission shall issue the Type II certificate of appropriateness within 14 days of application for such certificate. If the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of section 16-20M.012 and .013, the director of the commission shall deny the application.

Sec. 16-20M.008. - Variances.

(Ord. No. 2003-102, § 3(Att. C), 11-10-03)
Sec. 16-20M.009. - Financial hardship exemptions.
(1)
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations to a property owner's principle residence on the grounds of economic hardship to the property owner.
(2)
The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant.
(3)
The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:

Sec. 16-20M.013. - Architectural standards.
(1)
Statement of intent. The purpose of these regulations is to set forth basic, minimum standards of architectural design and construction that are compatible with and complementary to the existing historic residences within the neighborhood, as the cumulative historic diversity of the built environment is a defining characteristic of this neighborhood. It is not the intent of these regulations to limit the design of new housing to replication of styles of existing structures, but to foster residential design that, with regard to massing, size, scale, materials, and architectural elements, enhances the architectural quality of the neighborhood and simultaneously encourages creativity. Additionally, these regulations are intended to integrate the physical characteristics of new construction into the existing neighborhood in a meaningful way so as to restore and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of this neighborhood.
The following residential architectural styles currently predominate in the neighborhood and contribute to its unique historic character; they are included here for reference only:
American Four Square, Craftsman, English Vernacular Revival, Folk Victorian, Queen Anne, and Minimal Traditional Cottages.
