Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by the city as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the proposed change, transfer, or acquisition of ownership or control. The city may impose conditions on its consent regarding the technical, operating, customer service, and financial aspects of the cable system as well as the transferee's acceptance of conditions related to past non-compliance with this chapter or the franchise.

In the event of such removal, the grantee shall promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has been removed to a condition satisfactory to the city.
Any property of grantee's to be abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such manner as the city may prescribe. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of a grantee in place, each grantee shall submit to the city an instrument to be approved by the city, transferring to the city the ownership of such property.
(Ord. No. 2009-51.1(94-O-1777), § 15.0, 11-28-94)
Sec. 34-16. - Purchase by city.
Upon the termination, revocation pursuant to section 34-15, expiration of franchise term without request for renewal, cancellation pursuant to sections 134-5(c), 34-15(e) or 34-15(f), or the non-renewal of any grantee's franchise, the city shall have the right to purchase the cable system as provided herein subject to the provisions of the cable act, and the city may direct such grantee to cease operation of the cable system.
If, upon termination, revocation pursuant to section 34-15, expiration of franchise term without request for renewal, cancellation pursuant to sections 34-15(c), 34-15(e), or 34-15(f), or the non-renewal of a franchise, the city exercises its option to purchase the cable system, the value calculated below upon the date of such termination, cancellation, non-renewal or revocation, shall constitute the agreed purchase price subject to the provisions of the cable act.
The purchase price to the city for the cable system shall be the fair market value of the cable system as of the date of such termination, cancellation or non-renewal. Such fair market value shall be determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. Such fair market value, if not agreed upon by the city and the grantee, shall be determined by mediation, or if still unresolved, the parties may seek resolution in the courts. The purchase price to the city for the cable system in the event of revocation shall be at an equitable price.
Prior to the transfer or assignment of the beneficial ownership of any franchise, pursuant to section 34-14, the city shall have the right to purchase such cable system assets at the price and on the terms comparable to those offered by the proposed transferee or assignee, within 60 days of grantee's notice to the city of such proposed transfer or assignment, provided, however that the city shall not have such right of purchase in the event of transfer to an affiliated entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such grantee or its parent company.
If the city elects to purchase the cable system, such grantee shall be required, upon payment of the purchase price, promptly to execute all appropriate documents to transfer title to the city, and shall assign all of the contracts, leases, licenses, permits, and any other rights necessary, in the discretion of the city, to maintain continuity of service to the public. The grantee shall be required to cooperate with the city or with any other person, partnership, corporation or legal entity authorized or directed by the city to operate the cable system for a temporary period, in maintaining continuity of service.
(Ord. No. 2009-51.1(94-O-1777), § 17.0, 11-28-94)
Sec. 34-17. - Regulatory authority.
(a)
Change in law or regulation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the local, state and federal government, including, without limitation, those applicable to the construction and operation of the cable communications system. Nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver of grantee's right to challenge the validity of any such law, rule or regulation. In the event that any actions of the state or federal government or any agency thereof, or any court of competent jurisdiction upon final adjudication, substantially reduce in any way the power or authority of the city under this chapter or the franchise, or if in compliance with any local, state, or federal law or regulation, the grantee finds conflict with the terms of this chapter, the franchise, or any law or regulation of the city, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify the city of the point of conflict believed to exist between such law or regulation and the laws or regulations of the city, this chapter and the franchise. The city, at its option, may notify the grantee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions which are affected in any way by such modification in regulations or statutory authority. Thereafter, the grantee shall negotiate in good faith with the City to develop alternate provisions which shall fairly restore the city to the maximum level of authority and power permitted by law.
(b)
Authority. The city reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary authority, as may at any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable communications system, the franchise and the grantee. Should applicable legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities at any time permit regulation not presently permitted to the city, the city may without the approval of the grantee engage in any such additional regulation as may then be permissible, whether or not contemplated by this chapter; provided, however, that any amendment to this chapter shall be confined to the lawful exercise of the city's police powers and to changes which do not materially alter the rights of the franchisee under the franchise.
(c)
Right of inspection of records. To the extent consistent with laws governing subscriber privacy and any other applicable laws, the city shall have the right to inspect all books, records, reports, maps, income tax returns (at the time of transfer, renewal or rate proceedings where necessary), financial statements, service complaint summary reports, performance test results and other like materials of the grantee which relate to the operation of the franchise, upon reasonable prior notice, at any time during normal business hours.
(d)
Right of inspection of cable system facilities. The grantee shall grant the city the right to inspect all cable system facilities or installation work performed subject to the provisions of this chapter, the franchise and applicable laws and regulations, and shall have the right to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of this chapter, the franchise, and other applicable laws and regulations.
(e)
