CHAPTER 19E. - PD-CS PLANNED DEVELOPMENT—CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-19E.001. - Scope of provisions and purpose.
The following regulations and requirements apply to PD-CS Planned Development—Conservation Subdivision Districts, defined for purposes of these regulations as planned development districts primarily for the following purposes:
(1)
To provide a residential zoning district that is density neutral and permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land and to provide for the preservation of greenspace in perpetuity;
(2)
To enhance land, water, air, and tree resources by minimizing the area of land disturbance; reducing impervious surfaces, reducing soil erosion and stormwater runoff, optimizing stream buffers, preserving tree cover, and encouraging retention and protection of greenspace;
(3)
To preserve in perpetuity archaeological or historic sites, scenic views, and sensitive natural resources such as floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, and wildlife habitat;
(4)
To maintain the total number of dwellings in a density-neutral manner, and to provide a process that allows all interested parties an opportunity to verify that the proposal is in compliance with this ordinance and related regulations;
(5)
To encourage development on the least environmentally sensitive soils, and to reduce the amount of public infrastructure and associated costs borne by the city;
(6)
To encourage interaction in the community and reduce impervious surfaces by clustering dwellings and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places, and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood;
(7)
To promote interconnected greenways which provide pedestrian linkages, recreational opportunities, and wildlife corridors throughout the city and adjacent jurisdictions; and
(8)
To encourage designs that reduce traffic, speed, and reliance on automobiles, and to encourage walking, biking, and public transportation connectivity to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities.

Sec. 16-19E.006. - Site planning.
Site planning within the districts shall provide protection of the development from potentially adverse surrounding influences, and protection of surrounding areas from potentially adverse influences from within the development.
(1)
Principal vehicular access points: Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turnout lanes and/or traffic dividers and extra width of the approach street shall be required where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need. In general, minor streets shall not be connected with streets outside PD-CS districts in such a way as to encourage use of such minor streets by substantial amounts of through traffic.
(2)
Access for pedestrians and cyclists: Access for pedestrians and cyclists entering or leaving the PD-CS district shall be by safe and convenient routes. Such access need not be adjacent to, or limited to the vicinity of vehicular access points. Where there are crossings of pedestrian ways and vehicular routes at edges of planned developments, such crossings shall be safely marked and controlled; and where such ways are exposed to substantial vehicular traffic at edges of districts, safeguards may be required to prevent crossing except at designated points.
(3)
Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians: Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians shall be as generally provided at section 16-28.008(9) of the City of Atlanta Zoning Ordinance, "Visibility Clearance at Intersections." In addition, where there is pedestrian or bicycle access from within the development to a street at its edges by paths or across yards or other open space without a barrier to access to the street, no material impediment to visibility, as defined therein, shall be created or maintained within areas appropriate to the circumstances of the case, but in any event within a visibility triangle equivalent to that required at section 16-28.008(9).
(4)
Fences, walls or vegetative screening at edges of PD-CS districts: Fences, walls or vegetative screening at edges of PD-CS districts may be provided where needed to protect residents from undesirable views, lighting, noise or other off-site influences, or to protect occupants of adjoining residential districts from similar adverse influences within the PD-CS district. In particular, extensive off-street parking areas and areas for storage and collection of refuse and garbage shall be screened.
(5)
Streets, drives, and parking: Streets, drives, and parking shall provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units for service and emergency vehicles. Streets shall not be so laid out as to occupy more land than is required to provide access as indicated, nor create unnecessary fragmentation of the development into small blocks. Interior streets, whether intended for private ownership and maintenance or public dedication and use, shall be configured and constructed as required by the City of Atlanta Fire Marshal or Department of Public Works. No interior streets shall be dedicated to the city, unless the streets meet all standards and approvals as required by the Department of Public Works.
(6)
Internal relationships, site planning: The site plan shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures and for preservation of desirable natural features and minimum disturbance of natural topography.
(7)
Vehicular access to other streets or portions of streets: Vehicular access to other streets or portions of streets from off-street parking shall be so combined, limited, located, designed and controlled as to channel traffic from and to such areas conveniently, safely and in a manner which minimizes marginal traffic friction and promotes free flow of traffic on streets without excessive interruption.
(8)
Ways for pedestrian and cyclists: Walkways shall be provided and shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling units, project facilities, and principal off-site pedestrian destinations. Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children and routes to school or other destinations shall be so located and safeguarded as to minimize contact with normal automotive traffic. If substantial bicycle traffic is anticipated, bicycle paths shall be coordinated with the walkway system. Street crossings shall be held to a minimum on such walkways, shall be located and designed to promote safety, and shall be appropriately marked and otherwise safeguarded.
(9)
Water, Sanitary Sewer and Storm Water Utilities. All water, sanitary sewer and storm water utilities, whether intended for private ownership and maintenance or public dedication and use, shall be configured and constructed as required by the Department of Watershed Management. No water sanitary sewer or storm water utilities shall be dedicated to the city, unless such utilities meet all standards and approvals required by the Department of Watershed Management.
(10)
Infrastructure. Prior to the issuance of any building permit, all infrastructure, private or public, shown on approved site plans shall be installed.
