A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (a) of this section unless the person or person's agent files an affidavit with the tax commissioner of Fulton County giving the person's age, or if disabled, the certificate or certificates required by subsection (b) of this section, and the amount of income which the person and the person's spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes, and such additional information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to such exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose.
(d)
Applications for the homestead exemption provided for by this section shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for homestead exemptions, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead exemptions, as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto. After a person has filed the proper affidavit and certificate or certificates, it shall not be necessary to make application and file the said affidavit and certificate thereafter for any year and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of any such person, however, to notify the tax commissioner in the event such person becomes ineligible for any reason to receive the homestead exemption granted by this section.
(e)
The homestead exemption granted by this section shall be cumulative of any other homestead exemption applicable to City of Atlanta or City of Atlanta School District ad valorem taxes. The homestead exemption granted by this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1990.

Sec. 9-61. - Short title.

Sec. 9-62. - Findings and purpose.
Economically distressed areas exist within the City of Atlanta and show higher unemployment, poverty, and less investment than other areas of the city. It is further found that these areas are commonly characterized by no investment or under investment by private enterprise in ventures which produce housing units, jobs, trade, provision of services, and other economic activities that individually and together contribute to a healthy society. This lack of private investment, economic activity, and housing activity contributes materially to economic distress in such areas. Additionally, the city recognizes the importance of workplace housing in all areas of the city. Therefore, it is in the public interest that incentives be provided to private enterprise to invest in such areas by developing housing units, creating jobs and trade, providing services, and by other economic activities. It is the purpose of this Act, therefore, to grant special powers of tax abatement to the city to provide such incentives. It is the intention of the General Assembly of Georgia that this act be liberally construed to carry out such purpose.

(a)
In order to be designated as an enterprise zone, a nominated area shall meet at least three of the five criteria specified in subsections (b) through (f), or the criteria specified in subsection (g), of this section.
In determining whether an area suffers from poverty, unemployment, or general distress, the governing body shall use data from the most current United States decennial census and from other information published by the United States Bureau of the census, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Georgia Department of Labor. In determining whether an area suffers from underdevelopment, the governing body shall use the data specified in subsection (e) of this section. The data shall be comparable in point or period of time and methodology employed. In addition to census geographies, the analysis may use the city's neighborhood statistical areas. In addition to the following basic criteria, additional variables and methodologies may be used.
(b)
Pervasive poverty shall be evidenced by showing that poverty is widespread throughout the nominated area and shall be established by using the following criteria:
(1)
The poverty rate shall be determined from the data in the most current United States decennial census prepared by the United States Bureau of the Census;
(2)
For parcels within the nominated area, the parcels must be within or adjacent to a census block group where the ratio of income to poverty level for at least 15 percent of the residents shall be less than 1.0;
(3)
Census geographic block groups with no population shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the standards of paragraph (2) of this subsection; and
(4)
All parcels of a nominated area must abut and may not contain a noncontiguous parcel, unless such nonabutting parcel qualifies separately under the criteria set forth under paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(c)
Unemployment shall be evidenced by the use of data published by the Office of Labor Information Systems of the Georgia Department of labor indicating that the average rate of the unemployment for the nominated area for the preceding calendar year is at least 10 percent higher than the state average rate of unemployment or by evidence of adverse economic conditions brought about by significant job dislocation within the nominated area such as the closing of a manufacturing plant or federal facility.
(d)
General distress shall be evidenced by adverse conditions within the nominated area other than those of pervasive poverty and unemployment. Examples of such adverse conditions include, but are not limited to, a high incidence of crime, abandoned or dilapidated structures, deteriorated infrastructure, and substantial population decline.
(e)
Underdevelopment shall be evidenced by data indicating development activities, or lack thereof, through land disturbance permits, business license fees, building permits, development fees, or other similar data indicating that the level of development in the nominated area is lower than development activity within the local governing body's jurisdiction.
(f)
General blight within the nominated area shall be evidenced by the inclusion of any portion of the nominated area in an urban redevelopment area as defined by this state.
(g)
The city shall provide special urban enterprise zone designations for the creation and preservation of workforce housing units especially in areas with strong real estate markets. To mitigate against the concentration of poverty, lack of access to opportunity, long commutes, and excessive cost burdens, the city shall provide for special designation of workforce housing enterprise zones anywhere in the city. The city shall utilize evidence-based and state of the practice methods to determine the optimum location for workforce housing enterprise zones. The Atlanta Urban Enterprise Zone Act was established before July 1, 1997, and pursuant to Chapter 88 of the Title 36 of the O.C.G.A. preserves its authority to create, maintain, and regulate enterprise zones.
