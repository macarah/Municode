If the transcription is so made pursuant to a request by either party in the hearing, the cost thereof shall be borne by the party making the request.

(8)
Dismissal for want of commencement. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection (1) of this section, where the hearing is not held within 18 months after receipt of the notice of appeal by the commissioner of human resources, the adverse action which is the subject of the appeal shall be dismissed without prejudice, and the appellant shall thereafter be entitled to relief set forth in section 114-553(c), except that any period of postponement or continuance of the hearing for the convenience of the appellant shall be excluded from the calculation of this 18 month period.

The city is proud of its tradition of a collegial work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.

It is illegal and against the policies of the city for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another employee.

Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to: unwanted sexual advances; demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment or continued employment; repeated sexual jokes, flirtations, advances or propositions; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; graphic, verbal commentary about an individual's body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling, touching, pinching, assault, coerced sexual acts or suggestive, insulting, obscene comments or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; ostracizing an employee in conformity with sexual conduct; sexual conduct that reasonably causes mental and emotional detriment to the victim; retaliation against an individual for reporting or complaining about sexually harassing conduct. This behavior is unacceptable in the workplace and is unacceptable in other work-related settings such as business trips and business-related social events.

Sec. 114-604. - Complaint and investigation procedure.
Employees who feel that they have been victims of sexual harassment should file a discrimination complaint. Prompt reporting of complaints is strongly encouraged, as it allows for rapid response and resolution of objectionable behavior or conditions for the complainant and any other affected employees. An individual who believes he or she has been subjected to sexual harassment should report the incident to any of the following: employee's departmental EEO coordinator or complaint investigator, the city's diversity manager, or the employee's supervisor or commissioner. In the case of employees in the departments of police, fire or corrections, complaints of sexual harassment may also be made at their respective office of professional standards. The aggrieved employee may elect, at his or her option, to use formal or informal procedures as follows:
(1)
Informal complaint procedure:
a.
Each department shall designate the departmental EEO coordinator (DEEOC) and at least one man and one woman from the department to serve as complaint investigators.
b.
The complainant will meet with a complaint investigator of his/her choosing to discuss any complaint of sexual harassment. A written statement will be taken. An accurate record of objectionable behavior is necessary to resolve a complaint of sexual harassment.
c.
The complaint investigator will immediately attempt to resolve the complaint through discussions with appropriate managers, scheduling of meetings with concerned parties, and other informal efforts as appropriate, taking care to preserve confidentiality to the maximum reasonable extent.
d.
Upon completion of the investigation, the complaint investigator will forward a written report of the investigation to the department head, with recommendations for resolution or corrective action as appropriate.
e.
If the investigative report indicates that there is "reasonable cause" to believe that sexually harassing conduct has occurred, the department head shall implement disciplinary procedures, as outlined below in section 114-605(b), as may be appropriate.
f.
If the informal efforts are unsuccessful, the complaint investigator will inform the complainant of his/her right to file a formal complaint with the affirmative action division, and will provide the complainant with a copy of the formal charge form.
(2)
Formal complaint procedure: If the complainant elects not to pursue the informal procedures or is not satisfied with the results of the informal procedures, a formal complaint may be filed with the diversity manager in the department of human resources as follows:
a.
The complaint will be reduced to a written statement on an appropriate form. An accurate record of objectionable behavior is necessary to resolve a complaint of sexual harassment.
b.
The diversity manager will review the complaint to assure that the issue is appropriate for the discrimination complaint process. If it is incomplete, the diversity manager will seek clarification.
c.
The diversity manager will notify the appropriate departmental officials of the complaint.
d.
An investigation of the formal complaint will be initiated by the affirmative action division within five working days of the notification.
e.
Upon completion of the investigation, the diversity manager will forward a report of the investigation, with recommendations for appropriate resolution or corrective action, to the commissioner of the department of human resources for review and any recommended changes.
f.
The commissioner of the department of personnel and human resources shall forward the report to the head of the office or department in which the harassment is alleged to have taken place.
g.
If the investigative report indicates that there is "reasonable cause" to believe that sexually harassing conduct has occurred, the department head shall initiate disciplinary procedures, as outlined below in section 114-605 as may be appropriate.
h.
The finding of "reasonable cause" by the diversity manager as approved by the commissioner of the department of human resources on a formal complaint will result in the issuance of a notice of proposed adverse action, where appropriate.
(3)
A member of the public who believes that he or she has been subjected to sexual harassment by a city employee should report the incident to the employee's department head or to the diversity manager, for investigation by the diversity manager in the manner outlined in subparagraph (2) above. Alternatively, members of the public may make sexual harassment complaints against employees of the departments of police, fire and corrections at the office of professional standards of the appropriate department.

Sec. 114-605. - Resolving the complaint.
(a)
Determination of "no cause": If the investigation reveals that there is no "reasonable cause" to believe that the allegation of sexual harassment is true, the matter shall be deemed resolved for city purposes and the parties shall be free to pursue other available legal remedies.
(b)
Determination of "cause":
(1)
Discipline of "cause": If the investigation reveals that there is "reasonable cause" to believe that the allegation of sexual harassment is true, the employee determined to have committed the offense of sexual harassment shall be subject to disciplinary action.

(2)
Penalty: Sexual harassment is considered a sufficient ground for serious adverse personnel action. Failure to comply with any part of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. A severe or pervasive violation of this policy may result in an employee's termination for the first offense. Where appropriate, specific disciplinary action will follow the process prescribed by section 114-526 through 114-556 of this Code of Ordinances. The employee's appointing authority shall impose discipline within the following ranges:

As the staffing needs of the city dictate, and whenever possible and practical, a victim's request for a transfer to an assignment or location away from that of the harasser shall be granted for a period of at least one year from the date of the last act of sexual harassment. This provision shall not be mandatory where impractical, inefficient, logistically impossible or contrary to the best interests of the city as a whole, or a department, office or agency.
