The maximum number of animal-drawn vehicle CPNC's outstanding shall be 31, which is the number of CPNC's issued as a result of the legislative limitation established in 1995. This limitation is specifically based upon the quality of service provided by animal-drawn vehicles and upon the necessity for humane treatment of the animals involved.
