CHAPTER 43. - CAMPBELLTON ROAD OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 16-43.001. - Scope of regulations.
These regulations constitute the Campbellton Road Overlay District. The scope of these regulations are as follows:
1.
The existing zoning map and underlying zoning regulations governing all properties within the Campbellton Road Overlay District shall remain in full force and effect. The regulations contained within this chapter shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, these existing zoning regulations. Whenever the following overlay regulations vary from the existing underlying zoning regulations, the regulations of this chapter 43 shall apply.
( Ord. No. 2022-21(22-O-1019) , § 1(Exh. A), 7-14-22)
Sec. 16-43.002. - Findings and statement of intent.
The city finds that Campbellton Road is a corridor of residential, commercial, and mixed-use land uses that serves as the main street of southwest Atlanta. Campbellton Road has been identified as an economic development priority area and is in the Campbellton Road Tax Allocation District (TAD). Historically the corridor has served the established neighborhoods of Adams Park, Arlington Estates, Ashley Courts, Baker Hills, Ben Hill, Ben Hill Acres, Ben Hill Forest, Ben Hill Pines, Ben Hill Terrace, Bonnybrook, Brentwood, Briar Glen, Butner/Tell, Campbellton Road, Cascade Green, Continental Colony, Deerwood, Elmco Estates, Fairburn, Fairburn Tell, Fairway Acres, Fort Valley, Greenbriar, Greenbriar Village, Heritage Valley, Huntington, Kings Forest, Lake Estates, Laurens Valley, Meadows, Meadowbrook Forest, Mellwood, Mt. Gilead Woods, Niskey Cove, Niskey Lake, Old Fairburn Village, Pamona Park, Princeton Lakes, Rue Royal, Sandlewood Estates, Southwest Canopy Overlook, Tampa Park, Venetian Hills, Wildwood Forest, and Windsor Forest and now serves newer neighbors in the City of South Fulton and the City of East Point. To ensure that the growth envisioned in Atlanta City Design is in keeping with the needs and desires of residents there is a need for special consideration to ensure that future development and redevelopment within this area reflect a mixture of uses that promote the public health, safety, and welfare. In establishing this Overlay District, the city intends to anticipate, and restrict or encourage as may be appropriate, certain uses as well as the size and scale of those uses, in a manner that:
1.
Is consistent with the comprehensive development plan; and
2.
Properly balances increasing residential and retail uses with the district's ongoing commercial and mixed-use development; and
3.
Provides greater regulation of businesses within the district that attract large numbers of people working and living on and along the corridor.
