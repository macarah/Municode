ARTICLE IX. - LOADING AND UNLOADING OF INTERCITY BUSES

Sec. 150-300. - Purpose.
(a)
The City Council of the City of Atlanta, Georgia hereby declares its legislative intent to regulate the loading or unloading passengers by intercity buses on City right-of-way to the extent that such activity is not already regulated by prior agreements or other laws. The City Council finds that the intercity buses which load and unload passengers on the City right-of-way often impede street traffic, block sidewalks or crosswalks and make it more difficult to access businesses and their loading zones.
(b)
The City Council finds that the regulation of the loading or unloading of passengers by intercity buses on City right-of-way will improve the flow of traffic, increase pedestrian safety, aid the efficient operation of businesses as well as maximize connectivity of transportation resources if the place of such operations is controlled or occurs at a centralized location.
(c)
The City Council finds that the goal of having bus services connect to mass transit terminals, whether serving a single mode or as the hub for existing and proposed transportation networks serving metropolitan Atlanta and beyond, including MARTA rail and bus systems, regional express bus systems, and the Georgia railroad network, requires that use of such terminals should be made mandatory for certain types of bus operations that will lessen the congestion cause by providing such services on or adjacent to the public right-of-way by providing a viable transportation alternative for commuters.
(d)
The City Council finds that the regulation of the loading or unloading of passengers by intercity buses on City right-of-way can be controlled by the issuance of permits in order to more effectively carry out this article and give notice to the public of the locations where such activities will take place.

Sec. 150-301. - Prior agreements with MARTA not superseded.
No provision of the rapid transit contract assistance agreement by and between the City of Atlanta and the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority ("MARTA") and other parties as it exists now or as it is from time to time amended shall be superseded by this article. To the extent that any term of this article is in conflict with the rapid transit contract assistance agreement, it is the intent of the City of Atlanta that the interpretation which preserves the term of such agreement shall be preferred.
