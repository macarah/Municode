(Code 1977, § 8-2095; Ord. No. 1998-27, §§ 7—10, 5-12-98; Ord. No. 2000-30, § 1, 5-23-00; Ord. No. 2000-54, § 1, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 2001-69, § 1, 9-26-01; Ord. No. 2002-64, § 1, 8-26-02; Ord. No. 2004-49, §§ 1—3, 8-20-04; Ord. No. 2017-63(17-O-1275), § 7, 11-6-17 )
Sec. 8-2096. - Duties and responsibilities.
(a)
The owner of a structure shall be responsible for maintaining the minimum standards required by this article unless his lease with the operator provides otherwise. In any event, the operator shall be responsible:
(1)
For keeping all parts of the premises under the control of the operator in a clean and safe condition and the operator shall refrain from performing any acts which would render other parts of the premises unclean, insanitary, or unsafe or which would obstruct the owner from performing any duty required by this article;
(2)
For the elimination of infestation in or on the premises subject to his control;
(3)
For maintaining all plumbing fixtures used by the operator in a clean, sanitary, and operable condition and he shall not deposit any material in any fixture or sewer system which would result in stoppage of or damage to the fixture or sewer system; and
(4)
For not permitting ceiling or wall fixtures to be used for supplying power to equipment other than that for which they are designed or allowing the use of loose cords or extension lines in excess of six (6) feet.
(b)

(Code 1977, § 8-2096)
Sec. 8-2097. - Legal effect.
It is not the purpose or intention of this article that any law be held to be in conflict with it and hereby repealed; rather, it is the intention of this article to be given the legal effect set forth in section 8-2082.
(Code 1977, § 8-2097)
Sec. 8-2098. - Vacant buildings; nuisances.
(a)
It is hereby found that there are buildings and other structures and parts of compartmentalized buildings and structures in the city of all zoning classifications which are vacant. By reason of their continued vacancy, these buildings and other structures are subjected to vandalism primarily brought about by reason of removing various parts of the structure. Removal of parts of the structure creates a condition whereby such buildings and other structures are subject to an unauthorized entry. It is further found that when such buildings and other structures are subject to an unauthorized entry, they become a breeding ground for victimless criminal activity, such as, but not limited to, intemperate use of alcoholic beverages and use of drugs, thus leading to incidences of destruction of such buildings and other structures by fire and also creating health and sanitation hazards. Additionally, it is found that other criminal activity, such as, but not limited to, murder and rape, are likewise carried on in such buildings and other structures. Such an unauthorized entry allows various classes of criminal conduct to be carried on in such clandestine surroundings. It is further found that such activity occurs in buildings and structures that may not, within the meaning of applicable portions of Georgia laws and of the Atlanta Housing Code, be subject to demolition and other proceedings.
(b)
Therefore, and in furtherance of the legislative findings hereinabove set forth, it is hereby declared by the council that such buildings and other structures, upon a proper adjudication of such as a nuisance as hereinafter provided, are a nuisance and, under the police power of the city, subject to appropriate abatement proceedings. Further, it is hereby declared by the council that such buildings and other structures are nuisances not only with respect to the safety of the inhabitants of the city, but also with respect to the health, sanitation and welfare of the inhabitants of the city.
(Code 1977, § 8-2098)
Sec. 8-2099. - Vacancy defined.
(a)
Any person who owns a building or structure in the City of Atlanta which, by its continued vacancy, is subject to an unauthorized entry by other persons and has sheltered non-owners or non-tenants, shall be subject to the nuisance abatement procedures hereinafter set forth in this article.
(b)
Vacancy, as used in this section, shall be rebuttably presumed to occur in any structure or building when such structure or building has no visible signs of human habitation, as opposed to occasional human use by non-owners and/or non-tenants, for a period of 15 continuous calendar days; and where such structure or building is in a dilapidated condition, including but not limited to, broken window panes, broken doors, unsecured doors and any other physical condition that might make an unauthorized entry possible without force. This definition of vacancy shall not preclude any judge from finding that any such building or structure is vacant under any other legally acceptable concept of vacancy.
(Code 1977, § 8-2099)
Sec. 8-2100. - Inspection, required, notice; abatement procedure.
The enforcement officer may, either upon his/her own authority or upon a complaint of one or more residents of the City of Atlanta, cause an inspection of any building or structure in the City of Atlanta to be conducted. This section shall not be construed to require both an enforcement officer acting on his/her own authority and receiving a resident complaint to cause said inspection. If, in the event the mayor or his appointed designee should find that a condition or conditions exist which would bring such building or structure within the definition of a nuisance as set forth in section 8-2099 above, he shall cause a notice by certified mail to be sent to the owner of record of property. Said notice shall enumerate the conditions which, in the opinion of the mayor or his designee, cause the building or structure to constitute a nuisance; shall enumerate the actions which such person should take in order to abate the nuisance; and shall advise such person that any subsequent entry by non-owner or non-tenant shall subject him to the City of Atlanta's Nuisance Abatement Ordinance. In the event that there is a subsequent unauthorized entry, the owner shall again be notified by certified mail of the entry and of the action which should be taken in order to abate the nuisance. In the event that the person so notified for the second time shall have failed to take the necessary steps which, in the opinion of the mayor or his designee, constitutes the abatement of the ordinance within 14 days of the date of the second notice, he or his designee shall be authorized to take the following action to abate said nuisance:
(1)
Cause a citation to issue to any resident owner of any property, requiring the owner of the property to appear in the Municipal Court of the City of Atlanta on a day certain to answer the charges of maintaining a nuisance;
(2)
Cause the City Attorney of the City of Atlanta to proceed in any appropriate Superior Court of the State of Georgia having the proper venue to try and determine the cause, in the event the owner is a non-resident of the City of Atlanta but a resident of the State of Georgia; or
(3)
Cause the city attorney to institute the proper proceeding in any appropriate court of the State of Georgia against a non-resident of the State of Georgia in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Georgia governing personal jurisdiction over non-residents of the state.

Sec. 8-2100.1. - Abatement; court order.
(a)
In the event that the trial judge finds that the owner of any such building or structure in the City of Atlanta is maintaining a nuisance as set forth in section 8-2098 hereof, he shall, in accordance with the provisions of section 72-401, Ga. Code Ann., be authorized to make a finding that such building or structure does constitute a nuisance, and, if such is found to exist, he shall order its abatement. The power to order the abatement of such nuisance shall include the power to frame any such order that the ends of justice require and shall include the power to order the owner to repair the building or structure to the extent entry could only be obtained through a forcible unauthorized entry, or to order the demolition of any such building or structure.
(b)
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the trial judge from granting an appropriate amount of time, as adduced from evidence presented, in which to allow the owner to abate a judicially determined nuisance.
(c)
Nothing herein shall be construed so as to place a limitation upon the power of any superior court judge when proceedings are instituted pursuant to section 8-2100(b) above.
(Code 1977, § 8-2100.1)
Sec. 8-2100.2. - City undertaking abatement.
In the event that the owner of any such building or structure has not taken the appropriate action as contained in the order to abate the nuisance within the time provided for in the order, the mayor, or his designee, may cause the abatement of the nuisance found to exist by the trial judge to the extent of the trial judge's order to abate.
(Code 1977, § 8-2100.2)
Sec. 8-2100.3. - Cost to city; lien on property.
The amount of the cost of having the nuisance abated by the city, either by contract with a third party or by employees of the city, shall constitute a lien upon the building or structure, and the property upon which it stands, for which execution may issue as for property taxes in accordance with any present or future law of the State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Atlanta, governing tax enforcement and collection.
(Code 1977, § 8-2100.3)
Sec. 8-2100.4. - Relation to other ordinances.
Nothing contained in any of the above six sections shall be construed so as to constitute a repeal of any existing law of the city; but rather, this article shall be construed in pari materia with all other ordinances of the city dealing with the conditions of buildings and other structures located within the City of Atlanta.

Cross reference— Housing code text, app. E.
Sec. 8-2182. - Barrier-free requirements.
(a)
Statement of Intent. The provisions of this section are specifically enacted to further the policy of the city to provide that new single-family, duplexes and triplexes which are constructed with public funds, as herein described, be provided with design features to provide accessibility and usability for physically disabled people. The purpose of this section is to specifically promulgate certain standards which may be less restrictive than ANSI A117.1 while economically providing solutions to accessibility.
(b)
Applicability. The following regulations shall be applicable to new single-family dwellings, duplexes, and triplexes which receive city assistance. For purposes of this section, "city assistance" shall mean funding or assistance from the city or any agency thereof, through any of the following means: (i) receipt of a building contract or similar contractual agreement involving any city-funded program or fund, including but not limited to the Urban Residential Finance Authority (URFA), the Housing Trust Fund, or similar programs; (ii) real estate purchased, leased or donated from the city or any agency thereof; (iii) receipt of preferential tax treatment, bond assistance, mortgage assistance, or similar financial advantages derived from the city or any agency thereof; (iv) dispersal under city auspices of any federal or state construction funds as CDBG; or (v) receipt of any other funding or financial benefit from the city or any agency thereof.
(c)
Design Requirements. The following design requirements shall apply:
Requirement 1. Building entrances. Applicable dwelling units shall be designed and constructed to have at least one building entrance on an accessible route served by a ramp complying with ANSI A117.1-1986, section 4.8, having a maximum slope not to exceed twelve (1:12), unless it is impractical to do so because of terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. Such building entrance doors shall comply with ANSI A117.1, 4.13, and shall have a minimum clear opening of 32 inches.
Any entrance at the front, side or back of the dwelling is acceptable as long as it is served by an accessible route such as a garage or sidewalk.
Requirement 2. Interior door criteria. All dwelling units, whether or not on an accessible route, shall be designed in such a manner that all the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons in wheelchairs. Lever hardware is required.
Doors, except those serving closets less than 15 square feet in area, within individual dwelling units intended for user passage must provide minimum 32″ clear opening. A 2′-10″ door or standard 6′-0″ sliding patio door assembly is deemed sufficient to comply with this requirement; provided however, compliance with ANSI section 4.13.6 (Maneuvering Clearance at Doors) shall not be mandatory.
Requirement 3. Accessible routes into and through the dwelling unit. An accessible route shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that a 36″ wide level route, except at doors, must be provided through the main floor of the unit with ramped or beveled changes at door thresholds.
Requirement 4. Wall reinforcement in bathrooms. Reinforcement in the walls shall be provided at designated locations as specified by ANSI A 117.1, section 4.24, section 4.32, figure 48 and figure 49 so that grab bars may be installed, if needed, at a later date without the necessity of removing portions of the existing wall.
Requirement 5. Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls. All applicable dwelling units shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that all premises contain light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other controls in accessible locations.
Controls shall meet the requirements of ANSI A117.1, section 4.25. Where multiple controls serve the same elements (e.g., two remote switches for a light) only one need be accessible.
(d)
Contracts. The provisions of this section shall be incorporated in all city contracts.
(e)
Waiver of Exterior Disability Accessibility Regulations. The requirements of subsection (c), requirement 1 (Building Entrances) herein may be waived by the commissioner of housing, through the issuance of an "Exterior Disability Accessibility Waiver" ("waiver").
A person requesting said waiver shall file an application for disability accessibility waiver with the commissioner, including all documents necessary to prove the existence of the exemption standard herein. The application shall demonstrate that topographical conditions on the site render it impossible to comply with the provisions of subsection (c).
If the application so demonstrates, the commissioner shall issue an exterior disability accessibility waiver to the applicant, in writing, within ten days of receipt of a completed application, which shall become an official component of any issued contract. The commissioner shall retain a copy of said waiver in the department's official records, and shall also forward a copy of said waiver to the director, bureau of buildings at the time of issuance.
