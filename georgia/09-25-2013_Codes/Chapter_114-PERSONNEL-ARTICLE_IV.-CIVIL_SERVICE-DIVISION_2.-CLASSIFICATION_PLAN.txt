Sec. 114-106. - Reclassification of positions.
(a)
Established positions in the civil service may be changed from one class to another where the following conditions are found to exist:
(1)
Significant changes have occurred in the actual duties and responsibilities.
(2)
Such changes in duties and responsibilities are of a permanent nature.
(3)
There are new or added elements in the job, rather than changes in the performance of the individual.
(b)
Reclassifications shall not be effected where the following conditions are found to exist:
(1)
The added duties and responsibilities are minor in nature and would be a logical function of the class.
(2)
The added duties and responsibilities are to be performed for a temporary period only.
(3)
The primary purpose of the reclassification would be to raise the employee's salary.
(c)
All such reclassifications shall be forwarded to the committee on finance of the Council for budgetary and financial implications. Reclassification requests should be accompanied by a written statement justifying the reason and need for the proposed action and approved by ordinance. If the action results in an increase in budget, approval is required by ordinance.
(d)
If reclassification of a position should result in the creation of a position in a class possessing a higher grade than that of the original classification, such change of position shall be considered a promotion. The promotional vacancy shall be filled as provided in this article, and the incumbent shall be given the opportunity to compete for the position. Should the incumbent fail the competitive, promotional examination or for some other valid reason not be promoted to fill the vacancy, the commissioner of human resources, with the approval of the employee's department head, may allow the employee to remain in the original position until such employee can, after passing an appropriate examination, be transferred to the same or another class of employment in the same or another department in which a vacancy shall exist. If no such vacancy should exist or if such transfer cannot for good reason be effected, the commissioner of human resources, with the approval of the employee's department head in accordance with this article, may lay off such incumbent or invoke a non-disciplinary demotion to a lower existing vacancy. No examination shall be required if the demotion is made to a lower related classification.
(e)
If reclassification of a position should result in the creation of a position in another class possessing the same pay grade as that of the original classification, the position, if vacant, shall be filled as provided in this article. Should there be an incumbent in the position, the incumbent employee shall receive a corresponding change in title without examination, provided that the reclassified position is in the same line and character of work and involves the same basic duties, responsibilities and skills. The incumbent employee of the position so reclassified, shall maintain the same pay grade and salary. Otherwise, the incumbent must pass an appropriate noncompetitive examination in order to continue employment in the reclassified position. If the incumbent employee fails to qualify for the reclassified position or for some other valid reason is not appointed to fill the vacancy, such employee receive a non-disciplinary demotion, as provided for in section 114-128
(f)
If reclassification of a position should result in the creation of a position of a lower class and pay, the incumbent of the position being reclassified shall be notified, and every effort shall be made to transfer the employee to another classified position, which would support the incumbent's classification and level and for which the incumbent would qualify. If such transfer or reassignment cannot be effected, the incumbent shall receive a non-disciplinary demotion, as provided for in section 114-128
(g)
In all cases where a layoff or reclassification downward occurs as a result of the reclassification of a position, the name of the employee affected by the layoff or demotion shall be entered on a priority placement register.
