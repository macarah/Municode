(c)
Development Under Existing Permit. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been applied for or issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to development impact fees pursuant to this chapter so long as the building permit remains valid and construction is commenced and diligently pursued according to the terms of the building permit.
(d)
Project Improvements. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from requiring a developer to construct reasonable project improvements in connection with a development project.
(e)
Phasing of Fees. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, transportation impact fees shall become effective upon adoption and approval of this chapter. Parks and recreation impact fees and public safety impact fees shall become effective on July 1, 1993.

Sec. 19-1008. - Requirements for assessment and calculation of impact fees—Generally.
(a)
Time of Assessment. All development impact fees shall be assessed as a part of the building permit application process.
(b)
Basis of Calculation. Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development.
(c)
Certification of Fee. Any person who, after the effective date of this chapter, intends to engage in development may request a certification of fee from the director by submitting plans for the development to the director. The fee so certified by the director shall be based upon submitted development plans and shall be binding upon the parties as to the fee to be assessed for such development for a period of 180 days from the date of certification. Any change in the proposed development plan that in any way effects said fee calculation shall void the certification of the fee.
(d)
Construction/Dedication in Lieu of Fee. In lieu of all or part of a development impact fee, the city may accept an offer from a developer to construct improvements or to contribute or dedicate land or money as provided in section 19-1014 of this chapter. Any such offer must comply with the requirements of section 19-1014 of this chapter. The "in lieu" portion of any development impact fee represented by construction of improvements shall be deemed paid when the construction is completed and accepted by the city for maintenance or when the person claiming such credit posts security for the cost of such construction as provided in section 19-1014(a)(3) of this chapter. The "in lieu" portion of a development impact fee represented by land dedication shall be deemed paid when the title to said land has been accepted by the city.
(e)
Recoupment of Excess Capacity. In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee shall also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements, but only to the extent that such public facilities have excess capacity and new development as well as existing development will be served by such facilities.
(f)
Effect of Multiple Buildings. When development for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two (2) or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two (2) or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure.
(g)
Specification of Land Use. In the event that a building permit application proposes a use that does not directly match an existing land use type upon which fees are based, the director shall assign the proposed use to the existing land use type that most closely resembles the proposed use.
(h)
Actual Cost Recovery Only. Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.
When a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use or building requires the issuance of a building permit, the development impact fee shall be based on the difference between the impact fee calculated for the previous use and the impact fee calculated for the proposed use. Should a redevelopment or modification of an existing use or building that requires the issuance of a building permit but does not involve a change in use result in a net increase in gross floor area, the development impact fee shall be based on said net increase. Should a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use or building result in a net decrease in gross floor area or calculated impact fee, no refund or credit for past development impact fees paid shall be made or created.

Sec. 19-1009. - Imposition of transportation impact fees.
(a)
Declaration of Service Area and Level of Service.
(1)
The service area for transportation facilities with respect to which transportation impact fees are assessed under this section 19-1009 is hereby declared to be all of the territory included within the corporate limits of the city.
(2)
The level of service for transportation facilities is hereby declared to be equal to a VMT/VMC ratio of three-fourths (0.75) for the major road network system.
(b)
Applicability of Fee.
(1)
Any person who after the effective date engages in development within the service area identified in subsection 19-1009(a) hereof shall pay a transportation impact fee in the manner and in the amount set forth in this chapter.
(2)

(c)
Calculation: Transportation Impact Fee Schedule.
(1)
Fee formula. Transportation impact fees set forth in the schedule provided in paragraph (2) below have been calculated using the following formula:
Formulate to Calculate Net Impact Cost per Unit of Development:
EXPAND
Net impact cost = Local impact cost - Property tax credit
Local impact cost = Travel demand × Local impact cost/VMT
Travel demand = 1-way PM peak hour trips × New trips factor × trip length
Local impact cost/VMT = Total Impact cost/VMT × local share cost
Total impact cost/VMT = Capital cost/VMC divided by VMT/VMC ratio
Property tax credit = Market value × property tax credit rate
  Where:
Capital cost/VMC is the average capital cost to construct an additional vehicle-mile of capacity at LOS D; it has been calculated to be $1,495.
VMT/VMC ratio is the adopted level of service, defined as the system-wide ratio of vehicle-miles of travel to vehicle-miles of capacity; the adopted ratio is three-fourths (0.75).
Local share cost is the share of anticipated local funding to finance roadway system improvement in the 15-year capital improvement program; calculated to be 57.9 percent.
The terms used in this paragraph (1) are further described in the impact fee study.
(2)
Transportation impact fee schedule. Unless an independent fee determination is requested in accordance with section 19-1012, the transportation impact fee shall be determined by the schedule attached hereto as Attachment 1A, "Transportation impact fee schedule," which by this reference is incorporated herein:
a.
The fee shown in Attachment 1A, "Transportation impact fee schedule," shall be reduced by 50 percent to reflect increased transit usage and reduced travel demand in the vicinity of MARTA stations. This fee reduction shall apply only to projects within 1,000 feet of a MARTA station, measured from property line to property line along a legal and practical pedestrian route.
b.
References in the transportation impact fee schedule to square feet refer to gross floor area, as defined herein.
c.
If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed land use types, the transportation impact fee shall be determined according to the transportation impact fee schedule by apportioning the gross floor area committed to each land use type specified in the schedule.
d.
If the type of development for which a building permit is applied is not specified in the fee schedule, the director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. If the director determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule, the director shall use the formula set forth in subsection 19-1009(c)(1) above and appropriate travel demand factors (average daily trips, one-way, average trip length and new trips factors) derived from the Institute of Transportation engineers trip generation manual, reports appearing in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Journal, or other reliable sources.
e.
If the transportation impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. If the original calculation resulted in a fee that was too high, the difference shall be refunded to the feepayor. If additional development impact fees are owed, no permits of any type shall be issued by the city for the building or use in question, or for any other part of a development project of which the building or use in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid and the director may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees, including but not limited to revocation of building permits and/or certificates of occupancy.

(2)
The level of service for parks and recreation facilities is hereby declared to equal to five and seventy-five one hundredths (5.75) acres per 1,000 functional population, as described and calculated in the impact fee study.
(b)
Applicability of Fee.
(1)
Any person who after the effective date engages in development within the service areas identified in Attachment 2 shall pay a parks and recreation impact fee in the manner provided in this chapter.
(2)
No building permit for any development requiring payment of a parks and recreation impact fee pursuant to this chapter shall be issued by the city unless and until the parks and recreation impact fee has been paid.
(c)
Fee Formula. Parks and recreation impact fees under this chapter shall be calculated using the following formula, as more fully described in the impact fee study:
Functional population per unit × 0.00575 acres per functional population × capital cost per acre × discount factor = Development impact fee; where the discount factor shall be 0.50 for all service areas.
(d)
Parks and Recreation Impact Fee Schedule. Unless an independent fee determination is requested in accordance with section 19-1012, the parks and recreation impact fee shall be determined by the schedule attached hereto as Attachment 1B, "Parks and Recreation Impact Fee Schedule," which by this reference is incorporated herein.
If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed land use types, the parks and recreation impact fee shall be determined according to the parks and recreation impact fee schedule by apportioning the gross floor area committed to each land use type specified in the schedule.
If the type of development for which a building permit is applied is not specified in the fee schedule, the director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. If the director determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule, the director shall use the formula set forth in subsection 19-1010(c) above.
If the parks and recreation impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. If the original calculation resulted in a fee that was too high, the difference shall be refunded to the feepayor. If additional development impact fees are owed, no permits of any type shall be issued by the city for the building or use in question, or for any other part of a development project of which the building or use in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid, and the director may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees, including but not limited to revocation of building permits and/or certificates of occupancy.
(Code 1977, § 19-1010)

If the director determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule, the director shall use the formula set forth in subsection 19-1011(c) above.
If the public safety impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. If the original calculation resulted in a fee that was too high, the difference shall be refunded to the feepayor. If additional development impact fees are owed, no permits of any type shall be issued by the city for the building or use in question, or for any other part of a development project of which the building or use in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid, and the director may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees, including but not limited to revocation of building permits and/or certificates of occupancy.
(Code 1977, § 19-1011)
Sec. 19-1012. - Independent fee determinations.
Independent fee determinations of development impact fees may be established as follows:
At their option, applicants for development approval may petition the director or his designee for independent fee determinations of development impact fees due for their project.
Independent Fee Study. If a feepayor opts not to have the development impact fee determined according to the applicable schedules, then the feepayor shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee study for the development for which a building permit is sought.
(1)
The independent fee study with respect to transportation impact fees shall include documentation of the travel demand characteristics (average daily trips, average trip length and new trips factors) for the proposed use. This documentation shall be according to the prescribed methodology and format established by the director.
(2)
The independent fee study may also include documentation of the estimated assessed property value of the development for the purpose of determining appropriate property tax credits. However, if the independent fee study does address assessed property value, the accompanying study of travel demand characteristics shall be based on a survey of projects of comparable property value.
(3)
The director shall determine the appropriate development impact fee based on the results of the independent fee study and the applicable development impact fee formula established in the chapter.
(4)
All independent fee assessments shall be presented for review and claimed at the time of application for a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived.
(5)
Where the director approves the independent fee assessment, the fee so established shall be binding upon the feepayor and all successors in interest to said feepayor.
(6)
Upon request for an independent fee determination, a nonprofit educational facility may be constructed, redeveloped, or modified solely for educational uses without payment of development impact fees provided the independent fee study submitted with said request demonstrates that said construction, redevelopment or modification will produce no net increase in that school system's total student enrollment.
Nature and Source of Data. Each independent fee study shall:
(1)
Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering and/or planning data, or be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area by qualified professionals in the respective fields and shall follow accepted professional practices and methodologies; and
(2)
Comply in all respects with the requirements of this chapter and be organized in a manner that will allow the director to readily ascertain said compliance; and
(3)
Comply with all other written specifications as may be required by the director from time to time.
Certification of Fee. Any development impact fee calculated in accordance with this section 19-1012 and approved and certified by the director shall be valid for 180 days following the date of certification. Following such period, a new application for an independent fee assessment must be made. Any change in the submitted development plan that in any way effects said fee calculation shall void the certification of the fee.
(Code 1977, § 19-1012)
Sec. 19-1013. - Accounting for fees.
(a)
Accounting for Fees. All development impact fee proceeds collected pursuant to this chapter shall be accounted for and invested as directed by the chief financial officer of the City of Atlanta. Restrictions on the investment of such funds shall be the same that apply to investment of all city funds generally.
(b)
Separate Accounting Required. Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each service category of impact fees within each service area wherein development impact fees are collected.
(c)
Investment Earnings. Investment earnings derived from invested development impact fees shall be subject to all restrictions placed on the use of development impact fees under this chapter and under the Act.
(d)
Expenditures.
(1)
Expenditure of development impact fees shall be made only for the category of system improvements within the service area for which the development impact fee was assessed and collected.
(2)
Except as provided in subsection 19-1013(d)(4) and subsection 19-1013(e) of this section 19-1013, development impact fees shall not be expended for any purpose that does not involve building or expanding system improvements that create additional capacity available to serve new growth and development. Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected.
(3)
No funds shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance or for any purpose not in accordance with the requirements of section 36-71-8 of the Act.
(4)
Except as set forth in this section 19-1013, development impact fees collected by the city to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements may be spent only on the same category of public improvements and within the service area in which they were collected.
(e)
Expenses of Administration. An amount not to exceed three percent (3%) of the total of all development impact fees collected may be allocated and applied for administration of this chapter.
(f)
Annual Reports. By June 30th of each year the department of finance shall prepare and present to the mayor and council an annual report describing the amount of any development impact fees collected, encumbered and spent during the preceding year by category of public facility and service area.
(g)
Payment of Bonds. Development impact fees may be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes or any other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance the category of public facilities in the service area for which such fees were collected.
(h)
Accounting for Recoupment Fees. That portion of development impact fees imposed by the city pursuant to subsection 19-1008(e) hereof to recoup, on a proportionate basis, improvement costs incurred by the city in the provision of excess capacity, shall be accounted for in a recoupment account and may be applied as necessary to reimburse the city for development impact fees that are waived pursuant to section 19-1016 hereof, with respect to affordable housing units and economic development projects. As initially adopted, parks and recreation impact fees for the Northside, Southside and Westside service areas and public safety impact fees are recoupment fees, and exemptions from these fees shall not require reimbursement of the respective impact fee accounts. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the chief financial officer (CFO) shall determine a percentage of total recoupment fees anticipated to be collected that will be necessary to reimburse nonrecoupment impact fee accounts for anticipated exemptions during the course of the year, and the CFO may periodically revise this percentage. All such recoupment fees collected shall be placed in a recoupment account to cover said exemptions. Provided further that monies accumulated in a recoupment account in excess of what is necessary for reimbursement for waived fees may be used for any public purpose not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act.
The provisions of this section shall be administered by the department of finance.
(Code 1977, § 19-1013)
Sec. 19-1014. - Credits.
(a)
Policies. The following requirements shall apply to all credits against development impact fees otherwise permitted by this section:
(1)
No credits shall be given for project improvements.
(2)
Except for reimbursements allowed pursuant to subsection 19-1014(d)(4), credits shall be allowable and payable only to offset future development impact fees and shall not result in reimbursement from, nor constitute a liability of, the city.
(3)
Credits shall be given only for the present value of any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee was imposed, except where further specific restrictions are set forth in this section. Any transfer or assignment of credits shall be expressly stated in writing, and in the absence of an express transfer or assignment of the right to any credit, the credit shall be deemed "not to run with the land."
(4)
In the event that any development impact fee schedule is subsequently changed to reflect increases in construction costs or other relevant factors, a credit holder may request a recalculation of credits to fairly reflect such changed circumstances. In the event that any development impact fee schedule is subsequently changed to reflect decreases in construction costs or other relevant factors, the city may recalculate such credits to fairly reflect such changed circumstances.
(5)
Any claim for a credit that is based upon any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money which was required or accepted by the city prior to the effective date shall be treated as a pre-ordinance credit regardless of the actual date of acceptance of the construction, contribution or dedication by the city.
(b)
Computation of Credits. All credits shall be computed in accordance with the requirements set forth in this subsection.
(1)
The present value of cash contributions shall be based on the face value of the cash payment at the time of contribution.
(2)
For the present value of any contribution or dedication of land accepted for system improvements by the city from the developer, or his predecessor in title or interest, the value of contributed land shall be determined by the director based on a review of property appraisals applicable to the date of the dedication prepared by qualified professionals.
(3)
The present value of construction of system improvements shall be the present value of the lower of the value of the completed improvements based on an appraisal prepared by qualified professionals acceptable to the city, or the actual construction cost of the improvements. The cost or appraisal basis shall be adjusted to the date of actual construction or dedication.
(4)
The person claiming any credit shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and improvements, construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the computation of the credits claimed. The city shall have no obligation to grant credit under this section to any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the director may reasonably require. The director may accept appraisals from the developer that were conducted contemporaneously with the original dedication or construction if the director determines that said appraisals are reasonably applicable to the computation of credit due. The director shall accept subsequent appraisals only if conducted by a certified appraiser or otherwise approved by the director in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the director.
(5)
The city shall give credit only for construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money actually accepted by the city. Deposit of a check shall be deemed acceptance of cash by the city. Only land dedications formally accepted by the city council or accepted by operation of law shall constitute acceptance for purposes of computing credits under this section. System improvements shall be deemed to be accepted only if and when the commissioner of public works or other applicable official has determined that such improvements meet applicable city standards and agreed on behalf of the city to accept such improvements for maintenance. The acceptance of an offer of dedication of land shall not constitute acceptance of any improvements located thereon unless the action accepting the dedication or other applicable city ordinance shall so provide.
(6)
For the present value of any previously paid development impact fee, credit shall be equal to the amount of the development impact fee paid.
(7)
In making the present value calculation, the percentage rate used shall be that of a State of Georgia "A-rated" or better municipal bond sold at the bond sale nearest the date on which the present value calculation is made.
(c)
Time to Claim Credits.
(1)
Any person claiming a credit shall apply to the director to claim such a credit no later than the date of application for the building permit to which the person applying wishes to have the credit apply. Any portion of a credit not claimed by such date shall be deemed waived.
(2)
Any person claiming a pre-ordinance credit for construction, contributions or dedications pursuant to subsection 19-1014(e) shall file an application claiming the full amount of such credit with the director on or before April 1, 1994.
(3)
Any person entitled to a pre-ordinance credit for construction, contributions or dedications pursuant to subsection 19-1014(e) must utilize said credit within ten years of the effective date.
(4)
No credits of any kind shall be available for construction, contributions or dedications that occurred more than ten years prior to the effective date.
(5)
The time for persons entitled to a pre-ordinance credit for construction, contributions or dedications pursuant to subsection 19-1014(e), and limited by subsection 19-1014(c)(3) to 10 years from the effective date, is extended until March 26, 2007.
(d)
Post-Ordinance Credits/Reimbursements. Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer required or accepted by the city from the developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements subsequent to the effective date ("Post-ordinance credits") in accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
A person claiming post-ordinance credits shall submit to the director a project description in sufficient detail to allow the commissioner of the department of public works to prepare an engineering and construction cost estimate. A person proposing credit for system improvements shall present cost estimates and property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the director in determining the amount of the credit. All construction must be made in accordance with applicable city development and design standards. A person proposing post-ordinance credits for land dedication shall present the director with property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the director in determining the amount of credit. The director retains the right to determine the amount to be credited by causing to be prepared engineering and construction cost estimates and/or property appraisals for those improvements and/or right-of-way dedications.
(2)
All other requirements of this section 19-1014 are met.
(3)
In the event that post-ordinance credits are claimed prior to the completion of construction of the system improvements for which the post-ordinance credits is claimed, security to insure completion of the system improvements in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow agreement shall be posted with the city, made payable to the city in the amount approved by the director equal to 110 percent of the full cost of the construction of system improvements. If a system improvement will not be constructed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the city, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten percent compounded, for each year of the life of the security. The security shall be reviewed and approved by the city's chief financial officer prior to the acceptance of the security by the city.
(4)
In the event a developer contracts with the city to construct, fund, or contribute toward system improvements so that the amount of the post-ordinance credit created by such construction, funding or contribution is in excess of the development impact fee which would have been otherwise due and owing, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess contribution, funding, or contribution from, and to the extent that, funds from development impact fees for the same category of system improvements located in the service area which has benefited by such improvements are available, provided such system improvements are included in the capital improvements program of the comprehensive development plan. A developer who is a party to such a contract may apply for reimbursement only after completing all buildings or other private improvements shown on any approved or proposed plans of that developer within the service area and thereby exhausting all available development impact fee credit opportunities. The city shall reimburse the developer within 180 days after the date development impact fees from other development in the service area are received by the department of finance.
(e)
Pre-Ordinance Credits. Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer required or accepted by the city from the developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements prior to the effective date as set forth in subsection 19-1014(a)(5) ("Pre-ordinance credit") in accordance with the following requirements:
(1)
Said credits shall be applied only to development impact fees otherwise due for future development within the same service area and within the same category of system improvements.
(2)
All other requirements of this section 19-1014 are met.
(3)
The director shall deduct from the present value of the pre-ordinance credit the present value of the development impact fee that would have been charged for buildings or improvements within the project had this chapter been in effect on the date that the building permit(s) for construction of said buildings or improvements was filed, provided that said deductions will apply only to buildings or improvements for which a building permit was issued within ten years prior to the effective date.
(4)
The time for the director to deduct from the present value of the development impact fee the present value of the development impact fee that would have been charged for buildings or improvements within the project had this chapter been in effect on the date that the building permit(s) for construction of said buildings or improvements was filed and which is limited by subsection 19-1014(e)(4) to permits filed prior to ten years from the effective date is extended until March 26, 2007.
(f)
Abandonment of Building Permit. In the event that a developer pays a development impact fee and then abandons the building permit or other permit to which it was appurtenant without constructing the building or other improvement, the developer shall receive credit for the present value of any development impact fees paid. These credits shall be available only for use in payment of future development impact fees for the same lot or parcel of land for which they were originally paid.
