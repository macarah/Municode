Cross reference— Historic preservation program, § 6-4041 et seq.

Sec. 16-20.001. - Statement of intent.
Within zoning districts now existing or hereafter created, it is the intent of this chapter to permit in general areas of substantial historic, architectural, and/or cultural significance, or for individual buildings or sites designated as having such significance, the creation and regulation of the following categories of zoning protection:
(1)
Landmark Buildings and Sites;
(2)
Historic Buildings and Sites;
(3)
Landmark Districts;
(4)
Historic Districts; and
(5)
Conservation Districts.
The council finds that many buildings, sites and districts as herein defined, having a special character or a special historic or aesthetic interest or value, or representing the finest architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the city, have been destroyed or uprooted, notwithstanding the feasibility of preserving and continuing the use of such buildings, sites and districts, and without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to the people of the city of aesthetic, educational, economic and historic values represented by such buildings, sites and districts. In addition, distinct areas may be similarly uprooted or may have their distinctiveness destroyed, although the preservation thereof may be both feasible and desirable. It is the finding of the council that the standing of this city as the capital of government, culture, business and education and as a major tourist and convention center must be maintained and enhanced by preserving the historical and architectural heritage of the city and by preventing the destruction of such cultural assets.
It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy that the identification, protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of buildings, sites and districts of special character or of a special historic or aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, education and general welfare of the people. Accordingly, the public policy objectives of this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of such buildings, sites and districts which represent or reflect special elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, and architectural history;
(2)
To safeguard the city's historic, cultural heritage, as embodied and reflected in such buildings, sites and districts;
(3)
To stabilize and improve property values in such buildings, sites and districts;
(4)
To foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past;
(5)
To protect and enhance the city's attractions to tourists and visitors and thereby support and stimulate business and industry;
(6)
To strengthen the economy of the city;
(7)
To promote the use of buildings, sites and districts for the education, pleasure and general welfare of the people of the city;
(8)
To promote attention to sound design principles in areas of new development and redevelopment;
(9)
To raise the level of community understanding and expectation for quality in the built environment; and
(10)
To implement the Comprehensive Development Plan of the City of Atlanta.

Sec. 16-20.005. - Nominations.
(a)
Applications.
(1)
Authority to apply: Nominations initiated by the director do not require an application. Except for nominations initiated by the director, an application shall be required to begin the nomination process set forth in this section. The following persons are empowered to file an application with the director for the nomination of a building, site or district to any category of protection provided by this part: the Atlanta City Council; for buildings or sites, the owner(s) of the building or site to be nominated, or an authorized agent; for districts, the owners of at least 10 properties, or the owners of 10 percent of the total number of properties within the proposed district, whichever is less, for each proposed district. Applications required by this section shall not be construed as zoning amendment applications required in Code of Ordinances section 16-27.001 et seq.
(2)
Form of application. When required as set forth above, applications for nominations shall be in the following form: Applications by the city council shall be in the form of a resolution requesting that the director initiate a nomination. Applications by property owners shall be made on forms prescribed by the director and available to the public. No such owner application shall be deemed to be complete until all supporting documentation required in the nomination process has been provided in a form prescribed by the director. Further, all owner applications shall be verified by each owner or each owner's authorized agent.
(3)
Processing of application: After an application is received in proper form, the director shall begin the nomination procedures set forth in this part within a reasonable time after receipt based upon the availability of the research and information necessary for the nomination and the availability of staff resources.
(b)
Initiation of Nomination Process: The process of nomination is initiated by a written notice of intent to nominate a building, site or district to any category of protection provided by this part. Said notice, which shall be prepared and mailed by the director, shall be sent by first class mail to the owner or owners of each such building or site, or in the case of districts to each individual owner of property within such district. Said notice shall describe the building, site or district proposed for nomination, including its location and/or boundaries; shall specify the category of protection to which it is proposed for nomination; shall specify the existing zoning classification, and/or boundaries, and historic protection, if any; shall state that the property could be nominated to another category of protection during the nomination process; shall announce the time, date and place of the public hearing by the commission to consider said nomination; shall include a statement notifying the property owner(s) of the automatic interim controls provided for in subsection (c) below; and shall include a copy of the interim control ordinance. In addition to the written notice of intent to nominate which initiates the nomination process, the director shall also, at least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing before the commission, cause to be published a notice within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the city. This published notice shall state the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing. This published notice shall also include the location and/or boundaries of the property or properties, the existing zoning classification and historic protection, if any, the category of protection proposed, and a statement that the property could be nominated to another category of protection during the nomination process.
(c)
Interim Control:
(1)
Findings and purpose: The governing body finds that immediate but temporary interim controls prohibiting any alteration or demolition of any building or site for which a notice of intent to nominate has been mailed are required in furtherance of the city's comprehensive historic preservation program. Temporary preservation of the status quo is essential to effectively evaluate each proposed nomination and to allow consideration of appropriate designations of all proposed landmark or historic districts, buildings or sites, and to prevent circumvention of the intent of this part.
(2)
Control regulations: Therefore, any property or properties for which a notice of intent to nominate has been mailed shall receive the full legislative protection of, and be controlled by, the regulations governing that category of protection to which said property is proposed to be nominated, as specified in this part [section] and chapter 20 of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances governing protection and treatment of properties so categorized. Said protection shall become automatically effective without further action of any kind immediately upon the date and time that the director of the urban design commission mails the notice of intent to nominate required by subsection (b) above. Except as provided below, the period of this mandatory interim protection shall not exceed 120 days commencing on the date and time of the mailing of said notice of intent to nominate. This interim control period allows and is based upon approximately 45 days for public hearing, evaluation of, and action on the proposed nomination by the commission and approximately 75 days for public hearing and review by the zoning review board, action by the zoning committee, and final action by the city council and the mayor as specified in this part. This 120-day period may be extended by resolution of council only if said extension is due to delay in the legislative process and only for a period of time equal to any such delay, but in no event shall the total interim control period permitted by this section exceed a maximum of 180 days.
(3)
Enforcement: The director of the commission shall deliver a copy of each notice of intent to nominate to the director of the bureau of buildings at or before the time and date each notice is mailed by the director of the commission. The director, bureau of buildings shall immediately take all steps necessary to accomplish the requirements of this section, and is prohibited from accepting any application or issuing any permit of any kind for any building, site or district specified in each notice of intent of nominate, unless the director of the bureau of buildings certifies that such permits are necessary due solely to unanticipated emergency public safety reasons or are approved pursuant to a valid certificate of appropriateness as provided for in this part [section] and in chapter 20 of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances. Violations of this section shall be punishable as provided for in section 16-30.002 of the Code of Ordinances, as amended.
(d)
Preparation of Report: Prior to the commission's public hearing to consider any nomination(s) to any category of protection, the director shall conduct research and compile a written report in the nature of findings and recommendations regarding the historic, architectural and/or cultural significance of each proposed nomination. This report shall include a statement on each of the following to the extent that they apply to the proposed nomination(s):
1.
The criteria upon which the nomination of the building, site or district and its boundaries is based, including a finding that the proposed nomination either does or does not meet the minimum criteria required for nomination and designation;
2.
A description of the building(s) and/or site(s), as well as features of significance, including date of construction, architect or builder, and architectural style and materials used;

Sec. 16-20.006. - Designations.
(a)
Preparation of Designation Ordinance: Upon the nomination by the commission of any building, site or district to any category of protection provided by this part, the director of the urban design commission, in consultation with the bureau of planning, shall prepare a proposed zoning designation amendment accomplishing the intent of the resolution of nomination. For proposed Landmark or Historic District(s) the ordinance shall include proposed detailed regulations to be applied and which may be designed to supplant or to modify any existing regulations, including regulations pertaining to the use of land, buildings or structures within the districts, including any and all subareas of the districts according to section 16-20.005 of the Code of Ordinances. Such regulations may be drafted to require, for a particular district or its subareas, if any, certificates of appropriateness in addition to those required in section 16-20.007 of the Code of Ordinances. Such regulations may be prepared with the advice and assistance of the owner or owners of all such properties within the district, neighborhood groups, historic preservation groups, or other organizations or individuals qualified by interest, training and experience in achieving the objectives set forth in this chapter. The director shall present this proposed ordinance to the chair of the zoning committee for consideration.
(b)
Zoning Committee Action: Upon receipt of a resolution of nomination and proposed designation legislation, the zoning committee shall proceed at or before its next regular meeting to act upon the proposed designation ordinance.
The zoning committee may, by majority vote, modify any nomination by the urban design commission to another category provided that the reasons for such modification by the zoning committee shall be made a part of the record of the committee proceedings. The proposed designation ordinance, along with supporting documentation, shall then be presented by the chair of the zoning committee at the next regular meeting of the city council at which time said proposed ordinance shall be referred to the zoning review board for public hearing.
(c)
Public Hearing:
(1)
A public hearing on each proposed designation ordinance, except for Conservation Districts, shall be held by the zoning review board. Since the adoption by the city council and approval by the mayor of an ordinance that designates a building, site or district to any category of protection provided in this part except Conservation Districts is a zoning action which establishes either (1) an overlay zoning district with accompanying district regulations and map or (2) an overlay zoning regulation, notice as is provided in this chapter shall be followed for all such designation actions; provided however, that designation of Conservation Districts, and interim protection(s) afforded any property or properties pursuant to section 16-20.005(c) of the Code of Ordinances are not zoning actions and does not require the above-referenced notice and hearing procedures.
(2)
In addition to the requirements of chapter 27 of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances relating to amendments to the zoning ordinance, and prior to action by the zoning review board on any proposed designation of a building, site or district to any category of protection permitted by the chapter, except Conservation Districts, the department of community development, through the bureau of planning, shall evaluate each such proposed designation and shall also consider the following matters:
a.
City goals and policies as are contained in the comprehensive development plan;
b.
Impact of proposal on transportation, urban design, other planning and development goals and objectives of the city;
c.
Potential impacts of tax abatements and other financial incentives which may be available to the property owner to assist in preservation; and
d.
Potential impacts of tax abatements and other financial incentives on the city budget.
In conducting such evaluation, the department of city planning shall request assistance and information from other city departments and agencies, including the department of finance, as may be appropriate to the specific proposal under construction.
(d)
Final Action: After public hearing by the zoning review board, each proposed designation ordinance shall be returned to the zoning committee for action and then reported to the city council for final action.
(e)
Post-Adoption Actions:
(1)
Within 20 days after any designation ordinance becomes law, the director of the commission shall send to the owner or owners of record of each such property so designated, by first class mail, a copy of the ordinance, a statement of the regulations governing their property, and a statement of the economic incentive which may be available for their property.
(2)

(4)
The director of the commission may cause to be created a suitable plaque appropriately identifying each designated building, site or district. Such plaques shall be affixed to private property only with the written consent of the owner or owners of said property.

The bureau of buildings shall evaluate each such application in accordance with the standards contained in this section and will prepare a written evaluation and report. Said report shall be presented to the commission at or before the commission's initial public hearing on the application.
b.
Notice of public hearing: Notice of the public hearings required for type IV certificates shall be as is provided for in subsection (c)(2) above.
c.
Hearings on certificates: The commission shall hold an initial public hearing on every type IV certificate of appropriateness application within 45 days of receipt of the completed application required in subsection (3)a above. At such hearing, the commission shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of facts, documentation, and the expression of view by the applicant and any other person(s) desiring to be heard. Records of the hearing(s) shall be maintained as is required by subsection (b) above. At said hearing, one of the following procedural courses shall be followed:
(i)
For type IV applications based on a condition of a threat to public health and safety, the commission, after hearing from all interested persons, including the bureau of buildings, shall determine whether a certificate shall be granted based upon the standards for said applications set forth in this section.
Said decision shall be made in public within 21 days from the date the commission holds its initial public hearing and shall be made as is required by subsection (b)(9) above.
(ii)
For type IV applications based on a condition of unreasonable economic return, the applicant shall have the burden of showing that the property in question is incapable of earning a reasonable economic return in the absence of such a demolition in accordance with the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b above. As a part of the showing, the commission shall cause to be established a three-person economic review panel. Said economic review panel shall be comprised of three (3) real estate and redevelopment experts knowledgeable in real estate economics in general, and more specifically, in the economics of renovation, redevelopment and other aspects of rehabilitation.
The panel shall consist of one (1) person selected by the commission, one (1) person selected by the applicant and one (1) person selected by the first two (2) appointees. If the first two (2) appointees cannot agree on a third person within 30 days of the date of the initial public hearing, the third appointee shall be selected by the commissioner of the department of community development within five (5) days after the expiration of the 30-day period; and the commissioner shall notify the director in writing of his selection.
All of the evidence and documentation presented at the initial public hearing shall be made available to and reviewed by the economic review panel. Further, the commission shall announce at the initial public hearing that further evidence or documentation from any interested party may be made a part of the record by submitting such evidence or documentation to the director by a date certain, and the director shall transmit said materials to the economic review panel. The economic review panel shall convene at its discretion and shall review the evidence of unreasonable economic return in relation to the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b. The economic review panel may, in its discretion, convene a meeting to hear testimony or oral argument by any interested party, provided that notice for such meeting shall be as is provided for in subsection (c)(2) above. Within 45 days after the economic review panel is established, the panel shall complete an evaluation of unreasonable economic return, applying the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b and shall complete and forward a written report on this evaluation to the commission.
At the next regular commission hearing following receipt of the report from the economic review panel, the commission shall reconvene its public hearing to take final action on the application. If, after reviewing all of the evidence, the commission finds that said standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b are satisfied, the commission shall issue the appropriate type IV certificate of appropriateness, conditionally or otherwise. If the commission finds that the applicant has failed to present sufficient evidence that the standards and criteria are not satisfied, said certificate shall be denied. Provided, however, that the commission's decision shall be consistent with the conclusions reached in the economic review panel's report unless, based on all of the evidence and documentation presented to the commission, the commission finds by a vote of a three-fourths majority of a quorum present that the economic review panel acted in an arbitrary manner, or that their report was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact. Provided, further, however, that if the report of the economic review panel is that an economic hardship exists, then the commission may defer action on the certificate for a period of 90 days while the commission prepares or causes to be prepared a plan to save the building from demolition pursuant to subsection (4) below.
(4)
Preservation plan: After a finding by the commission that the conditions for either a threat to public health and safety or an unreasonable economic return have been met, the commission may, within 60 days, prepare or cause to be prepared a plan under which the subject building or site (1) is preserved in a manner to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, and (2) is capable of providing a reasonable economic return to the property owner(s). The plan may include complete or partial tax abatements, tax credits, authority for alteration or construction not inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter and other actions allowable by law.
This plan will be reviewed by the economic review panel to determine if the plan is capable of providing a reasonable economic return. If the commission does not produce a plan within 60 days, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. If the commission develops a plan which is judged by the panel as capable of earning a reasonable economic return, the commission may deny the certificate of appropriateness for demolition.
If a plan is developed, but the plan is deemed by the economic review panel as incapable of earning a reasonable economic return, the commission may, within 30 days of the decision of the panel, recommend to the mayor that the city or a willing private buyer acquire a specified appropriate protective interest, including obtaining title or easements in the building or site involved. If, within an additional 15 days, the city does not initiate eminent domain proceedings to obtain ownership of the appropriate protective interest and neither the city nor a private buyer has made a firm offer to enter into a contract with the owner to acquire such interest, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. The commission shall also issue a certificate of appropriateness if an offer is forthcoming but is not equal to or greater than the fair market value of the property immediately prior to designation adjusted for inflation between the time of designation and the time of application for a demolition permit.
The owner may reject any offer for purchase. However, the commission may deny a certificate of appropriateness if the owner rejects an offer which is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the property immediately prior to designation adjusted for inflation between the time of designation and the time of application for a demolition permit.
(5)
Salvage plan: In connection with any type IV certificate of appropriateness, the commission may prepare and submit to the applicant, at or before the issuance of any said permit, a salvage plan. Said plan may suggest salvage and preservation, for reuse in restoration elsewhere, specified classes of building materials, architectural details and ornaments, fixtures and the like. Also, in connection with any type IV certificate, the commission may require the preservation of trees, shrubs and other landscaping of substantial significance.
(Code 1977, § 16-20.008; Ord. No. 2003-08, §§ 1, 2, 1-28-03)
Sec. 16-20.009. - Same; further standards.
In deciding individual applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall be guided by the purposes set forth in section 16-20.001, by findings contained in ordinances designating buildings and sites for protection, by purposes and objectives which are contained within individual Landmark and Historic District regulations, and by findings contained in reports prepared in support of Landmark and Historic District regulations as are required in article D of chapter 4 of part 6. Furthermore, in considering whether to grant approval, conditional approval or denial of an application for a type II or type III certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall apply the following standards:
(1)
Every reasonable effort shall be made to adapt the property in a manner which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment.
(2)
The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3)
Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
(4)
Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object or site shall be kept where possible.
(5)
Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should reflect the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
(6)
Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment.
(7)
Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings, structures or sites shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the building, structure or site would be unimpaired.
(8)
Considerations on proposed moving of structures, in whole or in part, shall include the effect on the neighborhood from which the move is made. In general, where the structure forms a significant part of a complex of similarly meritorious buildings, preference shall be given to relocation on a site elsewhere in the district. Where the structure does not form part of such a complex, preference shall be given to removal to a location in which the addition will reinforce existing complexes of buildings of significant historic, architectural and/or cultural character.
(Code 1977, § 16-20.009)
Sec. 16-20.010. - Judicial review of decisions on certificates of appropriateness.
(a)
Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the commission on a certificate of appropriateness, or any officer, department or board of the city, may appeal from such decision to the Superior Court of Fulton County by filing with the clerk of said court a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully and distinctly wherein such decision is contrary to law. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the final decision of the commission is rendered.
(b)
Upon such filing, the clerk of Superior Court shall give immediate notice thereof to the executive director of the urban design commission. Within the time prescribed by law, the commission shall cause to be filed with said clerk a certified copy of the proceedings held before the commission, including a transcript of the evidence heard before the commission and the decision of the commission.
(c)
Thereafter at the next term of the Superior Court or in vacation upon 10 days' notice to the parties, the judge of such court shall proceed to hear and pass upon the appeal. In determining the questions presented by the appeal, the court shall determine whether the decision of the commission is correct as a matter of law.
(d)
The filing of an appeal in the Superior Court from a decision of the commission shall not ipso facto act as a supersedeas, but a supersedeas may be granted by the court upon such terms and conditions as may seem reasonable and proper.
(Code 1977, § 16-20.010)
Sec. 16-20.011. - Further provisions.
(a)
Inspections: The director shall from time to time inspect, in cooperation with a designee of the director, bureau of buildings, work undertaken pursuant to decisions of the commission. The director shall take all necessary and legal steps to assure conformity to the requirements thereof. In any cases where the director of the commission becomes aware of work being undertaken on any designated property without or in violation of a certificate of appropriateness, the director of the commission shall immediately notify the director, bureau of buildings, who shall issue an immediate stop-work order. Further, the director, bureau of buildings shall furnish the director of the commission a quarterly report concerning all designated properties, number and nature of inspections made, number of correction notices issued, and steps being taken to remedy violations.
(b)
Maintenance and Enforcement: The owner or owners, or the owner's agent, of each building or site designated to a category of protection pursuant to this chapter shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of such building or site and all interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause the exterior portion of such building or site to deteriorate, decay, or become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair. Further, said owner or owners shall keep in good repair all portions of the building or site which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause such portions to deteriorate, decay, or become damaged or otherwise fall into a state of disrepair. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other provisions of law requiring any such building or site to be kept in good repair. The director, bureau of buildings shall be responsible for the enforcement of the maintenance provisions contained within this section.
(c)
Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be construed to be the minimum requirements or maximum limitations, as the case may be, commensurate with promotion of the purpose of historic preservation. Whenever the requirements of these regulations are at a variance with the requirements of any other governmentally adopted statute, rule, regulations, ordinance or code, the most restrictive or that imposing the higher standard shall govern.
(d)
Penalties: Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided in section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Atlanta, as amended. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. The owner of any building, structure or site, or part thereof, where anything in violation of this chapter exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense.
(e)
Separability of Provisions: Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole or any section thereof other than the section or provision specifically declared to be invalid.
