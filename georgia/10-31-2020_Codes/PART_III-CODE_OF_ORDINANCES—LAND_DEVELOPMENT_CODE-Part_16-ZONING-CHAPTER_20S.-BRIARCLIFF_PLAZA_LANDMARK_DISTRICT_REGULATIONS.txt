Sec. 16-20S.004. - General regulations.
The following general regulations shall apply to all properties within the Briarcliff Plaza Landmark District, except where otherwise stated.
1.
General criteria. The Commission shall apply the standards set forth below only when the standards set forth elsewhere in Chapter 20S do not specifically address the application in whole or in part:
a.
A property shall be used for its historic purpose, in this case a neighborhood shopping center inclusive of commercial, retail, restaurant, service and entertainment establishments, or be placed in a new use authorized in Section 16-20S.005 using minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
b.
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and exterior spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
c.
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
d.
Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
e.
Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
f.
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
g.
Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
h.
Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
i.
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
j.
New construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
2.
The compatibility rule.
a.
The intent of these regulations is to ensure that alterations to existing structures are compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features in the district. To further that intent and simultaneously retain flexibility, the regulations provide a "compatibility rule" as follows:
i.
The elements in question that are not quantifiable shall be compatible with the contributing buildings on which it is located.
ii.
Where quantifiable, the element shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing building on which it is located.
b.
Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule."

Financial Hardship Exemptions.
a.
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the Commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner.
b.
In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes.
c.
If the Commission finds that the requirement of subsection (5)(b) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with each of the following factors, standards and criteria:
i.
The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner.
ii.
The Commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
(1)
The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
(2)
The availability, at present or in the future, or other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
(3)
The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations in comparison to the costs associated with achieving the same proposal without the district regulations;
(4)
The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and
(5)
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
iii.
The Commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. Appeals from a final decision by the Commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code Sec. 16-20.010.
