Cross reference— Historic preservation program, § 6-4041 et seq.
Sec. 16-20B.001. - Statement of intent.
The intent of establishing the regulations for the Druid Hills Landmark District is as follows:
(1)
To recognize the masterpiece of design that is the 1893 plan for Druid Hills created for Joel Hurt's "ideal residential suburb" by Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, a plan subsequently formalized by his sons, the Olmsted Brothers, and completed by the Druid Hills Corporation.
(2)
To preserve the environmental character and physical appearance of the area, including parkways, houses and buildings created during the 1895 to 1930 period of development; existing general landscaping features; and existing spatial relationships between the buildings and streets and to ensure that any new development is compatible with the present architectural and spatial attributes that prevail.
(3)
To preserve the residential character of the area except when nonresidential uses may be required to preserve houses and buildings built during the historically significant period of development and to ensure that redevelopment reflects and reinforces the exceptional features established in the original planning.
(4)
To ensure that new construction observes the general setback and height restrictions of the original development and is in harmony with the historic character of the district.
(5)
To ascribe special recognition to the manner in which the several churches contribute so substantially to the beauty of the district.
(Code 1977, § 16-20B.001; Ord. No. 2002-58, § 1, 7-9-02)
Sec. 16-20B.002. - Division into subareas.
The Druid Hills Landmark District is divided into three subareas for regulatory purposes. The three subareas are as follows:
(1)
The Ponce de Leon Corridor
(2)
Fairview Road
(3)
Springdale/Oakdale/Lullwater
(Code 1977, § 16-20B.002; Ord. No. 2001-92, § 5(Attach. C, Pt. 1), 1-25-01)
Sec. 16-20B.003. - General regulations.
The following general regulations shall apply to the entire district which includes (1) the Ponce de Leon Corridor; (2) Fairview Road; and (3) Springdale/Oakdale/Lullwater. Any proposed development shall require a certificate of appropriateness from the urban design commission and shall conform to the following regulations:
(1)
Minimum off-street parking requirements:
a.
Off-street parking will not be permitted in any front yard nor in any side yard within 50 feet of a street line, except for Moreland Avenue, where a 60-foot limit shall apply. For the purpose of this parking regulation, the front yard shall be that area between the street line and the forward line of the principal structure.
b.
No off-street parking shall be located within 20 feet of any lot line except as may be authorized by the Atlanta Urban Design Commission under section 16-20B.004(6).
c.
Parking space requirements: Parking areas on the lot with adequate access to a public street and with adequate circulation space shall be constructed of a material which will assure a surface resistant to erosion and shall be maintained permanently as follows:
1.
For multiple-family dwellings and two-family dwellings: Two (2) spaces for each dwelling unit.
2.
For single-family dwellings: Two (2) spaces per dwelling unit.
3.

A certificate of appropriateness shall be required for the clearance or removal of any tree with a caliper of four inches or greater and shrub massings or hedges over three feet high.
b.
All trees with a caliper of four inches or greater as measured four feet above the ground, outside of the building site which are cleared for any reason, shall be replaced with trees having a minimum caliper of one and one-half inches.
c.
A certificate of appropriateness shall be required for any major change in the landscape which is visible from the public right-of-way. Removal or changes in topography, walls (retaining or freestanding), and fences shall constitute a major change.
d.
The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for the conversion of any existing building for any permitted nonresidential use, where located adjacent to a residential use, may be conditioned upon the requirement of a suitable buffer by the urban design commission.
e.
Any construction in the Druid Hills Landmark District shall maintain the general landscaping scale and character reflected in the original development of Druid Hills in order to preserve the historic landscape character of the district. Landscape changes visible from the public right-of-way shall require a Certificate of Appropriateness and shall follow the standards set forth by the Secretary of the Interior. These standards, The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for the Treatment of Cultural Landscapes, are designed to assist individual property owners in the formulation of plans for maintenance and continued use of historic properties and landscapes.
(4)
Minimum drainage controls: Structures shall be located so as to preserve the natural terrain of the district. Proper drainageways shall be provided to prevent increased water runoff and erosion, siltation of streams or flooding of property as required by the department of public works.

No structure shall be permitted within any 100-year floodplain.
b.
No single-family structure shall be constructed on natural slopes greater than 25 percent.

Exterior architectural changes shall follow the standards set forth by the secretary of the interior. The secretary of the interior's standards for historic preservation projects are designed to assist individual property owners formulate plans for the development and continued use of historic properties. Separate guidelines are given for each of seven treatments. (Refer to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards of Historic Preservation Projects.)
