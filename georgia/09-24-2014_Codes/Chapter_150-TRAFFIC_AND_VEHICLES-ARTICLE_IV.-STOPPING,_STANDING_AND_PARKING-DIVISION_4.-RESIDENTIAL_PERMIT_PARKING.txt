Sec. 150-147. - Program established.
There is established a residential permit parking program, whereby motor vehicles bearing a special parking permit issued pursuant to this division may be parked in excess of the time limits posted on streets within certain areas known as residential permit parking areas. Parking a motor vehicle on a street within a residential permit parking area may be restricted to a two-hour period for an established 12-hour period in the vicinity of the traffic generator unless the motor vehicle displays such valid parking permit. All presently existing residential permit parking programs and all programs established in the future may opt into this two-hour non-permitted parking element through a petition process within the residential permit parking area to be established by the commissioner of the department of public works. Street signage in each residential permit parking area must contain language that reflects the residential parking permit hours, including the two-hour non-resident exception, if applicable.
