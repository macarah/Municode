Subarea 1—Downtown Core

(Ord. No. 2007-71(07-O-2221), § 1(Att. A), 11-27-07)
Sec. 16-18A.004. - Application procedures.
A special administrative permit (SAP) application and a specified number of copies each of a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning prior to an applicant filing for a building permit. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), modifications of outdoor dining, or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that alters the configuration of openings, shall be subject to said SAP approval. Before making an application for a special administrative permit, a pre-application conference between the applicant and the director of the bureau of planning or the director's designee is required to discuss the application and relevant requirements of these regulations. Said pre-application conference shall be held within 14 days of the request date by the applicant, unless a longer period is mutually agreed upon. All applications for a SAP shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to said SAP applications contained in Chapter 25 of Part 16 except as otherwise modified by this Chapter 18.
Where regulations require the approval of a SAP for other purposes so specified, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall, without additional application, include consideration of other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for such special exception or special use permit.
The director of the bureau of planning may exempt certain classes of applications for special administrative permits from detailed review requirements as set forth upon written findings that generally within these districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or scale as to make detailed reviews and approval by the planning director unnecessary. Where applications for special administrative permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful.
For the purposes of this chapter, a unified development plan approved under a single SAP and meeting all floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements, may be subdivided, even if the resultant parcels do not otherwise meet these requirements. Any changes from the approved SAP shall require a new or amended SAP, which shall be based on the geographic extent of the original SAP and shall meet floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements of such; and shall indicate built or planned improvements on all parcels. Where a single property owner no longer owns all parcels, the applicant shall obtain authorization from all property owners prior to permit submittal.
