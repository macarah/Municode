Potential offerors may submit the contractor affidavit to the department of procurement not less than ten days prior to the due date for responses to the solicitation. Submission of the contractor affidavit after that date will not extend the time for submitting offers and the department of procurement is not required to review contractor affidavits submitted less than ten days prior to the due date for responses to the solicitation.
(c)
The department of procurement will review the timely submitted contractor affidavits and provide potential offerors with the following:
(1)
A written acknowledgement of receipt of the potential offeror' s contractor affidavit;

(e)
Potential offerors that are deemed non-compliant must submit a compliant contractor affidavit on the due date for responses to the solicitation of offers in order to be qualified for evaluation.

However, the department of procurement shall not be required to change the due date for responses to the solicitation to accommodate a later due date for the contractor affidavit or the acknowledgement and determinations. In no event will the due date for the contractor affidavit be later than the due date for responses to the solicitation.
(g)
The determination of a potential offeror's compliance with the state's immigration compliance mandates shall not automatically deem that offeror's timely submitted offer to be responsive to any solicitation. Offerors must also be responsive to and compliant with other requirements set forth in the solicitation of offers, as well as all applicable laws. Untimely offers from compliant potential offerors shall not be eligible for award of the solicited contract.
(h)
Potential offerors that submit with their offer an incomplete or incorrect contractor affidavit or fail to submit a compliant contractor affidavit after a determination of non-compliance will not be qualified for evaluation and their timely submission of an offer may not be considered for the award of the solicited contract.

The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used.
(i)
Correction or withdrawal of bids.
(1)
Before bid opening. Correction or withdrawal of bids may be allowed by the chief procurement officer before the scheduled time and date of bid opening.

Notice of withdrawal shall be received by the chief procurement officer prior to bid opening.
(2)
After bid opening. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the offeror can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended.

The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document, but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
b.
The bidder submits evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made.
All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids shall be supported by a written determination made by the chief procurement officer.
(j)
Tie bids. If two or more offerors are tied in price while otherwise meeting all of the required conditions, the contract shall be awarded to an offeror whose principal place of business is within the city or, if not within the city, within the metropolitan Atlanta area or, if not within the city or metropolitan area, within the state. Where no offeror is located within the state, the chief procurement officer shall award the contract to the offeror whose principal place of business is the closest to the city.
(k)
Award. The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by written notice to the most responsible and responsive offeror whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In determining the most responsible and responsive offeror, the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the using agency, shall consider the following:
(1)
The ability, capacity and skill of the offeror to perform the contract and provide the services/supplies required;
(2)
The capability of the offeror to perform the contract and provide the services/supplies promptly or within the time specified without delay or interference;
(3)
The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the offeror;
(4)
The quality of performance of the offeror of previous contracts and provision of services/supplies;
(5)
The previous and existing compliance by the offeror with laws and ordinances relating to the contract and provision of services/supplies;
(6)
The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the offeror to perform the contract and provide the services/supplies;
(7)
The compliance of the offeror with the requirements of an equal employment opportunity in contracting program as may be required by ordinance;
(8)
When applicable, the compliance of the offeror with the requirements of a minority and female business enterprise participation program as may be required by ordinance;
(9)
The compliance of the offeror with the requirements of a local preference program as may be required by ordinance;
(10)
The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or services to the particular use required; and
(11)
The price. If all bids exceed available funds as certified by the chief financial officer and the most responsible and responsive bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent, the chief procurement officer is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including changes in the bid requirements, with the most responsible and responsive offeror in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds.
(l)
Multi-step sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those offerors whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
(m)
Substitution, replacement by uncertified minority business enterprise or female business enterprise prohibited. An offeror may not substitute for or replace any minority business enterprise (MBE) or female business enterprise (FBE), as those terms are defined in section 2-1443, when that MBE or FBE has been designated in writing by the offeror as a subcontractor for the contract on which the offeror has submitted a bid, if the MBE or FBE submitted as a part of the bid is not a certified, legitimate MBE or FBE, as determined by the office of contract compliance. If the office of contract compliance determines that the MBE or FBE is not legitimate or certified, the bid of the contractor who submitted the bid shall be rejected.
(n)
The office of contract compliance shall evaluate each such bid as to the offeror's compliance with subsections (k)(7) and (8) of this section and shall notify the chief procurement officer, in writing, whether the bid is responsive or nonresponsive.

Sec. 2-1188.1. - Local preference.
(a)
Applicability. This local preference program shall only apply to any city contract (referred to hereinafter as "Eligible local projects") procured under section 2-1188 competitive sealed bidding. It does not apply to procurements utilizing competitive sealed proposals under section 2-1189, small purchases under section 2-1190, sole source procurement under section 2-1191, emergency procurement under section 2-1192, competitive selection procedures for professional and consultant services under section 2-1193 and federally-funded projects.
(b)
Statement of policy. The city has a significant interest in encouraging the creation of employment opportunities for its residents and for businesses located within the city. As a purchaser of goods and services, the city will benefit from expanded job and business opportunities for its residents and businesses through additional revenues generated by its activities. It is in the interest of the city and its residents to give preference on eligible local projects to those eligible offerors who have direct physical and economic relationships with the city.
(c)
Certification as a local offeror. In order to be certified as a local offeror, an eligible offeror must submit a completed application to the department of procurement, and the applicant must be approved and certified by the department of procurement. An eligible offeror must submit a completed and signed written application to become a local offeror before it will be allowed to receive a bid preference on an eligible local project. In order to be approved as a local offeror and receive a bid preference on an eligible local project, the application for approval as a local offeror and all supporting documents must be received by the department of procurement at least 30 days prior to the date bids are received on such eligible local project. An eligible offeror who fails to submit an application for approval as a local offeror at least 30 days prior to the date bids are received on an eligible local project, and who otherwise meets the requirements for approval as a local offeror, will not be qualified for a bid preference on such eligible local project.
(d)
Criteria. To be certified as a local offeror, the eligible offeror must satisfy no less than two of the following criteria:
(1)
The eligible offeror's principal place of business is located in the city or that the eligible offeror has held a valid city business license for at least one year prior to the date of application.
(2)
A majority of the full time employees, chief officers, and managers of the eligible offeror have regularly conducted work and business in the city for at least one year prior to the date of application.
(3)
A majority of the employees based at the eligible offeror's location(s) in the city have been residents of the city for at least one year prior to the date of application.
(4)
The services the eligible offeror offers to the city have been provided by the eligible offeror in the city for at least one year prior to the date of application.
If the applicant is a joint venture or mentor-protรฉgรฉ team, each participant in the joint venture or mentor-protรฉgรฉ team must be approved independently as a local offeror in order for the joint venture or mentor-protรฉgรฉ team to receive the bid preference on eligible local projects.
(e)
Term. The certification as a local offeror shall expire two years from the date of the approval of the application. Following the expiration date, a business is no longer a local offeror. An eligible offeror must submit a new application for certification as a local offeror to the department of procurement and establish that it continues to meet the requirements contained in paragraph (d) of this section in order to receive a bid preference on eligible local projects.
(f)
Determining responsiveness of non-local offerors. The geographic location of an eligible offeror shall be one of the factors considered by the department of procurement in determining whether a bid on an eligible local project is responsive. A bid submitted by a non-local offeror shall be deemed non-responsive on the basis that the eligible offeror is a non-local offeror, unless:
(1)
For eligible local projects valued at less than $500,000.00, the amount of the bid submitted by the non-local offeror is ten percent lower than the lowest responsible and responsive bid submitted by a local offeror;
(2)
For eligible local projects valued at $500,000.00 or more, the amount of the bid submitted by the non-local offeror is five percent lower than the lowest responsible and responsive bid submitted by a local offeror;
(3)
The bid submitted by the non-local offeror would be responsible and responsive but for the fact that the eligible offeror is a non-local offeror; and
(4)
The amount of the bid submitted by the non-local offeror is lowest among bids submitted by other non-local offerors that would be responsible and responsive but for the fact that such other eligible offerors are non-local offerors.
(g)
Continuing obligations of eligible offerors certified as local offerors. Eligible offerors certified as local offerors shall be under a continuing duty to immediately inform the department of procurement in writing of any changes in the eligible offeror's business if, as a result of such ;changes, the eligible offeror no longer satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

The selection shall be made in order of preference. From the date proposals are received by the chief procurement officer through the date the contract is awarded, no offeror may make substitutions, deletions, additions or other changes in the configuration or structure of the offeror's teams or members of offerors' teams. The selection criteria shall include, but not be limited to, those contained in subsection 2-1188(k) and the following:

The combined weights may not exceed 15 percent of the total evaluation points.
When applicable, each request for proposal shall state with specificity the method by which EEO and EBO compliance is weighted to arrive at numerical evaluation points. Proposals that are noncompliant with the city's EEO or EBO requirements shall be deemed nonresponsive without further evaluation of any other solicitation evaluation factors.
(e)
Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of evaluation factors.
(f)
Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to proposals. Discussions may be conducted with responsible and responsive offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for any purpose in the best interests of the city, including the purpose of clarification to ensure full understanding of and responsiveness to the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals, and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining the best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.
(g)
Award. Award shall be made to the most responsible and responsive offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals, this section and in section 2-1188(k).
(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), ยง 4, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1190. - Small purchases.
(a)
General procedures. Any contract or purchase order for supplies, services and construction not exceeding $20,000.00 may be made in accordance with small purchase procedures adopted by the chief procurement officer in accordance with this article, provided that procurement requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase under this section. Insofar as it is practicable, no less than three businesses shall be solicited to submit quotations. Award shall be made to the business offering the lowest responsive quotation. The name of the business submitting a quotation and the date and amount of each quotation shall be recorded and maintained as a public record.
(b)
Authority of using agency. Heads of all city departments may, in their discretion, make small purchases without the assistance of the chief procurement officer under the following circumstances:
(1)
Where the purchase does not exceed $50.00 and is paid out of the petty cash fund allocated to the department under a duly enacted appropriation; and
(2)
Where the purchase does not exceed $20,000.00 and is paid for by a miscellaneous requisition directing the chief financial officer to make payment from funds previously allocated to such department.

(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), ยง 4, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1191. - Sole source procurement.
(a)
Under this article, a contract or purchase order for a supply service, construction item or professional or consultant service may be awarded without competition when the chief procurement officer determines in writing, after conducting a good-faith due diligence review of reasonable available sources, that are in the city's best interest, there is only one source for the required supply, service, construction item or professional or consultant service. The due diligence review shall include, but not be limited to, research of available sources and contact with professional and trade associations related to the required supply, service, construction item or professional or consultant service. The determination in writing shall also state the sources reviewed.
(b)
The chief procurement officer shall conduct negotiations as to the terms of the sole source procurement. A record of sole source procurements shall be maintained that lists each contractor's name, the name and type of each contract, the item(s) procured under each contract and the identification number of each contract file.
(c)
Subsequent to the execution of a sole source contract, the original sole source designee may not assign the contract to any other entity or individual unless the provisions of this subsection are satisfied. If the original sole source designee desires to assign the contract subsequent to its execution, it must make a request for assignment to the chief procurement officer and include with that request information concerning the proposed assignee. The chief procurement officer will review such request and information (including any additional information he/she may request) to determine if the assignee independently meets the sole source requirements of this section. If the chief procurement officer finds that the assignee meets the sole source requirements of this section, council must approve such assignment before it may become effective.
(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), ยง 4, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1191.1. - Special procurements.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the chief procurement officer may initiate a procurement above the small purchase amount specified in section 2-1190 where he/she determines that an unusual or unique situation exists that make the application of all requirements of competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposals contrary to the public interest and such procurement does not technically qualify as a sole source procurement under Code section 2-1191. If determined as appropriate by the chief procurement officer, any special procurement under this section shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances; provided however, that the chief procurement officer may determine under appropriate circumstances that there is only one logical choice as to a contractor to provide the goods or services necessitated by the special procurement. A written determination of the basis for the procurement and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included by the chief procurement officer in the contract file. Nothing in this section shall eliminate the chief procurement officer's obligation to present the recommendation of award of any contract procured under this section to city council for approval, prior to execution of the contract, when the value of the contract exceeds $100,000.00.
(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), ยง 4, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1192. - Emergency procurement.
(a)
When the chief procurement officer determines that an emergency exists, the chief procurement officer may make or authorize others to make emergency procurements for supplies, services, construction items or professional or consultant services. The chief procurement officer shall make such determination when there exists a threat to public health, welfare or safety under emergency conditions. The procuring agency shall endeavor to utilize existing contracts when addressing an emergency procurement, if appropriate. If using an existing contract is not appropriate or no existing contract provides the supplies, services, construction items or professional or consultant services needed for the emergency procurement then, the procuring agency shall conduct the emergency procurement with as much competition as is practicable under the circumstances.
(b)
The following information shall be included in the emergency procurement contract file:
(1)
An overview of the nature of the emergency, including relevant circumstances; and
(2)
A description of the threat to the health or safety of individuals, property, or essential city function if immediate action is not taken and an estimation of the potential material loss or damage; and
(3)
A summary of the contractor's qualifications, experience and background to provide the emergency service and the basis on which the contractor was selected over other qualified and responsive firms; and
(4)
A description of the scope of work, as well as the costs, fees, or rates for the purchase; and
(5)
A description of the work performed by the contractor to mitigate or eliminate the emergency, including a description of what consequences of what would have been if the emergency action had not been taken and the risk associated with inaction;
(6)
Pricing information when the contract award amount is over $100,000.00 or 20 percent over pre-emergency pricing (if such information is available to the using agency), whichever is less. If no pre-emergency pricing information is available, then the using agency will provide current industry pricing, when practicable.
(c)
If an emergency should arise after office hours which requires immediate action on the part of the using agency involved for the protection of the city or if a like situation arises on a Sunday or holiday and it is not possible or convenient to reach the chief procurement officer, any purchase necessary may be made by the official in charge of such using agency. The purchase shall be reported to the chief procurement officer within 24 hours. When the mayor declares a state of emergency and implements the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency and Disaster Operations Plan, Annex 10A, additional supplies and equipment needed shall be procured in accordance with the plan, using the most practicable method which will ensure both expeditious procurement and effective control.
(d)
(1)
Within 3 business days of executing the emergency contract, an authorizing agency must make the emergency contract information available for public inspection. The agency may either post the emergency contract on the agency website or post summary information, which includes directions for obtaining a copy of the emergency contract, on the agency website. Additionally, the department of procurement shall report the emergency contract information to the committee of purview by the next committee cycle following the three business day deadline.
The department will also disclose the document relating to the conflict of interest or the related party's disclosure information by the using agency.

Each using agency shall encourage professional and consultant firms, which desire to provide services to the agency, to submit statements of qualifications to the chief procurement officer. The chief procurement officer may specify a uniform format for statements of qualifications. Persons may amend these statements at any time by filing a new statement. Any person placed on the qualifications list shall be removed if found in violation of any provision of this article, including, but not limited to, division 11, 12 or 13, or if such person is found in default under any contract with the city.

The selection of the short-listed offerors shall be made in order of preference. From the date proposals are received by the chief procurement officer through the date the contract is awarded, no offeror may make substitutions, deletions, additions or other changes in the configuration or structure of the offeror's teams or members of offeror's teams prior to award. The selection criteria shall include, but not be limited to, those contained in subsection 2-1188 (k) and the following:
(1)
Previous experience demonstrating competence to perform work or services involved in the solicitation;
(2)
Past performance of previous contracts with respect to time of completion and quality of work;
(3)
The fee or compensation demanded for the services;
(4)
The ability to comply with applicable laws;
(5)
The ability to comply with the schedule of the commencement and completion of the services, as required by the city;
(6)
The financial ability to furnish the necessary bonds;
(7)
The financial condition of the offeror; and
(8)
The ability to provide staffing of management personnel, satisfactory to the city.
(9)
The offeror's compliance with the requirements of equal employment opportunity (EEO) and, where applicable, equal business opportunity (EBO), as may be required by ordinance. As part of the selection process, the office of contract compliance shall evaluate each proposal as to the offeror's compliance with the requirements of equal employment opportunity (EEO) and equal business opportunity (EBO) programs as may be required by ordinance. The office of contract compliance shall evaluate each proponent's conformance to the city's EEO ordinance and, where applicable, the city's EBO ordinance according to relative weights assigned by the chief procurement officer. The combined weights may not exceed 15 percent of the total evaluation points. Each request for proposal shall state with specificity the method by which EEO and EBO compliance is weighted to arrive at numerical evaluation points. Proposals that are noncompliant with the city's EEO or EBO requirements, where applicable, shall be deemed nonresponsive without further evaluation of any other solicitation evaluation factors.
(e)
Negotiations and award. The chief procurement officer shall negotiate a contract with the most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror at compensation that the chief procurement officer determines in writing to be fair and reasonable to the city. In making this decision, the chief procurement officer shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the chief procurement officer be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the offeror considered to be the most responsible and responsive at a price for the chief procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable to the city, negotiations with that offeror shall be terminated. The chief procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations with the second most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror. If negotiations with the second most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror are unsuccessful, negotiations shall be terminated and the chief procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations with the third most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror. Should the chief procurement officer be unable to negotiate a contract with any of the short-listed offerors, the chief procurement officer and the using agency may select from the additional offerors that were not short-listed in order of their responsibility and responsiveness and the chief procurement officer may continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.

The reasons therefore shall be made part of the contract file.

Determination of nonresponsibility. If an offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility setting forth the basis of the finding shall be prepared by the chief procurement officer.

(b)
Amount of bid security. Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least five percent of the amount of the bid. Unsuccessful offerors shall be entitled to the return of the bid security.

The chief procurement officer is authorized to reduce or waive performance and payment bonds for contracts for supplies and services for $20,000.00 or less, when the chief procurement officer makes a written determination that it is in the best interests of the city to do so. Nothing in this section prevents the requirement of such bonds on supply or service contracts under $20,000.00 when the chief procurement officer determines that the circumstances warrant.
(c)
Authority to require additional bonds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the city to require other security in addition to those bonds or in circumstances other than those specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
(d)
Right to institute suit on payment bond; jurisdiction and time limits for suits upon payment bonds.
