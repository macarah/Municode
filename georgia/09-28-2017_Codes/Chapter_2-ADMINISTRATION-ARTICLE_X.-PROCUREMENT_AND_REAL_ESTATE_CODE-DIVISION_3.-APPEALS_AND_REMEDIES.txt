DIVISION 3. - APPEALS AND REMEDIES

Sec. 2-1161. - Authority to resolve protested solicitations and awards.
(a)
Right to protest. Any actual offeror that has submitted a bid/proposal for a particular procurement and is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of the contract shall protest in writing to the chief procurement officer after the date that the specific bid or proposal is submitted. No protest will be accepted or considered prior to the date the specific bid or proposal is submitted; it will be considered untimely. All protests shall set forth in full detail the factual and legal bases for the protest and specific relief sought by the protestor. Protests arising from factual or legal bases that the protestor knew or should have known prior to the submission of the bid/proposal must be submitted within three days of the submission of the bid/proposal. Protests arising from factual or legal bases that the protestor knew or should have known subsequent to the date the bid/proposal was submitted must be submitted within ten days after the protestor knew or should have known of such bases, but in no event shall any protest be submitted more than ten days after the award of the contract. Untimely protests will not be considered by the chief procurement officer and will be simply denied as untimely.
(b)
Posting of protest security. Any actual offeror submitting a written bid/proposal that files a protest must, at the time of filing, post security in the amount of one percent of the financial offer of the protestor or, in the event the bid/proposal does not involve a fixed financial offer either in the form of payment of monies to the city or payment of monies to the offeror, $100,000.00, to be tendered in the form of a bond or certified check.
(c)
Application of protest security. If the chief procurement officer denies the protest, he/she shall assess against the protestor reasonable attorneys' fees and other administrative costs incurred by the city in reviewing and responding to the protest. If the city is represented by its law department, such fees and costs will be calculated at the hourly rate of each attorney participating in the review and response to the protest set forth in each attorney's most recent city paycheck times the number of hours worked by such participating attorneys on the protest, or if Georgia Law permits a greater hourly rate, such greater rate, plus all out of pocket costs of the city concerning the protest. If the city is represented by outside counsel, such fees and costs will be calculated at the billing rates of the firm's attorneys participating in the review and response to the protest, times the number of hours worked by such participating attorneys, plus all out of pocket costs of the firm concerning the protest. Within 15 days of denying the protest, the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the city's law department and outside counsel, if any, will calculate the city's cost in reviewing and responding to the protest and will apply the protester's bond or certified check to such costs. Any remaining balance of the bond or certified check will be returned to the protestor; provided, however, if the protester files an appeal of the city's denial of its protest pursuant to code section 2-1166, such certified check or bond will continue to be retained by the city to cover the costs of the city associated with such appeal.
(d)
Decision on protest. If a protest is timely filed, the chief procurement officer shall inform the protestor of the decision in writing within ten days or, if the chief procurement officer requires more than ten days to render a decision, will advise the protestor within the initial ten days of the additional amount of time required to render a decision on the protest.
(e)
Finality of decision. A decision under subsection (d) of this section is final and conclusive, unless fraudulent or the protestor, having the right to file under this division, files an administrative appeal with the procurement appeals hearing officer in accordance with this division.
(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 3, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1162. - Debarment or suspension from consideration for contract award.
(a)
Authority to debar or suspend. The chief procurement officer, after consulting with the city attorney, is authorized to debar a person for cause from participation in any city procurements at any tier and consideration for award of contracts. The debarment shall be for a period of not more than five years. The period of time during which the debarment will be imposed is to be determined by the chief procurement officer based upon the severity of the causes for debarment. After consultation with the using agency and city attorney, the chief procurement officer is authorized to suspend a person from participation in any city procurement at any tier and consideration for award of contracts if there is probable cause for debarment. The suspension shall not be for a period exceeding the greater of: (1) three months; (2) the period during which administrative review of the suspension is pending; or (3) the period during which judicial review of an administrative decision that was adverse to the suspended firm is pending.
(b)
Causes for debarment or suspension. The causes for debarment or suspension include:
(1)
Conviction for commission of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract or in the performance of such contract or subcontract.
(2)
Conviction under state and federal statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty which currently, seriously and directly affects responsibility as a city contractor.
(3)
Conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out of the solicitation and submission of bids or proposals.
(4)
Violation of contract provisions, as set forth below, of a character which is regarded by the chief procurement officer to be so serious as to justify debarment action:
a.
Deliberate failure to perform in accordance with the provisions or within the time limit provided in any city contract.
b.
A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts, provided that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment. In the event that the contractor asserts in a city suspension or debarment proceeding that such recent failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts was caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor, the contractor must introduce documentation from the applicable contract/project in which it provided notice of such acts beyond its control and/or invoked its rights to equitable adjustment or other similar remedies under the applicable contract as a result of force majeure or other similar events; provided, however, that the city's determination on such issue will be independent from the contract/project at issue. It is insufficient in a city debarment proceeding for the contractor to raise this issue for the first time concerning a prior contract under which it failed to perform or performed unsatisfactorily.
(5)
Violation of the ethical standards set forth in division 13 of this article.
(6)
Submission to the city of a claim for additional compensation that is without merit, including, but not limited to claims seeking to recoup:
a.
Costs incurred by the contractor but not included in its bid or proposal due to its own error;
b.
Costs that it has already been paid or will be paid under the contract;
c.
Costs asserted simply for the purpose of forcing the city to consider a settlement at a reduced amount;
d.
Costs that the contractor has not certified pursuant to the contract documents; and
e.
Costs that the contractor would not be entitled to recover under the contract documents, including, but not limited to attorneys fees and interest on unpaid sums.
(7)
Knowing misrepresentation to the city of the use which a majority-owned contractor intends to make of a minority and female business enterprise (a business entity at least 51 percent of which is owned and controlled by one or more African Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Hispanic Americans, or females, or a combination thereof, as defined in section 2-1443 and certified as such by the city), as a subcontractor, member of a mentor-protégé relationship, or a joint venture partner, in performing work under a contract with the city.
(8)
Material misrepresentation of the composition of the ownership or work force of a business entity certified to the city as a minority and female business enterprise.
(9)
Any other cause the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the using agency and city attorney, determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility, including, but not limited to, debarment by another governmental entity.
(c)
Notice. The chief procurement officer shall issue a written notice of the decision to debar or suspend. The notice shall state the reasons for the action taken and the effective date of the debarment or suspension and shall inform the debarred or suspended person involved of the right to administrative review as provided in this division.
(d)
Finality of decision. A decision under subsection (c) of this section is final and conclusive, unless fraudulent or any person adversely affected by the decision appeals administratively to the procurement appeals hearing officer in accordance with this division.
(e)
City council initiated debarment. The city's council, by enactment of an appropriate resolution, may request that the chief procurement officer initiate an investigation into whether a particular person should be debarred and/or suspended and, after consulting with the city attorney, the chief procurement officer is authorized to debar or suspend such person for cause from participation in any city procurements at any tier and consideration for award of contracts.

Sec. 2-1163. - Solicitations or awards in violation of law.
(a)
Applicability. This section applies where it is determined by administrative review that a solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of applicable law. For purposes of this section administrative review shall refer to a review by the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the city attorney, or a review by an appropriate procurement or office of contract compliance hearing officer. A determination by the chief procurement officer may be made independently and as a result of the chief procurement officer receiving a decision from an appeals officer that a solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of applicable law.
(b)
Remedies prior to award. If, prior to award, the chief procurement officer, after consultation with the city attorney, determines that a solicitation or proposed award of a contract is in violation of law, the solicitation or proposed award shall be canceled or revised to comply with the law.
(c)
Remedies after award. If, after an award, the chief procurement officer, after consultation with the city attorney, determines that a solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of applicable law, then:
(1)
If the person awarded the contract has not acted fraudulently or in bad faith:
a.
The contract may be ratified and affirmed, provided it is determined that doing so is in the best interest of the city; or
b.
If services or work have not commenced under the contract, it may be terminated and the person awarded the contract shall be compensated for the actual expenses reasonably incurred in preparing to perform and in terminating its performance under the contract, plus a reasonable profit, prior to the termination; or
c.
If services or work have commenced under the contract, it may be terminated and the person awarded the contract shall be compensated for the actual expenses reasonably incurred in preparing to perform and in terminating its performance under the contract, plus a reasonable profit, prior to the termination, less any amount previously paid to it under the contract.
(2)
If the person awarded the contract has acted fraudulently or in bad faith:
a.
The contract may be declared null and void; or
b.
The contract may be ratified and affirmed if such action is in the best interests of the city, without prejudice to the city's right to such damages as may be appropriate.
(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 3, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1164. - Procurement appeals hearing officers.

Appointment, qualifications and term. The Mayor shall appoint three procurement appeals hearing officers who shall be confirmed by the city council and who shall serve on an alternating basis. The officers shall possess the educational background and public or private employment experience to examine facts and apply legal principles, including, but not limited to experience with evidentiary and civil procedure issues, to controversies regarding the following subjects: procurement and disposal of goods and services, construction, professional and consultant services and information technology. No city employee or official shall be appointed who is a contractor or subcontractor or who owns any interest in any contracting or subcontracting firm or who does business with the city as a contractor. The officer shall serve a two-year term and shall not be eligible to serve more than two consecutive terms.
(b)
Duties and compensation. Each officer shall hold hearings upon appeal by any contractor, and the hearings shall be held in any municipal building and shall be open to the public.

(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 3, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1166. - Appeals.

Upon receipt of the notice of appeal from the aggrieved party by the chief procurement officer, the chief procurement officer shall forward the notice to a procurement appeals hearing officer within three days of receipt of the notice. The duties of the procurement appeals hearing officer shall be as follows:

The procurement appeals hearing officer shall set a hearing date not more than seven days from the date of receipt of the notice from the chief procurement officer. The officer shall cause notice of the hearing date, time and location to be served upon all parties, by registered mail.
(2)
At the hearing, all parties shall be provided a fair and impartial hearing and shall be allowed to produce any and all admissible evidence in either party's possession concerning the appeal.
(c)
Decision. The procurement appeals hearing officer shall, within seven days of the hearing, make a written decision on the appeal, which decision shall affirm or deny the decision by the chief procurement officer. The officer shall decide whether:
(1)
The solicitation or award being appealed was in accordance with applicable law and the terms and conditions of the solicitation; or
(2)
The debarment or suspension being appealed was in accordance with applicable law and in the best interest of the city and was fair.
(d)
Notice of decision. The procurement appeals hearing officer shall issue written notice of the decision on the appeal to all parties within seven days of the hearing. The notice of the decision shall be sent to all parties by registered mail and shall set forth the reasons for the decision.

Discontinuance of appeal. After a notice of appeal to the chief procurement officer has been filed, a protestor may not discontinue such appeal without prejudice, except as authorized by a procurement appeals hearing officer.
(g)
Recovery of costs by the city. If at the procurement appeals hearing, the city prevails, the procurement appeals hearing officer shall assess against the protestor reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred by the city in preparing for and attending the hearing. If the city is represented by its law department, for each attorney participating in the appeal, such fees and costs will be calculated at the hourly rate of pay as set forth in each attorney's most recent city paycheck multiplied by the number of hours worked by such participating attorneys on the appeal, plus all out of pocket costs of the city concerning the appeal, such as copying costs, transcription fees, litigation services fees, etc. If the city is represented by outside counsel at the hearing, such fees and costs will be calculated at the billing rates of the firm's attorneys participating in the appeal, times the number of hours worked by such participating attorneys, plus all out of pocket costs of the firm concerning the appeal. If the protestor appeals the decision of the procurement appeals hearing officer to the superior court, the city shall continue to hold the bond or certified check of the protester pending the results of the appeal to superior court. If the protester is unsuccessful in the superior court, the city shall deduct from the bond or certified check all of its costs associated with its review and response to the protest, its preparation for and attendance at the procurement appeals hearing and its response to, preparation for and attendance at any hearing held in superior court concerning protest and subsequent appeals. The city's costs in responding to, preparing for and attending any hearing in the superior court will be calculated in the same manner as its costs in preparing for and attending a procurement appeals hearing.
