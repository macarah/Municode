ii.
Shared parking. For the purposes of this NC district, a shared parking arrangement shall be defined as the use of a parking space by vehicles generated by two or more individual business establishments without conflict or encroachment. The director of the bureau of planning may grant an administrative variation (through a special administrative permit) to reduce parking requirements through a shared parking arrangement (whether on-site or off-site) subject to the following criteria:
1)
The arrangement shall avoid conflicting parking demands and provide for safe pedestrian circulation and access; and
2)
All shared parking spaces shall be clearly marked and signed reserved during specified hours which shall not be less than the hours of operation of the use.
iii.
An applicant seeking a special administrative permit for off-site parking or approval of a shared parking arrangement shall submit the following information:
1)
A to-scale map indicating location of the proposed parking spaces;
2)
Hours of business operation;
3)
Written consent from property owner of the proposed off-site parking area;
4)
Leases shall be provided to the bureau of buildings prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Lapse of a required lease shall render the business out of compliance with the parking regulations.
iv.
Reduction in parking. Reductions in parking requirements, except as noted in subsection (ii) above for shared parking arrangements, shall require a special exception by the board of zoning adjustments.
b.
Eating and drinking establishments.
i.
Off-site parking. At any time when 14 eating and drinking establishments are legally permitted to operate within the district, no additional eating and drinking establishment shall be granted an administrative variation to allow for off-site parking but shall seek such relief from the board of zoning adjustment by special exception. As of the effective date of this chapter, the director of the bureau of planning (the "director") shall create and maintain a census of the total number of eating and drinking establishments operating in the district. The census shall be verified to confirm the actual number of eating and drinking establishments in operation in the district within 15 days of the date that an application for a variation to allow for off-site parking for an eating and drinking establishment is received by the director to determine whether an application to the board of zoning adjustment is required.
ii.
Shared parking. Parking facilities containing the required parking for any eating and drinking establishment shall not provide less than the total of the minimum number of parking spaces that are required for each individual eating and drinking establishment which claims that the parking facility is being used to meet its parking requirement. No individual use meeting its required parking within a facility that serves multiple uses may claim any space that is being utilized by another use unless those spaces are the subject of a shared parking arrangement as permitted in subsection (iii) below.
iii.
Reduction of parking. Eating and drinking establishments shall not be granted an administrative variation to reduce the required parking or utilize shared parking but may seek this relief by application to the board of zoning adjustment for a special exception. All other uses seeking to reduce their parking through a shared parking arrangement shall comply with subsection 8(a) above.
iv.
Parking signage. Parking facilities providing parking to serve multiple business establishments (whether on-site or off-site) shall include signage that identifies all said business establishments. Such signage shall be visible near the entrance(s) of said parking facility.
