(Code 1977, § 16-18F.002)
Sec. 16-18F.003. - Organization.
The regulations are composed of two (2) parts. The first part includes those regulations which apply to the entire SPI-6 district. The second part includes specific regulations which are unique to each of the subareas. The map entitled, "Poncey-Highland Housing Plan" (hereinafter referred to as PHHP), prepared by the City of Atlanta Bureau of Planning dated July 17, 1987, shall be made a part of these regulations for purposes of delineating the subareas.
The SPI-6 Poncey-Highland District is divided into subareas as follows:
(1)
Subarea 1: All new development in this subarea shall be accomplished in accordance with all of the regulations and restrictions of RG zoning for single- and two-family dwellings except as specified in the general regulations for SPI-6 [section 16-18F.004] and the specific regulations for Subarea 1.
(2)
Subarea 2: All new development in this subarea shall be accomplished in accordance with all of the regulations and restrictions of RG-2 zoning and a maximum floor area ratio of 0.348 except as specified in the general regulations for SPI-6 [section 16-18F.004] and specific regulations for Subarea 2.
(3)
Subarea 3: All new development in this subarea shall be accomplished in accordance with all of the regulations and restrictions of RG-2 zoning and a maximum floor area ratio of 0.348, except as specified in the general regulations for SPI-6 [section 16-18F.004] and the specified regulations for Subarea 3.
(4)

(Code 1977, § 16-18F.003)
Sec. 16-18F.004. - General regulations.
The following regulations shall apply to the entire Poncey-Highland SPI-6 District, which includes all subareas. All proposed development shall require preliminary design review by the Atlanta Urban Design Commission (AUDC). Plans submitted for review shall include a site plan at a minimum scale of 1″ = 20′, typical building sections, exterior elevations at a minimum scale of ¼″ = 1′-0″, and outline specifications covering all exterior building and landscaping materials. All final construction documents submitted in application for a building permit shall require a certificate of appropriateness from the AUDC as provided for in sections 16-20.007 and 16-20.008 of this part. All proposed development shall conform to the following regulations; and AUDC shall have the power to hear, grant or deny variances from the terms of these regulations.
(1)
Regulations shall be established for all subareas. Regulations as stated herein shall be minimum standards which must be followed and shall be applied by the AUDC.
(2)
The compatibility rule: In order to assure that these regulations allow flexibility and accommodate innovative design solutions, many regulations shall be made subject to the compatibility rule, which states that the element in question (site design, architectural scale and exterior architectural elements) shall be similar in character to that which is prevalent for like uses in the immediate area. The compatibility rule is the discretionary device to allow architectural and site design compatibility, and other special design considerations to be assessed by AUDC. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide substantiation of various design elements in adjacent, existing residential buildings.
(3)
The subdivision of land within the SPI-6 district shall be subject to administrative approval provided for in the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Atlanta. Applications for administrative approval shall not be filed until after required preliminary review by AUDC has occurred. Subdivision of land or combination of lots shall be to the maximum extent feasible, compatible with existing siting characteristics in areas adjoining the SPI-6 district.
(4)
Off-street parking:
a.
Off-street parking shall not be permitted in the front yard of a lot used for residential purposes.
b.
Off-street parking shall be permitted in the rear or side yard of a lot used for residential purposes.
c.
Carports or garages shall be permitted if detached from and located to the rear of the main residential structure. If the structure is located on a corner lot, the front yard setback for that side street shall apply to the construction of a carport or garage. Carports and garages should also be permitted if they are part of the main structure and conform to similar existing structures of the older homes.
d.
Off-street parking shall not be permitted on vacant lots, except that one adjacent lot owned by the resident occupant may be used to park up to two owners' vehicles in operable condition provided such parking does not fall within the established front, side or rear yard setback and such parking is screened from street view by landscaping or fencing as approved by AUDC.
e.
Off-site parking is prohibited.
f.
Off-street parking of personal travel trailers, motor homes and trucks in excess of three-quarter ton shall not be permitted overnight.
(5)
Accessory structures: The design of all accessory structures as defined by this part shall be subject to design review by AUDC.
(6)
Electric vehicle charging stations equipped with Level 1 and/or Level 2 EVSE are permitted as an accessory structure and shall be subject to design review by AUDC.
(7)
Site design:
a.
It is not the intent of the SPI-6 district regulations to limit new development to single-family lots matching prior subdivision lines. However, where single-family lots are combined for higher residential development, i.e., condominium development, the siting of all multi-family and single-family structures shall retain the appearance of individual lots with front building façades parallel to street rights-of-way or perpendicular to side lot lines where possible, and with building spacings subject to the compatibility rule and design review by AUDC.
b.
All buildings shall conform to traditional housing characteristics by having a sidewalk, front walk, front yard, front porch, and front doors facing the street.
c.
Driveways extending to parking areas in the side or rear yard shall be a maximum of 10 feet wide where passing through the front yard.
d.
Landscaped areas in front of each residential building shall be designed to reinforce the appearance of individual ownership.
e.
An appropriate buffer of natural material fences or walls shall be provided between multi-family units and existing residential dwellings. Chain link fences are not allowable. Every effort shall be taken to preserve existing trees.
f.
All sidewalks shall be installed to provide a six-foot minimum planting strip between the sidewalk and curb. A minimum of two (2) trees shall be planted for each 50 feet of street frontage. The minimum size of trees shall be two-inch caliper. They shall be planted and maintained by the adjoining property owner(s) in the planting strip. Alternate tree planting plans may be submitted subject to design review.
g.
Retaining walls and fences of like design shall not be continuously built across more than one front yard and shall be subject to design review by AUDC.
h.
Every tree which is removed shall be measured for total caliper. It shall be replaced with trees which, in aggregate, total the same caliper as the tree removed.
i.
Every effort shall be made to preserve existing trees. Before any site preparation work shall begin, a plan shall be submitted to AUDC and to the city arborist to include:
1.
Location of all existing trees with type and caliper indicated;
2.
All existing trees to be saved indicated; and
3.
All proposed trees located with type and caliper indicated.
j.
All trees which are not in good health within three (3) years of installation shall be replaced by the owner.
k.
All services, including gas, water, electricity, telephone, furnaces, air conditioning units, etc., shall not be located on the front of or in the front yards of the main building, nor on the street side yard of the corner lot.
(8)
Building façade:
a.
The proportions of the façade, general façade organization and form shall be subject to design review by AUDC.
b.
Exterior doors visible to the street shall be wood panel or fixed glass panel in wood frame; metal doors and cross-buck type doors are prohibited.

Resawn cedar shingles shall be subject to the compatibility rule and shall in no case exceed 50 percent of any building façade. Rusticated materials, such as stone, textured stucco, split cedar shakes, vertical siding, etc., shall be subject to the compatibility rule and shall in no case exceed 20 percent of any building façade visible from the street. Concrete block, asbestos shingles, vinyl shingles and aluminum shingles and synthetic stucco-like materials are prohibited.
d.
Slab on grade construction is prohibited. All buildings shall be elevated on foundation walls which shall be of a material that contrasts with the primary façade siding material. Height and materials are subject to design review by AUDC.
e.
Exterior trim shall be of wood regardless of the primary siding material; aluminum or vinyl is prohibited. The compatibility rule applies to both the type and dimension of trim, including corner boards, fascia, barge and rakes, bottom boards, window and door trim and other like trim.
f.
Windows shall be double-hung or casement types. Individual windows shall have proportions emphasizing the vertical. Minimum window height for building elevations visible from the street is five (5) feet. Sliding glass doors, unfinished metal windows, picture windows and prefabricated bay windows are prohibited where they are visible from the street.
