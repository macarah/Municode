CHAPTER 20V. - PONCEY-HIGHLAND HISTORIC DISTRICT

Sec. 16-20V.001. - Title and purpose.
The general intent of the regulations for the Poncey-Highland Historic District ("the district") is:
(1)
To preserve the overall architectural history and character of the residential buildings that were constructed in the district during the 1905—1940 development period and non-residential buildings in the 1914—1955 time period, and to ensure that additions, alterations, and renovations to those buildings are consistent with the historic character of the individual structure or that additions are clearly contemporary in style;
(2)
To preserve the district's historic development patterns characterized primarily by single-family houses, duplexes, multifamily buildings, small-scale and medium-scaled commercial buildings, and scattered industrial buildings;
(3)
To retain the predominant historic and existing residential architectural forms and styles of the district, including Bungalow, Duplex, American Small House, American Foursquare, Single Building Apartment, and Garden/Courtyard Apartment forms; and Craftsman, Neoclassical Revival, Colonial Revival, Mediterranean Revival, and Italian Renaissance Revival styles;
(4)
To retain the predominant historic and exiting commercial and industrial architectural forms and styles of the district, including pre-World War II, three-part storefront buildings and pre- and post-World War II masonry, large-windowed manufacturing, warehousing, and industrial buildings;
(5)
To preserve the historic and existing physical site planning patterns of the district, including spatial relationships between buildings, and between buildings and the public street that reflect the historic pedestrian and non-automobile movement in the district; and to allow for alterations and additions to properties that reinforce the historic and existing features and site planning patterns;
(6)
To prevent the subdivision or aggregation of existing lots in any manner that would disrupt the historic platting pattern, lot sizes, and spatial relationships established during the 1905-1940 residential development period and the 1914-1955 non-residential development period, or otherwise detract from the identified historic qualities of the district;
(7)
To encourage neighborhood revitalization, compatible commercial and multi-family development and prevention of displacement of residents and long-standing businesses;
(8)
To ensure all new construction observes, and is compatible with, the general setbacks, height, scale and massing of the original and historic development and site planning patterns;
(9)
To ensure the construction of new principal structures in residential subareas is either compatible with the historic and existing architectural character of the district and is internally consistent to the identified predominant architectural forms and styles; or is of an architectural style that is internally consistent and clearly non-historic contextual in style;
(10)
To retain the existing overall commercial and non-residential land use patterns, discourage encroachment of the commercial areas into residential subareas, to allow the conversion of non-residential buildings forms into residential use and maintain the small-scale and diversity of the commercial uses historically found along the district's significant transportation corridors; and
(11)
To preserve and enhance the historic and architectural appearance of the district to substantially promote the public health, safety and general welfare.
The district is further divided into seven subareas with the following additional purposes for each subarea:
(12)
Residential Core, Subarea 1. To preserve the subarea's low-rise character of small-scale detached, residential buildings, site features, and uses compatible with that form, and retain the existing contributing buildings.
(13)
Beltline Residential, Subarea 2. To encourage the redevelopment of the area to a mix of low-rise residential uses with a variety of architectural styles to serve as a transition between more intense mixed-use development along the BeltLine, less intensive residential Subarea 6 to the north, and Freedom Park to the east, per the Poncey-Highland Neighborhood Master Plan and Atlanta BeltLine Subarea 5 Master Plan; and to allow the demolition of historic buildings due to the limited intact historic fabric in the subarea.
(14)
North Highland Mixed-Use, Subarea 3. To retain the subarea's pedestrian scale and character, ensure that new development reinforces the subarea's pedestrian scale and character, retain the existing contributing buildings, reinforce its role as a mixed-use, neighborhood-oriented commercial center, and expand housing options.
(15)
Ponce de Leon Mixed-Use, Subarea 4. To encourage a mix of residential and non-residential uses that balance Ponce de Leon Avenue's role as an arterial corridor with its close proximity to residential areas, and to retain the existing contributing buildings.
(16)
BeltLine Mixed-Use, Subarea 5. To encourage intense mixed-use development along the Atlanta BeltLine that supports existing City of Atlanta plans, including, but not limited to, the BeltLine Redevelopment Plan and the Atlanta BeltLine Subarea 5 Master Plan, and to incorporate the existing contributing buildings into new development.
(17)
Bonaventure-Somerset Residential, Subarea 6. To preserve the subarea's low-rise character of small-scale, detached residential buildings, site features, and uses compatible with that form, and to retain existing contributing buildings.
(18)
Freedom Park Transitional, Subarea 7. To preserve Freedom Park's exclusive continued use as open space.

The following apply to all properties in the district.
(1)
Certificates of appropriateness. A City of Atlanta application/permit used to review and approve design, development and construction activities on properties or districts designated as Historic and Landmark by the City of Atlanta.
(a)
Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance (as defined in section 16-20V.004(18)) are not required. A certificate of appropriateness is not required if a building permit is not required for such work. Painting or repainting of any structure or portion thereof does not require a certificate of appropriateness but must comply with section 16-20V.006(1)(e) or section 16-20V.009(1)(e) about painting of unpainted masonry surfaces.
(b)
Type II certificates of appropriateness are required from the director of the urban design commission ("the director") for the following activities, except for those activities noted in section 16-20V.005(1)(a) above:
(i)
All exterior alterations to existing structures within the lot compatibility zone;
(ii)
Dormer additions and gable additions that are no higher than the ridgeline of the principal structure and at least maintain the setbacks of the principal structure;
(iii)
Roof plane extensions that at least maintain the side yard setbacks of the principal structure;
(iv)
Rear additions which are no higher than the highest ridgeline of the principal structure and at least maintain the side yard setbacks of the principal structure;
(v)
New accessory structures;
(vi)
Fences, walls, and retaining walls in yards adjacent to a District right-of-way;
(vii)
Decks, walkways, driveways, and other paving;

Notwithstanding section 16-28A.007(v) of the Zoning Ordinance, Type II certificates of appropriateness for new signage or alterations to existing signage shall be reviewed and approved by the director.
If the proposed activity meets the applicable district regulations, the director must issue a Type II certificate within 14 days of the receipt of a complete application. If the proposed activity does not meet the applicable district regulations, the director must deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of the application. Appeals from a decision of the director about a Type II certificate of appropriateness by any aggrieved person will be processed as prescribed in the appeals portion of section 20.008(a) of the Zoning Ordinance.
(c)
Type III certificates of appropriateness are required from the urban design commission ("commission") for the following activities, except for those activities noted in section 16-20V.005(1)(a) and (b) above:
(i)
All new principal structures;
(ii)
Additions to the side of a principal structure, second story additions, and all other additions, except those noted in section 16-20V.005(1)(b);

Revisions to previously approved plans that result in an increase in the floor area ratio, lot coverage, or height; or an expansion of the building footprint; and
(iv)
Variances and special exceptions.
(d)
Type IV certificates of appropriateness are required from the urban design commission only for the demolition or moving of any historic/contributing principal building. However, a partial demolition of a historic/contributing principal building also requires a Type IV certificate of appropriateness when the partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the building's historic interpretability or importance to the district. Pursuant to section 16-20V.001(13), demolition or partial demolition of a historic/contributing principal building in Subarea 2 does not require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness.
(2)
Variances and special exceptions.
(a)
Variances and special exceptions must be heard by the commission. The commission has the authority to grant or deny variances or special exceptions from the provisions of the district when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, and criteria for decisions regarding such variances and special exceptions must be as specified in chapter 26 of the Zoning Ordinance.
(b)
Zoning variances granted prior to enactment of this district. Any property owner who obtained a variance from the board of zoning appeal on or after January 1, 1982, and before the effective date of this district, to construct all, or a portion, of a project in the district, is entitled to construct said project according to the plans presented in that application.
(3)
Financial hardship exemptions.
(a)
These regulations establish a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of neighborhood revitalization and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the grounds of economic hardship to the property owner.
(b)
The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence is on the applicant.
(c)
The commission must consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
(i)
The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
(ii)
The age of the property owner;
(iii)
The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought;
(iv)
The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
(v)
The costs associated with adherence to these regulations;
(vi)
The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and
(vii)
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
(d)
The Commission must consider these factors. If it finds that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations it must grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate.
(4)
Subdivisions, consolidations, and replatting of lots.
(a)
Subareas 1, 2, 6. The platting pattern of lots is an integral part of the historic character of these subareas. No subdivision, consolidation, or replat may be approved by the City of Atlanta unless it can be shown through archival documentation or maps that the proposal is substantially consistent with the original platting pattern of the subarea. In addition to the regulations of the City of Atlanta Subdivision and Zoning Ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions, consolidations and replats of lots must conform to the original platting pattern in the subarea with regard to the area of the lot, dimensions, and configurations, except in Subarea 6, where contributing multifamily properties containing four or more units may be consolidated with other immediately adjacent contributing multifamily properties containing four or more units.
(b)
Subareas 3, 4, 5, 7.
(i)
Subdivision. No subdivision of lots may be approved unless it can be shown that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the particular subarea or of the District as a whole, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots.
(ii)
Consolidation and replatting of lots. No consolidation of lots or replatting of lots may be approved unless it can be shown that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the subarea, and the District as a whole, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots.
(5)
The Compatibility Rule. To permit flexibility and to ensure alterations and additions to existing structures and the design of new structures are sensitive to and sympathetic toward the existing character of the district, some regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The elements in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match the predominant original or historic elements of the historic/contributing buildings of like use on the same block, including the subject property if historic/contributing. If there is not a predominant original or historic element on the same block, the element in question shall be consistent with the architectural style of the structure. Where quantifiable, the element in question (i.e., building height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the historic/contributing buildings of like use on the same block, including the subject property if historic/contributing." Those elements that the compatibility rule applies to are specified in the District regulations by reference to "compatibility rule."
(6)
Rebuilding of detached house, stacked flat, townhouse, and carriage house building types. After a partial or complete destruction of an entire structure or any portions of a detached house, stacked flat, townhouse, or carriage house building type due to fire, tree fall damage, or other un-intentional causes, for the purposes of zoning compliance, the previously existing structure or portion of structure may be rebuilt to its previously existing exterior condition in all respects, including but not limited to height, setbacks, location, lot coverage, building components, architectural elements, and general design. If the structure or portions of a structure are not rebuilt to their previously existing exterior condition, all aspects of the new structure or new portions of an existing structure must meet the District regulations and all other applicable Zoning Ordinance regulations.
(7)
Height calculation. The height of structures is measured as follows:
(a)
In Subareas 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, the height of structures is measured on the front facade from the average point of grade along said front facade to the highest point of the roof or façade, whichever is higher.
(b)
In Subarea 5, the height of structures with one or more facades adjacent to the BeltLine corridor is measured on the BeltLine corridor-facing façade from the average point of grade along said facade to the highest point of the roof or façade, whichever is higher. The height of structures with no facades adjacent to the BeltLine corridor is measured as indicated in section 16-20V.005(7)(a) above.
(8)
Default review standards. The commission shall apply the following standards when the standards set forth elsewhere in this District do not specifically address the proposed work including but not limited to work proposed for the following building types: stacked flats, commercial blocks, shopfronts, towers, or civic buildings.
(a)
A property must be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive design and appearance, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
(b)
The historic character of a property must be retained and preserved. The or alteration of the design, appearance, features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property must be avoided.
(c)
Each property must be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes must not be undertaken that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties.
(d)
Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right must be retained and preserved.
(e)
Distinctive designs, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, must be preserved.
(f)
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature must match the old in design, texture, appearance, and, where possible, materials.
(g)
Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, must be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials may not be used.
(h)
Archaeological resources must be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures must be undertaken.
(i)
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction may not destroy historic features and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old and must be compatible with the historic features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
(j)
New additions and adjacent or related new construction must be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(9)
Contributing buildings status.
(a)
All contributing buildings within the district are shown on the map adopted herewith entitled "Poncey-Highland Historic District." Said map identifies each building in the district that meets the definition of "contributing building, structure or site" set forth in section 16-20.002 and further defined as a "Historic/Contributing Property" in section 16-20V.004.
(b)
The director must periodically review said map to correct errors or omissions to said map, or to reflect any changed conditions relevant to the contributing status of buildings within the district, consistent with the requirements of chapter 20V and chapter 20 of the Zoning Ordinance, and must maintain public records of said list and all such errors, omissions or updates. An action by the director to correct such errors or omissions, or to make updates, must be initiated by execution of a signed and dated form promulgated by the director specifying the action initiated, the reason(s) for such action, and the identification of all property subject to said action. Said form must be mailed by first class mail to the owner(s) of the effected property within five calendar days of the initiation of the action by the director.
(c)
An action by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, the map as authorized in section 16-20V.005(9)(b) above will result in the immediate prohibition of any new or amended applications of any kind effecting such property, including but not limited to demolition requests, building permits or land disturbance permits, and including acceptance of any such application or request by any City of Atlanta bureau, agency, official, employee or agent. Said prohibitions will become automatically effective without further action of any kind immediately upon the date and time that the director takes an action authorized in section 16-20V.005(9)(b) above. The purpose and intent of this provision is to maintain the status quo regarding any such effected property until the director's action is reviewed and affirmed or reversed by the commission in the manner specified in section 16-20V.005(9)(d) below. The period of this mandatory interim protection will be 90 days or until a final decision reviewing such action is made by the Commission, whichever first occurs, commencing on the date and time of the director's decision. This interim control period allows and is based upon approximately 30 days for the initial scheduling of the public hearing following the director's action and approximately 60 days for completion of the public hearing and a final decision by the commission.
(d)
All actions by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, said map shall be reviewed and approved by the commission using the notice and procedures required for Type III certificates of appropriateness with the following modifications:
(i)
Hearings on such review and approval by the commission must be scheduled by the director within 30 days of the director's action on such correction(s) or update(s) and must be decided by the commission within a reasonable time; and
(ii)
The commission will affirm the action(s) of the director upon an expressed finding by the commission that the director's action(s) correctly applied the definitions and requirements for determining the contributing status of the properties in question in chapter 20V and chapter 20 of part 16.
In exercising its review, the commission may reverse or affirm the action(s) of the director, wholly or partly. Appeals from a decision by the commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to section 16-20.010.
(10)
Affordable workforce housing for beltline zoning overlay district. Chapter 36A of this part shall remain in full force and effect for the properties located in the district which were otherwise subject to chapter 36A prior to the adoption of the district.
