(3)
To accommodate residential and non-residential growth without the losing land zoned for industrial uses in the process.
(4)
To promote the growth of both large and small businesses.
(5)
To ensure that industrial and non-industrial uses in the same development are compatible and planned in a unified manner.
(6)
To ensure that development in this district is compatible with adjacent districts in terms of operation, scale, and design.
(7)
To promote development patterns that encourage walking, bicycling, and transit use.

Sec. 16-16A.003. - Procedures.
(1)
Rezoning pre-application:
(a)
In addition to the current rezoning procedures, any applications for rezoning to this district shall begin with a pre-application consultation between the applicant and the director of the office of zoning and development.
(b)
At the required pre-application meeting applicants shall submit materials necessary to establish conformance with the concurrency requirements of section 16-16A.008(1). These may include, but are not limited to, a site plan showing:
i.
Building footprint, heights, and areas dedicated to required industrial uses;
ii.
Total floor area of industrial and non-industrial uses and floor area ratios; and
iii.
Other items deemed necessary by the director of the office of zoning and development to establish conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
(2)
Special administrative permit requirements:
(a)
A special administrative permit (SAP) application shall be submitted and approved by the director of the office of zoning and development, under the requirements specified in section 16-25.004, prior to the issuance of a building permit. The application shall include:
i.
The specified number of copies of a "Master Plan Document," which shall include: a conceptual site plan; total floor area and location of industrial uses, other non-residential uses, and residential units; open space required and provided; parking; and phasing. The director shall review the "Master Plan Document" for conformance with section 16-16A.002 Statement of Intent, section 16-16A.003 Procedures, and other requirements of this chapter.
ii.
The specified number of copies of each site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted as applicable, and all exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), expansions of outdoor dining or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that alters the configuration of openings, shall subject said site plan and building elevation approval as part of the SAP. Any interior renovations or other exterior repair that result in no modifications shall not require SAP approval.
(b)
Any changes to an approved "Master Plan Document" shall be processed and reviewed as an amendment to the original SAP.
(c)
Where regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the SAP for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for a special exception or special use permit.
(3)
Provisions for administrative variations from regulations:
(a)
As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the director of the office of zoning and development may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either:
i.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or
ii.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future.
(b)
Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record. Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to a public street), minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum parking and loading requirements, and signage limitations.
