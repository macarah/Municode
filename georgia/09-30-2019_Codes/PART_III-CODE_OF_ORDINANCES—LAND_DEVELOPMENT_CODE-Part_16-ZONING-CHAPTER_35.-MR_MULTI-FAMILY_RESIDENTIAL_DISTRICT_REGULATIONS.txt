CHAPTER 35. - MR MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-35.001. - Authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City of Atlanta's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to the Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 3 and Article 9 Section 2, Paragraph 4, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, §§ 3-061 through 3-603, and Charter Appendix IV, §§ 41, 42, 45, 48 and 70, as well as the general police powers of the City of Atlanta and such other authority as may be provided by applicable, state, federal and local laws.
The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are regulations which are applicable in those parts of the city designated as Multi-family Residential (MR) district. The passage of an ordinance approving the classification of an area of the city for multi-family residential zoning shall supplant the zoning classifications applicable to the area so designated. Whenever the following regulations are at variance with said existing historic protection regulations, the historic protection regulations shall apply. Whenever the following regulations conflict with provisions of Part 16 other than historic protection regulations, the more stringent regulation shall apply.
(Ord. No. 2002-39, § 1, 5-28-02)
Sec. 16-35.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.
The City of Atlanta finds that the size, scale and character of multi-family residential uses directly affects adjacent land uses and the public health, safety and welfare. The city finds that internally focused, highway-oriented multi-family residential uses are incompatible with establishing a pedestrian infrastructure and are inconsistent with the needs of the city. The city finds there is a need to protect existing and developing pedestrian-oriented multi-family residential areas and building forms from the intrusion of incompatible building forms and to preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic multi-family residential districts, as well as create new pedestrian oriented multi-family residential areas. The city finds that within these residential areas there is a substantial need to encourage a balanced mix of uses to include small accessory retail uses and to facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation. The city finds that it is necessary to improve air quality by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips. The city finds that it is necessary to establish adequate parking requirements by encouraging shared parking arrangements. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter, in establishing the Multi-family Residential (MR) district, is as follows:
1.
Create a diversified city where people across the spectrum of age, income, ethnicity, and culture can live, work, shop, meet, and play;
2.
Provide for multi-family residential housing types that are compatible with single-family neighborhoods and commercial nodes;
3.
Encourage the development of multi-family housing, with limited neighborhood serving commercial uses;
4.
Encourage a range of housing types and prices to meet different housing needs;
5.
Improve the aesthetics of the built environment;
6.
Protect existing stable single-family neighborhoods from uses and building forms which are incompatible with their scale, character and needs;
7.
Ensure pedestrian-oriented building forms;
8.
Provide for a pedestrian-oriented environment on streets and sidewalks;
9.
Promote public safety through the provision of pedestrian-oriented street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, adequate visibility from adjacent buildings and primary pedestrian access from buildings to adjacent sidewalks;
10.
Reserve the space between the building and the sidewalk for pedestrian related uses;
11.
Provide appropriately-scaled, continuous pedestrian oriented uses and activities adjacent to sidewalks along streets with identified pedestrian needs;
12.
Encourage a grid of connected streets to improve access and reduce congestion;
13.
Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and vehicles;
14.
Facilitate safe and convenient bicycle usage;
15.
Provide sufficient parking in an unobtrusive manner;
16.
Maximize opportunities for pedestrian amenities, including parks, plazas, greenways and public art;
17.
Provide sufficient, safe and accessible parks, plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment; and
18.
Improve the quality of air and water through provisions for the planting of trees, greenspace protection, bicycle parking and electric vehicle parking.

(Ord. No. 2002-39, § 1, 5-28-02; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 6.A, 1-31-19 )
Sec. 16-35.004. - Special administrative permit requirement for building permits—Effect on other special permit requirements.
Except as provided below, no building permit in any multi-family residential district shall be issued unless and until it has been approved through the issuance of a special administrative permit (SAP) under the requirements so specified in section 16-25.004, as meeting applicable requirements and intent as set forth for the district involved. A SAP application and seven copies each of a site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning prior to the issuance of a building permit, with an eighth copy to be mailed concurrently to the appropriate NPU chair or his/her designee for information purposes.
Where regulations may require the approval of a special administrative permit for other purposes so specified, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall, without additional application, include consideration of other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for special exception or special use permit.
(Ord. No. 2002-39, § 1, 5-28-02)
Sec. 16-35.004A. - Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.
As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, the director of the bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either:
1.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or
2.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future.
Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record. Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to the street), minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum or maximum (as applicable) parking and loading requirements, and signage limitations.
