Aircraft landing weights are gross weights as defined in section 22-56.
(b)
The amount of the nonsignatory landing fee shall consist of a basic landing fee of $0.19 and an airfield improvements landing fee of $0.63 for a total landing fee of not less than $1.52 per 1,000 pounds based on the maximum certificated gross landing weight of the aircraft.

Unless prior credit arrangements are established with the aviation general manager or host lessee, all landing fees and all other charges shall be payable to the city or host lessee prior to the departure of the aircraft concerned.

The aviation general manager shall determine what procedures and forms shall be used for billing purposes.

(e)
If the operator of any aircraft required by this section to pay landing fees shall fail or refuse to do so, the aviation general manager is authorized to serve such operator or the owner of the aircraft with a notice that the city claims a lien upon the aircraft or any other aircraft of the owner or operator for the landing fees.
