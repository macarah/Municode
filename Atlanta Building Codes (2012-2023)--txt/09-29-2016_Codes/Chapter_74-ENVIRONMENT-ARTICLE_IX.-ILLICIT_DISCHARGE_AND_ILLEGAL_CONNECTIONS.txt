ARTICLE IX. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 74-426. - Statement of findings.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the storm sewer system of the City of Atlanta that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
(2)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the storm sewer system of the City of Atlanta from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
(3)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the storm sewer system of the city;
(6)
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the storm sewer system of the city;
(7)
Therefore, the City of Atlanta must adopt this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the storm sewer system of the City of Atlanta. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the storm sewer system of the city is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
