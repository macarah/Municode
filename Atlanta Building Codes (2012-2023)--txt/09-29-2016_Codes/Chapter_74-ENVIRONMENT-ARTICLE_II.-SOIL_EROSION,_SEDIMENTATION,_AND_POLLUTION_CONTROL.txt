ARTICLE II. - SOIL EROSION, SEDIMENTATION, AND POLLUTION CONTROL[2]

Sec. 74-36. - Title, authority and findings.
(a)
Title. This article will be known as the "City of Atlanta Soil Erosion, Sedimentation, and Pollution Control Ordinance."
(b)
Authority. This article is enacted to implement the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1, et seq., as amended in the 2009 Session of the Georgia General Assembly.
(c)
Findings. The Council of the City of Atlanta finds that soil erosion and sediment deposition onto lands and into waters within the watersheds of the city are occurring as a result of a need for improvement in the application of proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities and that such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of state waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational., fish and wildlife, and other resources uses. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the city and the intent of this article to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sedimentation control activities and programs of the city and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a city-wide comprehensive soil erosion and sedimentation control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air and other resources of the city. The city further declares its intention through this article to meet or exceed, where permitted, the requirements of state and federal law regarding the regulation of land-disturbing activities.
