Because of the need to use written tests which have been professionally developed and validated in accordance with both professional standards and legal guidelines, all sworn members reviewing test papers are expressly forbidden from taking any test material, review material or any written notes from the review room. To the extent practicable, reference material used in developing the written test will be made available to members during the review period.

(d)
Prior to the completion of the 12-month probationary period, the chief of the department shall decide whether or not the probationary employee will receive status in the higher rank.

(e)
At any time during the probationary period, the chief of the applicable department may remove a promoted sworn member whose performance does not meet the required work standards and return that member to the rank in which the member has retained status. In such event, the chief of the department shall notify the member in writing that the probationary evaluation part of the examination has been failed and the reason for such failure. Such notification shall be given at least 15 days in advance of the date the action is to be official and not later than 15 days before the 12-month probationary period is to expire.
