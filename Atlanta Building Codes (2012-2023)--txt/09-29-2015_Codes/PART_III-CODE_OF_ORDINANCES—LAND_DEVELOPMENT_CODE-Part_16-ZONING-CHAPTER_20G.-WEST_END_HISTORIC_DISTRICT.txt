Sec. 16-20G.003. - Boundaries.
The boundaries for the West End Historic District constitute an overlay Historic District (HD) zoning district, which district shall be reflected in the official zoning maps of the City of Atlanta for convenience in referencing, the district is denoted into two subareas, Subarea I, lying to the north of Ralph David Abernathy, Jr. Boulevard, and Subarea II, lying to the south of said street.

(Code 1977, § 16-20G.004; Ord. No. 2011-45(11-O-0778), § 1, 10-12-11)
Sec. 16-20G.005. - General regulations.
The following general regulations shall apply to the West End Historic District.
(1)
Certificates of Appropriateness: Certificates of appropriateness within this district shall be required as follows:
(a)
When required:
(i)
To change the exterior appearance of any portion of a structure within the district, when said change can be seen from the public right-of-way;
(ii)
To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any structure within the district, when said addition can be seen from public right-of-way; and

(b)
Type required:
(i)
Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Code of Ordinances.
(ii)
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit.
(iii)
Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance are not required in this district. This exemption in no way obviates the requirements for certificates of appropriateness set forth in this section.
(iv)
The following Type II Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the director of the commission and shall be required for any of the following:
(a)
fences, walls, retaining walls;
(b)
decks, skylights, solar panels, mechanical and communication equipment if visible from a public street;
(c)
new accessory structures and alterations to existing accessory structures;
(d)
shutters, awnings if visible from a public street;
(e)
replacement of non-original, non-historic or missing elements that otherwise meet the regulations, including but not limited to siding, windows, porch railings, porch columns, porch flooring, exterior doors if visible from a public street, and
(f)
paving.
If a Type II Certificate of Appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director of the commission shall issue the Type II Certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If a Type II Certificate of Appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II Certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I Certificates.
(v)
The following Type II Certificates of Appropriateness shall be review by the commission and shall be required for any of the following to the extent they are visible from a public street:
a.
Alterations to any façade of any principal structure; and
b.
All site work, except as noted in Section 16-20G.005(b)(4).

c.
Subdivisions and aggregations.
d.
Variances.
(vii)
Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance.
(2)
The Compatibility Rule: The compatibility rule is a method of ensuring that alterations to existing structures and the design of proposed new construction are sensitive to and sympathetic toward existing elements of design, proportions, scale, massing, materials, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The elements in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same block face, or where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same block face." Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule."
(3)
Variances: The urban design commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances from the provisions of this chapter (20G) when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this part 46, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein.
(4)
Financial Hardship Exemptions:
(a)
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner.
(b)
In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes.
(c)
If the urban design commission finds that the requirement of subsection (ii) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with the following factors, standards and criteria:
(i)
The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner.
(ii)
The urban design commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
a.
The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
b.
The availability, at present or in the future, or other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
c.
The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations;
d.
The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and
e.
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
(iii)
The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations.
(5)
Lot size: In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, the compatibility rule specified in this chapter 20G shall apply to all subdivisions and aggregations of lots with regard to lot size, dimensions and configurations.
