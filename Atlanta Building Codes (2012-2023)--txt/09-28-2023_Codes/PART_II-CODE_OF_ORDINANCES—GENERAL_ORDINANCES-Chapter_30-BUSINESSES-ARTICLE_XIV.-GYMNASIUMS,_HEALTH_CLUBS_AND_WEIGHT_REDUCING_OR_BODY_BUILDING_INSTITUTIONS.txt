ARTICLE XIV. - GYMNASIUMS, HEALTH CLUBS AND WEIGHT REDUCING OR BODY BUILDING INSTITUTIONS

Sec. 30-841. - Business license required
Every gymnasium, health club, aerobics club or slimnastics club owner/operator must first obtain a license before transacting new business or continuing to transact ongoing business.
Upon completion of the application, the licenses & permits unit shall assign a hearing date before the license review board. At the hearing, the applicant and the licenses and permits unit shall present all evidence regarding the application to the license review board. The license review board shall conduct the hearing and report its conclusions and recommendations to the mayor. The mayor, upon receiving the recommendation of the license review board, may, within 60 calendar days of receipt of said recommendation, deny or grant an application for a new license. In addition, within said 60-day period, if the mayor determines there is a need to correct a clear error or prevent a manifest injustice, the mayor may remand the application or matter back to the license review board for further hearing. If the mayor fails to take action within the 60-day period, the recommendation of the license review board shall become the final decision of the mayor.
Annual/renewal fees for a license under this subsection are $500.00. In no event shall an owner/operator of a gymnasium, health club, aerobics club or slimnastics club be required to pay for more than one license under this subsection. In the event that a single owner/operator has more than one type of activity within a single business, that owner/operator shall obtain the more inclusive license of either a gymnasium or health club.
