CHAPTER 25. - SPECIAL PERMITS

Sec. 16-25.001. - Intent: Classes of special permits.
Three (3) classes of special permits are established for the purpose of this part:
(a)
Special use permits, decided by the council after public notice and hearing and recommendation by the zoning review board, are intended to be used in connection with uses of substantial significance or of unusual operational characteristics.
(b)
Special administrative permits are intended to be used where complex or unusual technical determinations are involved and/or in conjunction with temporary uses and structures. Such permits shall be processed by the bureau of planning.
(c)

No building or occupancy permit shall be issued for any structure or use requiring any of the above special permits until such special permit has been obtained, and any such structure or use shall be in full accord with the requirements and limitations set forth in such special permit. No such permits shall be required or issued except in classifications specifically provided for in this part, or other than in accord with the procedures, standards and requirements set forth in connection therewith.
(1)
Conditions: In granting special permits, such conditions may be attached as are deemed necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and surrounding properties. Such conditions shall generally be of a nature as so stated in (3) below, "Construction, generally."
(2)
Transfer: A special permit, together with any conditions and safeguards attached, is granted to an individual, firm or corporation. Such permit may be transferred to another individual, firm or corporation only upon approval in the manner hereinafter described:
a.
Special use permits: The transfer of a special use permit is authorized upon the approval of the director of the office of zoning and development after a request for such transfer has been filed with the office of zoning and development by the proposed new owner or operator, provided that requests for transfers of special use permits previously conditioned in a manner that prohibited transfer of the permit shall not be authorized. Authorized requests for transfer shall be accompanied by an affidavit certifying that the new operator or owner is thoroughly familiar with and will abide by the terms of the original special use permit including all conditions, as well as all other materials required by an application form promulgated by the director. The director shall notify the chair of the NPU within which the property is located that a request for transfer has been made, which notice shall be sent by electronic mail immediately following acceptance of the transfer application. The director shall approve the request only upon a finding that the new owner or operator meets each of the following criteria:
i.

The height of each such antenna shall be regulated and limited in relation to the following: Proximity to residential structures and residential district boundaries; the surrounding topography; the surrounding tree coverage and foliage; and the design of the antenna, with particular reference to design characteristics which have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. In no event, however, shall any such antenna exceed the minimum height necessary to accomplish its intended function as certified by a registered engineer licensed by the State of Georgia. Said certification shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall be submitted to the City of Atlanta Bureau of Planning at the time application for said special use permit is made. Further, under no circumstances shall any such antenna exceed 200 feet in height as measured from existing grade. Equipment and structure related to such antennas shall not exceed the height limitation specified in the zoning district in which the property is located.
(e)
Such antennas and related equipment and structures shall be painted in a neutral color identical to or closely compatible with the surroundings, and in such a manner as to make the antenna and related equipment and structures as visually unobtrusive as possible.
