The intent of the council in establishing and updating the SPI-17 Piedmont Avenue Special Public Interest District as a zoning district is as follows:
1.
Implement provisions of the Comprehensive Development Plan incorporating certain recommendations contained in studies of this area including the 2016 comprehensive study known as Midtown Garden District Master Plan;
2.
To provide, through the administration of specific standards and criteria, that new development achieves architectural, site and street design consistent with the existing historic built environment;

Facilitate safe, pleasant, and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and vehicles;
5.
To encourage owner occupancy and retention of single-family and low-density family residential structures compatible with the character of the Midtown residential neighborhood;
6.
To develop an appropriate transition between higher densities in Midtown SPI-16 district to the west of Piedmont Avenue and lower densities in Midtown residential area along and east of Piedmont Avenue, in such a way as to reinforce visual continuities, urban design linkages, appropriate transportation corridors, and neighborhood street patterns;
7.
To provide appropriate and distinct entrances into the Midtown neighborhood to the east;
8.
To require general compatibility between and among new structures and historic buildings within the Piedmont Avenue Special Public Interest District;
9.
To provide and protect existing single and low-density residential housing along Piedmont Avenue that does not detract from adjacent single-family housing.
10.
Prevent encroachment of incompatible commercial uses and parking into residential neighborhoods;
11.
Protect the historic character of Piedmont Avenue and the adjoining residential neighborhoods;
12.
To protect and enhance traditional buildings and uses within the 10th Street commercial node by retaining historic structures and uses and encouraging the redevelopment of non-historic properties compatible with historic structures.

( Ord. No. 2022-08(22-O-1060) , § 1(Exh. A), 4-27-22)
Sec. 16-18Q.004. - Application procedures.
1.
A special administrative permit (SAP) application and a specified number of copies each of a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the office of zoning and development prior to filing for a building permit. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), new or expanded outdoor dining, or work which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building facades that would reduce the configuration of street facing openings, shall be subject to said SAP approval. All applications for a SAP shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures contained in Chapter 25 of Part 16 except as otherwise modified by this Chapter 18Q. No SAP shall be issued until after such time any other required special use permit or board of zoning adjustment action has been obtained.
2.
In addition to SAP submittal as specified above, the applicant shall also provide one copy of the full SAP application to the appropriate neighborhood planning unit (NPU) chair or their designee for the purpose of notification and comment. Said appropriate NPU shall have a period of 21 days from the date of the mailing to provide a set of written comments to the bureau of planning for their consideration prior to any SAP approval.
3.
Administrative variations: As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the office of zoning and development may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings, to be filed as a public record, that either:
a.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accordance with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent of such regulations, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree than strict enforcement of such regulations would provide; or
b.
In the circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at that time or in the future.
c.
Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter or part to the contrary, no administrative variation shall be authorized for those listed in Section 16-18Q.009 for the board of zoning adjustments.
4.
The office of zoning and development may exempt certain classes of applications for SAPs from detailed review requirements as set forth upon written findings that generally within these districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or scale as to make detailed reviews and approval unnecessary. Where applications for special administrative permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful.
5.
For the purposes of this chapter, a unified development plan approved under a single SAP and meeting all floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements, may be subdivided, even if the resultant parcels do not otherwise meet these requirements. Any changes from the approved SAP shall require a new or amended SAP, which shall be based on the geographic extent of the original SAP and shall meet floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements of such; and shall indicate built or planned improvements on the original parcel(s). Where a single property owner no longer owns all parcels, the applicant shall obtain authorization from all property owners prior to permit submittal.
