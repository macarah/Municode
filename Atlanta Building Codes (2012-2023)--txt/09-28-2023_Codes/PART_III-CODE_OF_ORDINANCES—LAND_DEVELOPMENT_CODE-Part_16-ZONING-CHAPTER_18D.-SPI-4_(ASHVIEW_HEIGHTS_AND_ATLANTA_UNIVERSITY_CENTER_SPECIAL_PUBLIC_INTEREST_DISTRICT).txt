CHAPTER 18D. - SPI-4 (ASHVIEW HEIGHTS AND ATLANTA UNIVERSITY CENTER SPECIAL PUBLIC INTEREST DISTRICT)

Sec. 16-18D.001. - Scope of provisions.
The regulations set forth in this chapter or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are the Regulations of the Atlanta University Center (AUC) and Ashview Heights Special Public Interest District (SPI-4). These regulations shall supplant existing districts or portions of existing districts as shown on the attached map referenced in section 16-18D.004, except that all existing categories of historic protection designated pursuant to Chapter 20 of Part 16 shall continue in full force and effect and said existing historic protection regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, the regulations set forth in this chapter. Whenever the following regulations are at variance with said existing historic protection regulations, the historic protection regulations shall apply. The SPI-4 AUC and Ashview Heights regulations shall take precedence over the Atlanta Zoning Ordinance whenever a conflict between the two exists. When specific reference is not provided in the SPI ordinance, the Atlanta Zoning Ordinance, as amended, shall apply.
The regulations set forth in sections 16-18D.001 through section 16-18D.021 shall apply to all properties located within the SPI-4 AUC and Ashview Heights, including all subareas within the district.

Sec. 16-18D.002. - Statement of intent.
The intent of the Council in establishing SPI-4 as a zoning district is as follows:
(1)
Preserve, protect and foster the redevelopment of AUC and Ashview Heights through the integration of transportation and land use planning in a way that balances local, regional, and state economic benefits;
(2)
Preserve and protect AUC and Ashview Heights's historic buildings and sites as recognized by the inclusion of several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places;
(3)
Encourage the development of housing that provides a range of opportunities for citizens within the district;
(4)
Encourage a compatible mixture of residential, commercial, industrial, cultural and recreational uses;
(5)
Create an urban environment where people can live, work, meet and play;
(6)
Promote pedestrian safety by providing for pleasant and convenient sidewalk level pedestrian circulation that minimizes impediments by vehicles;
(7)
Encourage the use of MARTA and other public transit facilities and alternative transportation modes;
(8)
Combine elements of stormwater mitigation and green infrastructure throughout the AUC and neighboring Atlanta Housing properties and the Castleberry Hill neighborhood to reduce runoff and improve water quality; and
(9)
Enhance the efficient utilization of accessible and sufficient parking facilities in an unobtrusive manner, including encouraging shared parking and alternative modes of transportation.

Sec. 16-18D.003. - Boundaries of district established.
The boundaries of the SPI-4 AUC and Ashview Heights are shown on map Attachment B which by this reference is incorporated into and made a part of this chapter and this part. The SPI-4 AUC and Ashview Heights Special Public Interest District is divided into 13 subareas as shown on said map Attachment B and which are described as follows.
All subareas are regulated by both conventional zoning and development standards and guidelines. The intent of these standards is to establish clear minimum development standards, allow for the orderly progression of development, and provide flexibility over time without compromising the goals and objectives of SPI-4.

Sec. 16-18D.004. - Application procedures.
(1)
A special administrative permit (SAP) application with a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior facade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the Office of Zoning and Development prior to filing for a building permit. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), new or expanded outdoor dining, or work which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building facades, shall be subject to said SAP approval. All applications for a SAP shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to said SAP applications contained in Chapter 25 of Part 16 except as otherwise modified by this chapter 18D. No SAP shall be issued until after such time any other required special use permit or board of zoning adjustment action has been obtained.
(2)
Administrative variations: As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the Office of Zoning and Development may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings, to be filed as a public record, that either:
a.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accordance with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent of such regulations, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree than strict enforcement of such regulations would provide; or
b.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at that time or in the future.
c.
Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, maximum (as applicable) parking and loading requirements, and signage limitations.
(3)
The office of zoning and development may exempt certain classes of applications for SAPs from detailed review requirements as set forth upon written findings that generally within these districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or scale as to make detailed reviews and approval unnecessary. Where applications for special administrative permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful.

Sec. 16-18D.021. - Stormwater management.
All developments in SPI-4 shall consider the following subject to the approval of watershed management.
(1)
Stormwater measures that can capture runoff with a combination of cisterns, ephemeral streams, greenways, landscaping, and wetlands.
(2)
Other measures to reduce runoff that include but are not limited to green roofs, permeable pavements, vegetated swales, etc.
(3)
The inclusion of specific AUC institutions as part of the strategy: Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Morris Brown College, and the Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC),
(4)
The inclusion of the nearby Castleberry Hill neighborhood and the Atlanta Housing Authority properties as part of the strategy.
Work would be broken into four separate projects and would capture the 22.4 MG (million gallons) of stormwater runoff generated during to a 100-year storm event. Project designs should be implemented in accordance with applicable local laws and the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, Volumes 1 and 2, 2016 edition.
An integrated and comprehensive approach of incorporating stormwater mitigation measures and green infrastructure is more suitable than costlier alternatives such as developing separate water runoff and sewer systems. Stormwater runoff can be retained in cisterns for re-use and detained on floodplains to prevent the overloading the sewer system. A development may utilize stormwater detention as a recreation space in SPI-4.
