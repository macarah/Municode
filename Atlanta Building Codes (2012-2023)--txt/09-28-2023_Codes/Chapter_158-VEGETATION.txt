Sec. 158-35. - Penalties.
(a)
Legal. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article, and which results in the illegal injury or destruction of a tree, shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided in section 1-8 of the Atlanta Code of Ordinances. The tree conservation commission shall have the authority to determine when a person has violated any of the provisions of this article and shall have the authority to impose and enforce the fines described herein. Where the tree conservation commission is able to determine the exact number of trees upon which a tree protection ordinance violation occurred, a fine imposed for the first violation shall be no less than $500.00, and the fine imposed for each subsequent violation shall be $1,000.00. Each tree upon which a violation occurred shall be deemed a separate violation of the tree protection ordinance. Where the tree conservation commission is unable to determine the exact number of trees upon which a tree protection ordinance violation occurred, the commission shall assume a density of 1,000 inches DBH of trees per acre, and specifically shall assume that the lot contains 60 trees of 16.67 inches DBH per acre, and shall impose a fine of $60,000.00 per acre of land where the offense(s) occurred. Where the subject property is smaller than one acre, the fine shall be pro rated. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. The owner of any building, structure or site, or part thereof, where anything in violation of this article exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or agent of the owner, or any tenant who commits or assists in the commission of any violation of this article shall be guilty of a separate offense.
(b)
In addition to paying the penalties set forth in subsection (a) above, any tree of six inches or larger DBH except pines, or any pine tree of 12 inches DBH or larger, that is removed or destroyed in violation of this article shall be replaced or recompensed by the violator, as set forth in section 158-103.
(c)
Tree protection. Fences surrounding root save areas must be erected before the commencement of any land disturbance, demolition or construction. Fences must comply with City of Atlanta arboricultural standards and must be constructed of chain link, wood, or substantial mesh material, with a minimum height of four feet. Chain link or substantial wood fencing must be used in the following circumstances:
(1)
All commercial, multi-family residential, and mixed-use development projects;
(2)
Protection of trees in the front yards of single-family residential properties;
(3)
Protection of trees that have been approved for CRZ impacts greater than 20 percent;

Any other situation where the city arborist finds a signific ant risk of damage to a saved tree's critical root zone. The city arborist may require these measures at any time, including after commencement of site disturbance.
No activity, including construction material storage, shall occur in areas protected by tree fences. Tree protection fences must remain in place and upright until such time as final landscaping of a site requires their removal. The arborist may assess recompense against the violator if, in the arborist's opinion, the incursion has converted trees from the status of saved trees to the status of injured, lost, or destroyed trees, as set forth in this section above.
(d)
Other violations during construction that do not result in destruction or injury to a tree.
(1)
During the course of construction, where the city arborist is able to determine the responsible party is not abiding by the city arborist approved plans for tree protection (e.g., failing to maintain a tree construction fence), the first violation will result in a correction notice or stop work order. The second violation within the same development project will result in a correction notice or stop work order and a fine of $500.00, all subsequent violations shall result in a fine of $1000.00.
(2)
Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense.
(e)

If no such finding is made, the tree conservation commission shall deny the appeal. The tree conservation commission shall have the authority to reverse, affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the administrative official's decision being appealed, and to that end shall have all of the powers of the administrative official. These powers shall include, where applicable, the power to direct the issuance of a permit, provided that all requirements imposed by this article and all other applicable laws are met.
b.
In the event that the tree conservation commission rules that recompense and/or a fine should be assessed, but also finds that the amount of recompense owed or fine assessed cannot be paid as a result of financial hardship, the commission shall have the authority to reduce the fine or recompense. The commission shall create written guidelines by which to determine whether and to what extent financial hardship exists. These guidelines shall include a requirement that the person requesting a finding of financial hardship make a written request and provide documentary evidence of such hardship. The specific documents to be provided shall be determined by the commission and listed in the guidelines. The commission shall apply these guidelines consistently any time that a hardship request is made. Where the commission finds, based upon the hardship request, the supporting documentation, and the guidelines, that a financial hardship exists, the commission shall have the authority to reduce or completely eliminate the amount of recompense and/or fine owed, as long as said decision is consistent with the guidelines. The commission shall issue a written decision regarding the financial hardship request and shall provide in writing the basis for that decision.
c.
Any person desiring to appeal a decision of the tree conservation commission under subsection 158-65(b) shall notify the clerk of the commission, in writing, of such intent within six working days of the date of the written decision of the commission.

The filing of an appeal in the superior court from any decision of the commission shall not ipso facto act as a supersedes, but the city shall abide by any supersedes granted by Fulton County Superior Court.
(c)
Frivolous appeals. An appeal may be dismissed as frivolous by a vote of the commission in advance of the time that would be set for hearing. In such instances, the members of the commission may be polled without meeting. An appeal is frivolous if it clearly appears from the face of the notice of the appeal and the justification set forth, that no facts could be brought forth at a hearing that could sustain such an appeal as a matter of law. In the event that an appeal is dismissed as frivolous, all parties shall be notified in writing by the clerk, and the clerk shall also give immediate notice by telephone, e-mail, or facsimile transmission to the appellant, advising the appellant of his or her right to appeal. Any person desiring to appeal a decision of the commission under subsection 158-65(c) shall notify the clerk of the commission in writing of such intent within three working days of the written decision of the commission. Barring such notice of intent the stay on the activity appealed from shall be lifted.
(d)
Appeals of cash recompense. An appeal whose sole purpose is to request an adjustment in cash recompense shall not prohibit the issuance of the arborist's final approval of a plan if the appellant submits with the appeal, a bank certified check, or a money order payable to the City of Atlanta in the amount of the calculated recompense that occasions the appeal.

(1)
The property must contain one or more of the following, as determined by or at the direction of the department of parks and recreation commissioner and the department of city planning commissioner: i) 80 percent or more canopy cover; ii) minimum forestation standards of 1,000 DBH inches; and/or iii) 50 mature trees per acre.
(2)
The purchase of the forested property must be authorized by a duly-enacted city ordinance, and said ordinance shall include the following:
a.
The property must explicitly be dedicated and preserved in perpetuity as forested land;
b.
The property must be available for public use without cost (subject to Atlanta's park rules and other applicable city ordinances);
c.
Use of the property must be restricted to passive recreational activities with minimal environmental impact, as determined and established in writing by the department of parks and recreation commissioner based on the characteristics of the property; and
d.
The department of parks and recreation commissioner shall provide a property restoration and maintenance plan as an attachment to the ordinance.

This includes the removal of dead, dying or hazardous trees or invasive species that present a significant threat to the health of the trees, and staff or contractors to administer such services. This initial stabilization, clean-up and maintenance period shall not exceed three years from the purchase date of the property. Any expenses beyond three years after the purchase date shall be considered long-term maintenance costs and shall not be funded from the tree trust fund but rather from the operations and maintenance budget of the department of parks and recreation or a source other than the tree trust fund. No funds from the tree trust fund may be used for permanent infrastructure, including but not limited to the development or maintenance of roads, parking lots, trails, buildings or similar infrastructure, on the property.
Any allocation of maintenance dollars from the tree trust fund for any of these specified uses must be authorized as a separate procurement or expenditure, in a manner consistent with applicable city ordinances.
(3)
The department of parks and recreation commissioner and the department of city planning commissioner shall jointly develop a written list of factors and a process for evaluating parcels that may be suitable for acquisition as forested property.

The owner of the property on which the subject tree is located has submitted an application to the city arborist in a form prescribed by the city arborist.
(2)
The application is not for the removal of a boundary tree unless the adjoining property owner is a co-applicant for the permit.
(3)
The application is not for the removal of a right-of-way tree or any other public tree. For the purpose of this section a right-of-way tree is a tree deemed by the arborist to have majority of its root system in the public right-of-way.
(4)
There has been no removal of a tree pursuant to this subsection 158-101(i) for five years from the date of an application previously approved pursuant to this subsection, unless the tree(s) previously permitted and removed was leaning by greater than 20 degrees, as measured at breast height of the tree, toward an existing single family residential dwelling structure or duplex located on the subject property. The five year time period between a previously approved application and a new application shall apply to the property and shall not be affected by any change of ownership or reconfiguration of the property boundaries. Any property which is combined with any part of any other property which has already removed a tree pursuant to this subsection within the five-year time period shall not be eligible for removal under this subsection. In the event that a lot with reconfigured property lines has received more than one approval under this subsection, the latest approved application shall be considered for deciding when a new application may be received.
(5)
No lot of record which is not developed with a single family residential structure or duplex within its property lines shall be granted a permit to remove a tree pursuant to this subsection regardless of whether the zoning of the property will only allow the development of single family residences or duplexes on the property.
(6)
When determining the distance of the tree from the structure, the tree shall be measured at the base of the tree, where the trunk of the tree meets the ground, on the side of the tree that is closest to the structure at issue.
(7)
When determining the location of the foundation of the structure at issue, any portion of the structure constructed on piers or pilings shall not be deemed to be part of the foundation.
(8)
No posting of the property is required prior to the issuance of a permit.
(9)
Only the property owner shall have appeal rights associated with the permit. such appeal rights shall be as set forth in section 158-65 of this article.

Where a permit is issued, the property owner shall not be required to replace the tree or pay recompense, except that where removal of the tree will result in the loss of ten percent or more of the tree canopy on the subject property, as determined by the city arborist, issuance of the permit shall be contingent upon the property owner's planting a replacement tree(s) on the subject property pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article.
(11)
Where a tree is removed without a permit, recompense and fines shall be calculated and owed as prescribed throughout the tree protection ordinance, even if the property would have been eligible for a tree removal permit pursuant to this subsection 158-101(i).
(12)
The city arborist shall not issue a permit if the tree at issue is located on property that was the subject of a violation of the tree protection ordinance within one year of the filing of the permit application.
(j)

a.
The city's department of watershed management has submitted an application to the city arborist in the department of city planning in a form prescribed by said city arborist.
b.
For trees located within a city easement that are not boundary trees, the department of watershed management may destroy, remove and/or injure trees as prescribed in section 158-103(c)(6) of this tree protection ordinance, except that the number of trees to be destroyed, removed and/or injured may be determined by acre rather than by tree per tree or sampling techniques, and except that specimen trees need not be identified. A maximum shall be set on recompense at $5,000.00 per acre, prorated. A site plan drawn to scale shall be required for these trees showing locations impacted by acre, but not showing individually impacted trees. No survey shall be required. For purposes of this section 158-101(j), the city shall be deemed to have an easement on land above city sewer lines.

This site plan must include each tree's critical root zone, structural root plate, whether it's a boundary tree, silvicultural prescriptions to be used if applicable, and the construction methodology to be utilized by location. It shall also provide a calculation of the percentage of impact on each tree that is not removed. A survey shall be required showing all impacted trees falling within this category, though the survey may be performed by GPS coordinates, via a sketch describing each tree and showing its DBH. The sketch need not be performed by a registered surveyor or landscape architect. The application shall include recompense calculations, and proposed plantings of new trees. The city shall give recompense credit to the department of watershed management for newly planted trees only if the replanting requirements set forth in the tree protection ordinance are met (other than those requirements set forth in subsections 158-101(b) through 158-101(i)), but shall not give any recompense credit for new trees planted within the city's easement. The department of watershed management shall not be required to replant trees within a city easement.
d.
Except for trees located within a city easement that are not boundary trees, the department of watershed management's site plan must designate all specimen trees. The department of city planning 's city arborist may discuss with the department of watershed management alternative routes for the work to be performed that may allow the specimen tree to survive, though the city arborist may not deny the removal/destruction application in the event that the department of watershed management does not agree upon an alternative route.
e.
In the event that a public property tree, as defined in section 158-26 above, is located in part on a city easement or other private property, the permitting decision shall be made by the city arborist in the department of parks and recreation.
(2)
The city arborist in the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs may issue a permit to the department of watershed management to remove, destroy, and/or injure any public property tree, including without limitation trees located on city parks, streets, sidewalks, and other property owned by the City of Atlanta, when such removal, destruction, or injury is performed as a result of the City of Atlanta's compliance with the consent decrees, provided that the following requirements are met:
a.
The city's department of watershed management has submitted an application to the city arborist in the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs in a form prescribed by said city arborist, provided that applications may be made by projects, as defined in the consent decrees. Applications may be made on a quarterly basis provided that the application for each tree to be removed is submitted and approved prior to the tree's removal.
b.
For destruction or removal of or injury to a public property tree, the department of watershed management shall submit a site plan drawn to scale that meets the standards set forth in 158-105 of the tree protection ordinance. This site plan must include each tree's critical root zone, structural root plate, size, species, silvicultural prescriptions to be used if applicable, and the construction methodology to be utilized by location. It shall also provide a calculation of the percentage of impact on each tree that is not removed. A survey shall be required showing all impacted trees falling within this category, though the survey may be performed by GPS coordinates, via a sketch describing each tree and showing its DBH. The sketch need not be performed by a registered surveyor or landscape architect. The application shall include tree DBH inches removed, and proposed plantings of new trees.
c.
The department of watershed management's site plan for public property trees must designate all specimen trees. The office of parks' city arborist may discuss with the department of watershed management alternative routes for the work to be performed that may allow the specimen tree to survive, though the city arborist may not deny the removal/destruction application in the event that the department of watershed management does not agree upon an alternative route.
d.
In the event that a private property tree, as defined in section 158-26 above, is located in part on city-owned property, the permitting decision shall be made by the city arborist in the department of city planning.
e.
The department of watershed management must replace all public property trees that it destroys, removes, or injures on public property owned by the City of Atlanta, such that the DBH of the replacement trees is equal to or greater than the cumulative DBH of the trees removed, destroyed, and/or injured. The city shall give credit to the department of watershed management for newly planted trees only if the replanting requirements set forth in the tree protection ordinance are met (other than those requirements set forth in subsections 158-101(b) through 158-101(i)), with the following exceptions:
i.
The replacement trees need not be located within the same NPU district or within one mile of the NPU boundary from which the tree was removed, destroyed or injured, as prescribed by section 158-103. For purposes of this section, the city arborist shall consider the entire city for purposes of eligible areas for replanting.
ii.
The city arborist in the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs need not approve a tree replacement plan prior to issuing a tree removal permit, provided that:
(a)
The commissioner of the department of watershed management or her/his designee, working in good faith cooperation with the director of the office of parks or her/his designee, is unable to identify locations in which to plant the requisite number of replacement trees at the time of granting the tree removal permit.
(b)
The director of the office of parks, or her/his designee, calculates the number of caliper inches of trees that must be replanted in order to satisfy the tree protection ordinance's inch per inch replacement requirement. S/he shall communicate that number in writing to the commissioner of the department of watershed management or her/his designee.
(c)
The department of watershed management agrees to plant, at its own expense, the requisite number of trees, as calculated by caliper inch, within the time frame described in the immediately following subsection (d). It shall be the responsibility of the department of watershed management to identify potential sites for replanting, but upon request, the director of the office of parks, or her/his designee, shall make a good faith attempt to assist the department of watershed management with this task. The exact location of the replacement trees, the type of trees, and the size of each tree must be approved by the director of the office of parks or her/his designee prior to the trees being planted. The director of the office of parks shall forward this replanting information to the impacted councilmember for review. The department of watershed management shall guarantee the life of each replacement tree for two years from the time of planting.
(d)
The commissioner of the department of watershed management and the commissioner of the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs enter a letter of understanding that accompanies each decree tree removal permit (as defined below). The letter of understanding must set forth those replacement inches for which locations have already been identified, and additionally the number of caliper inches that the department of watershed management must and agrees to plant by a date certain but for which locations have not yet been located. The date certain shall be no greater than one year after the effective date of the decree tree removal permit, except that under extenuating circumstances, the commissioner or her/his designee may approve an extension. The letter of understanding shall also include the requirements set forth in subsection (c) immediately preceding this subsection (d).
(e)
The department of watershed management prepares an annual report showing, for each project for which a letter of understanding was executed, the number of trees planted, the size by caliper inch of each tree planted, the type of each tree planted, the approximate date of planting, and the remaining balance of trees for each application. This report shall be submitted to the director of the office of parks by no later than May 1 of each year.
iii.
The city arborist need not require the replacement trees to meet the descriptions set forth in section 158-103, but rather may give replacement tree credit as follows:
(a)
For replacement trees that meet the requirements of section 158-103, the replacement credit shall be the DBH of the replacement tree.
(b)
The department of watershed management may plant understory trees on public property for the purpose of restoring stream banks or other environmentally sensitive areas. The replacement credit shall be the DBH of the replacement tree.
(c)
The department of watershed management may be given replacement credit for planting a live stake on public property for the purpose of stream bank erosion control, stream bank stabilization, or stream or wetland restoration. The replacement credit shall be the DBH of the live stake, except that a live stake with a DBH that is less than one caliper inch shall be credited as one caliper inch.
(d)
The department of watershed management may be given replacement credit for removal of invasive species from trees on public property where the species threatens the life of the tree. The replacement credit shall be the DBH of the tree saved.
(3)
The following provisions shall apply to the issuance of tree removal permits by the city arborist in the department of city planning and in the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs, where the removal or destruction of a tree is performed as a result of City of Atlanta compliance with the consent decrees ("decree tree removal permit"):
a.
Sections 158-101(j)(1) and (2) above notwithstanding, no city arborist shall require the department of watershed management, as part of its decree tree removal permit application, to produce evidence of consent by a private property owner regarding removal or destruction of a tree that impacts said private property owner's property. Impact of tree removal from privately owned property will be addressed directly by the department of watershed management.
b.
No posting of the property is required prior to the issuance of a decree tree removal permit.
c.
There is no appeal right associated with a decree tree removal permit. The tree conservation commission shall not have the authority to hear or in any other way consider an appeal regarding the granting or denial of such permit.
d.
The department of watershed management may not remove, destroy, or injure any private property tree or public property tree in order to comply with the consent decrees prior to being issued a decree tree removal permit by the city arborist in the department of city planning, or in the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs respectively.
e.
Where a tree is removed, destroyed, or injured without a decree tree removal permit during work related to the decrees, the department of watershed management must report the removal, destruction, or injury to a city arborist by the close of the following business day. In such instance, the appropriate city arborist shall calculate the recompense due and/or tree replacement required. Where a city arborist learns of a decree-related tree removal or destruction caused and not timely reported by the department of watershed management or its contractor/subcontractor, the appropriate city arborist shall issue penalties pursuant to section 158-34 above, and shall also require that recompense be paid and/or replacement be performed.

No. 2022-45(22-O-1829) , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-22)
Sec. 158-102. - Criteria for removal, destruction or injury.
(a)
No permit shall be issued for the removal, destruction, or injury of any living, healthy, and non-hazardous tree unless:
(1)
A site plan and tree replacement plan meeting the requirements of section 158-105 has been approved;
a.
The city arborist has reviewed the application and determines the following:
1.
The application and plans submitted to the city are accurate;
2.
The design is appropriate to the site conditions, no trees are being removed unnecessarily, and the improvements cannot reasonably be designed or positioned to further increase tree protection;
3.
All reasonable efforts have been made to plan the construction or demolition methods and site access with protection of trees as a priority;
4.
The site plan shows that damage to trees during grading, construction, demolition, or utility installation will be minimized by using construction methods and products proven to protect existing trees. Construction methods and protection measures may be required by the city arborist and must be indicated on the site plans. These methods and measures may include but are not limited to:
i.
Reuse of cleared, paved, or previously developed areas including, but not limited to driveways, parking lots, former building footprints, and lawns;
ii.
Directional boring instead of open trenching for utility installation;

iv.
Retaining walls and use of pier and beam foundations to reduce tree impacts from site grading;
v.
Use of mulch, gravel, plywood, geotextiles, swamp/access mats, and temporary decking, alone or in combination per City of Atlanta Arborist standards to prevent soil compaction from vehicular traffic and material storage; and
vi.
Any other methods, materials, or techniques that meet with current arboricultural industry standards and are approved by the city arborist.
(2)
All other requirements of this article are met; and
(3)
One of the following conditions exists:
a.
The tree is located within the buildable area of the lot and the applicant has been granted a building, landscaping, or other permit to make improvements otherwise permissible under all applicable ordinances of the city;
b.
The tree is located in that portion of the setback or required yard area of the lot that must be used for vehicular ingress and egress or for the installation of utilities that cannot be accomplished in a manner allowing preservation of the tree;
c.
The tree is of an undesirable or invasive species;
d.
The tree removal qualifies for a permit pursuant to section 158-101(i) or section 158-101(j).
(Code 1977, § 10-2037(d); Ord. No. 2001-102, § 2, 12-11-01; Ord. No. 2003-03, §§ 1, 2, 1-13-03; Ord. No. 2006-04, § 1, 2-14-06; Ord. No. 2007-32(07-O-0362), §§ 10, 18, 6-12-07; Ord. No. 2009-13 (09-O-0399), § 3, 3-24-09; Ord. No. 2022-45(22-O-1829) , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-22)
Sec. 158-103. - Standards for tree replacement and afforestation.
(a)
Minimal impact on trees; replacement trees. Each applicant for a permit to remove, destroy or injure trees shall, to the maximum extent feasible, minimize the impact on the trees on the site. The applicant shall plant replacement trees on site that equal the total number of trees being removed, destroyed, or injured, provided that where the removed, destroyed or injured trees were located on public property, the cumulative DBH of the replacement trees shall be equal to or greater than the cumulative DBH of the trees removed, destroyed and/or injured. Where construction of improvements or existing dense tree cover precludes the planting of the total number of replacement trees required on the site, the city arborist may approve a plan which results in the planting of the number of trees on the site which can reasonably be expected to be accommodated in a manner which will allow mature growth of the replacement trees. The remainder of the total number of trees may be planted in a local park, on public lands, or along right-of-ways, subject to approval of the City of Atlanta Parks Department, provided such plantings are within the same NPU district or within one mile of the NPU boundary.
(1)
Where appropriate site conditions exist, replacement trees shall be overstory or mid-canopy species. Understory trees shall be permitted where site conditions do not allow the planting of overstory or mid-canopy trees. Overstory trees shall be planted at no less than 25-foot spacings if planted in a single row. When planted with other overstory or mid-canopy trees on three sides or more, the overstory trees must be spaced no less than 30 feet apart. Mid-canopy trees shall be planted at a minimum of 20 feet on center. Understory trees shall be planted at a minimum of 15 feet on center.
(2)
Spacing variations. The city arborist may approve planting distances less than the standard spacing as appropriate for the project type and site conditions. Denser plantings may be allowed or encouraged for stabilization, environmental restoration, reforestation, or similar projects.
(3)
Replacement credit may not be given for columnar or fastigiate species or cultivars unless approved by the city arborist based upon site conditions that would not be appropriate for a broad canopy. If replacement credit is given, then each columnar or fastigiate tree will receive only half credit.
(b)
Recompense. The difference between the number of trees removed, destroyed or injured (Nrem) and the number of trees replaced (Nrep) on a site times the established recompense value shall be calculated as partial recompense to the tree trust fund. In addition, the difference between the total diameter at breast height of the trees removed or destroyed (TDBHrem) and the total caliper inches of the trees replaced on site (TCIrep), as indicated on the approved tree replacement plan, shall be calculated as partial recompense to the tree trust fund. Total recompense(R) shall be calculated according to the formula:
R = $100.00 (Nrem - Nrep) + $30.00 (TDBHrem - TCIrep), C >=0
(c)
Limits and adjustments.
(1)
For recompense purposes of this section, all trees except pines with a minimum DBH of six inches shall be included in the formula. Pines with a minimum DBH of 12 inches shall be included in the formula.
(2)
For new subdivisions, new lots of record, and vacant lots, a maximum shall be set on recompense at a pro rated per acre basis by zoning classification as tabulated below, provided that no less than the specified minimum of existing trees, by total DBH inches, are retained on a site. Credit based on the established recompense value formula will be given for trees planted. This credit may be subtracted from maximum recompense per acre, provided trees are spaced at no more than one tree per 400 square feet.

PD, PD-H, PD-MU, PD-OC, PD-BP, SPI Districts, Landmark Districts, and other special zoning categories** Treat according to underlying zoning categories Treat according to underlying zoning categories
  *Vacant lots shall be based upon the lower Minimum Trees Retained total DBH inches, new subdivisions and new lots of record shall be based upon the higher Minimum Trees Retained total DBH inches.
**Where an underlying zoning category does not apply, the Minimum Trees Retained (MTR) for planned developments shall be derived by multiplying the required percentage of the site required to be retained in pervious area by a factor of .60 which will establish the Minimum Trees Retained percentage (MTR%). This amount shall be calculated according to the formula:
Required Pervious Area (K) x .60 = MTR%
Maximum Recompense Per Acre = $10,000.00
(3)
Provided that no less then the specified minimum of existing trees, by total DBH, are retained on a site in accordance with Table 158-103 then the maximum recompense per acre may be further reduced by the replanting of new trees. Adjusted maximum recompense per acre (AMRPA) shall be calculated according to the formula:
Reduction from MRPA = $100.00 (Nrep) + $30.00 (TCIrep)
AMRPA = MRPA - Reduction from MRPA
(4)
For sales housing units which have a pro-forma sales price equal to or less than 1.5 times median family income as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the percent of minimum trees retained may be reduced to 50 percent of the above percentage values in order to qualify for maximum recompense per acre.
(5)
For sales housing units which have a pro-forma sales price greater than one and one-half times median family income but not exceeding two and one-half times median family income as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the percent of minimum trees retained may be reduced to 75 percent of the above percentage values in order to qualify for maximum recompense per acre.
(6)
For trees removed in the required construction of streets and related infrastructure in new subdivisions or other planned developments, a maximum shall be set on recompense at $5,000.00 per acre, pro rated. Credit based on the established recompense value formula shall be given for trees planted. This credit may be subtracted from maximum recompense per acre, provided trees are spaced at no more than one tree per 400 square feet. For infrastructure development that requires disturbance of one acre or more, a recognized sampling technique performed and certified by a registered forester may be substituted for an actual count of the trees to be removed. All specimen trees must be identified by species and location regardless of the counting procedure adopted.
(7)
Conservation easements [and fee simple donations] (section 158-32) that result in the preservation of wooded lands, or newly created wooded parkland afforested to 100 inches DBH per acre, and that are perpetual in duration shall receive a credit of $20,000.00 per acre, pro rated, against recompense fees. Natural water detention areas established in lieu of the construction of detention ponds shall qualify as conservation easements if so deeded as a conservation easement. In addition, a fee simple donation of land that is afforested to 100 inches DBH per acre, and that is accepted by the city, will receive a credit of $20,000.00 per acre, pro rated, against recompense fees, but only if the city dedicates the land for a use that will preserve the land in its natural scenic landscape or in a forest use.
(8)
For rental housing units that have at least 20 percent of the total number of residential units constructed being within the ability to pay of those households whose annual incomes do not exceed 60 percent of the median family income for the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area, the percent of minimum trees retained may be reduced to 50 percent of the above percentage values in order to qualify for maximum recompense per acre.
(d)
An impacted tree will not be considered destroyed and will not be charged recompense only if all the following are met:
(1)
Tree save fencing is established and maintained to protect at least 67 percent of the root save area, and the structural root plate is not disturbed.
(2)
An ISA certified arborist or registered forester is retained to prescribe and monitor the implementation of measures to maximize the survival and protection of the tree, including but not limited to root pruning, canopy pruning, mulching, watering, fertilization, and enhanced protective fencing.
(3)
The prescription of the retained arborist is approved by the city arborist or city forester in advance of construction.
(4)
A report on the effectiveness of the prescribed measures is submitted by the retained arborist to the city arborist or city forester prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(e)
A lost tree shall be charged recompense regardless of whether or not it is removed from the site.
(f)
The city arborist shall prepare a quarterly report to be presented to the tree conservation commission. The report shall include the total number and DBH of trees removed and/or the total number and DBH of trees replanted during the preceding quarter in each of the following categories: maximum recompense per acre, dead/dying/diseased/hazardous removal, landscaping permit, silvicultural removal, buildable area removal, parking lots, illegal removal, off-site planting, or any other permit or penalty category not listed. The report shall also include acreage, total number of trees and total DBH for any newly created conservation easements or newly created parklands.
(g)
Minimum tree cover. In any request for a permit for construction in which no trees are proposed to be removed, or in cases where trees are being removed but the total tree cover on the lot is less than the minimum tree cover per zoning district, the city arborist shall require an afforestation standard such that the minimum tree cover per zoning district is satisfied, provided that all such trees so planted can reasonably be expected to be accommodated in a manner which will allow mature growth of the new trees.
Tree replacements per zoning district and the minimum required tree coverage (TDBH + TCI) on a site, regardless of any loss of trees, are as follows:
R-5, R-4-A and R-4-B districts: 35 inches per acre
R-3, R-3-A and R-4 districts: 40 inches per acre
R-2 and R-2-A districts: 100 inches per acre
R-1 districts: 150 inches per acre
RG, PD and all other districts: 90 inches per acre
(h)
A healthy tree preserved on site may not be counted towards the minimum tree coverage requirement if it has invasive vines such as English Ivy, Chinese Wisteria, or similar species growing in the crown or on the trunk of the tree that may impact the health of the tree now or in the future.
(1)
A site will not pass the final arborist inspection for a certificate of occupancy until invasive vines on healthy trees are killed by severing the vines at the ground and removing a four-foot vertical section of the vine from the tree trunk.
(2)
Invasive vines must be removed or killed in a manner that does not cut or damage the bark, poison or otherwise harm the tree. Vines should not be pulled from the upper parts of a tree because this can damage the tree.
(3)
A list of invasive vines is included on the list of undesirable and invasive species, maintained by, and available from, the arborist division.
Replacement trees shall typically be a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper. Regardless of caliper or diameter at breast height, trees planted as a requirement of this article or trees planted using tree trust funds shall not subsequently be removed or destroyed without a permit from the city arborist.
(4)
The city arborist may approve, pursuant to the conditions set forth in section 158-34(a), the planting of trees smaller or larger than 2.5 caliper inches as appropriate for the project type and site conditions. Smaller trees may be allowed or encouraged for environmental restoration, slope plantings, reforestation, or similar projects. Similarly, understory tree species that are unavailable from nurseries in a 2.5 caliper inch size may be approved for planting at a smaller size. All planted trees will be awarded replacement credit based on the size in caliper inches of the tree.
(i)
Species of replacement trees.
(1)
Species of acceptable replacement trees are listed o n the city's recommended tree list which is available from the arborist division. The city arborist may approve species that are not on the list if the city arborist deems it an appropriate species and suitable for site conditions.
a.
Prohibited replacement trees. No tree on the list of undesirable and invasive species may be planted to meet tree replacement and afforestation requirements. Recompense credit will not be given for planting undesirable or invasive species.
(2)
Species diversity required. Species diversity creates resilience in the urban forest and reduces the impacts of pests and disease. To ensure continued resilience, a diversity of tree species will be needed on each site. The species of planted trees should adhere to the following diversity guidelines, unless the trees preserved on site, coupled with the replacement trees, offer a comparable diversity of species and genera.
a.
When four to 10 trees are proposed to be planted, no more than 50 percent of the replacement trees shall be of a single species.
b.
When 11 to 20 trees are proposed to be planted, no more than 33 percent of the replacement trees shall be of a single species.
c.
When 21 to 50 trees are proposed to be planted, no more than 20% of overall trees planted shall be of the same species, no more than 50 percent shall be of the same genus.
d.
When 51 or more trees are proposed to be planted, no more than 20 percent of overall trees planted shall be of the same species, and no more than 30 percent shall be of the same genus, with the exception of the genus Quercus (Oaks) which may make up 50 percent of the trees planted.
e.
Approximately 75 percent of replacement trees planted on any project should be species native to the Piedmont region of Georgia.
f.
New tree planting in zoning-mandated streetscapes or on other highly urbanized sites may have the species diversity standards adjusted or waived at the discretion of the city arborist.
(3)
Mixture of mature tree sizes. Where appropriate site conditions exist, afforestation and replacement tree plantings shall be overstory and mid-canopy trees. Understory trees shall be permitted by the city arborist where site conditions do not allow the planting of overstory or mid - canopy trees. Where understory trees are allowed, they should generally make up no more than 25 percent of the required plantings.
(j)
Minimum planting areas and soil volumes. To ensure the health, longevity, and desired mature size, all trees must be provided ample healthy soil to grow. Trees do best when planted together in large open planting areas of uncompacted native or suitably amended soil. Where conditions or the design restricts the establishment of large open planting areas, suspended pavement techniques or other comparable methods may be used to provide adequate volumes of uncompacted soil below paving or other hardscape.
(1)
Soil surface area. Each tree must meet the following soil surface areas and utilize uncompacted, high quality native or amended planting soil per the city's technical planting specifications and must be approved by the city arborist.
a.
Overstory trees: 400 square feet.
b.
Mid-canopy trees: 250 square feet.
c.
Understory trees: 100 square feet.
d.
When trees are planted together in a single planting area, the required soil area for each tree within the shared planting area may be reduced by 25 percent.
e.
The minimum dimension of a tree island or other constrained planting shall be five feet in width for understory and mid-canopy trees and eight feet in width for overstory trees. The city arborist may allow less than the minimum widths when the city arborist allows the reuse of existing planting wells or where space between an existing building and street does not allow for the minimum tree island width and sidewalk or streetscape components required by the property's zoning. When a new building is being constructed, the minimum widths shall be required.
f.
When applicable, the city arborist may allow alternative methods and materials to be used, such as engineered underground channels, or root chases, that direct root growth and allow tree roots to establish soil connections by having access to adjacent open space as a means of increasing available soil.
(2)
Soil volume for planting within hardscaped areas. For tree plantings in constrained areas where the soil surface area requirements cannot be met, rooting area for trees below paving may be created by using suspended paving over soil cells filled with high quality topsoil, above ground planters filled with high quality topsoil, or other approved designs or methods. Installation of suspended paving systems must follow manufacturer's guidelines, or the planting specifications maintained by the arborist division. Minimum soil volumes must be as follows:
a.
Overstory Trees: 800 cubic feet of soil.
b.
Mid-canopy Trees: 500 cubic feet of soil.
c.
Understory Trees: 200 cubic feet of soil.
d.
When trees are planted together and share soil within a continuous planting area, the required soil volume for each tree within the shared planting area may be reduced by 25 percent.
e.
The minimum depth of soil in a suspended pavement system or planter is two feet and the maximum depth is four feet.
f.
In suspended pavements, understory and mid-canopy trees must be provided a minimum of five-foot-by-five-foot non-paved open soil area around the tree trunk. Overstory trees must be provided a minimum of eight-foot by eight-foot non-paved open soil area around the tree trunk.
(3)
The city arborist may allow for deviations from the required soil volumes, or percentage of overstory trees due to site constraints outside of the control of the applicant.
(k)
Street trees required.
(1)
All sites, residential and commercial, must have trees planted along any public or private road at a maximum spacing of 40 feet, with allowances for driveways, and within ten feet of the back of curb or back of sidewalk if the distance between the sidewalk and curb is insufficient for planting trees.
(2)
All street trees, other than those planted during infill development on single-family residential lots, must be overstory or mid-canopy species, with at least half of the trees being overstory species.
a.
Where overhead utilities are present, the city arborist may approve understory trees to be used.
b.
Zoning-mandated streetscape tree planting requirements supersede the 40 feet spacing requirements for public street frontages.
c.
The city arborist may waive or alter the street tree planting or spacing requirement if there are sufficient trees growing along the street frontage of the property, whether at regular or irregular spacing, or if conditions prevent planting on 40-foot spacings. The city arborist may also allow other adjustments to the requirements, including allowing understory species or a larger percentage of mid-canopy species to address planting constraints outside of the applicant's control.
(3)
Residential subdivisions in which public infrastructure is installed must submit a tree replacement plan showing proposed tree plantings on common property for the entire development, including streets, in order to get final arborist approval for any land disturbance permits. The trees shown on the tree replacement plan must also be shown on the final plat that is approved by the office of zoning and development.
a.
All public and private streets within a subdivision must meet the street tree planting requirements described in this section.
b.
Tree planting options. Replacement trees shown on the tree replacement plan may be planted by the applicant under the land disturbance permit or may be deferred to the subsequent phases of construction.
1.
Option 1: Planting under land disturbance permit. Trees planted under the land disturbance permit will be given replacement credit for that permit. These replacement trees must be inspected by the city arborist prior to the approval of the final plat and must be protected from all impacts during future home construction phases.
2.
Option 2: Planting during subsequent building phases. Trees shown on the tree replacement plan that are not planted under the land disturbance permit s hall be planted during subsequent phases of construction. The city arborist will work with the applicant to designate which of the trees shown on the tree replacement plan are to be associated with new individual lots, upon which they shall be planted as a requirement to obtain the final certificate of occupancy.
(l)
Planting priority. The location of tree plantings required by this section normally shall be prioritized as follows:
(1)
Heat islands. Streets and other external heat islands shall be shaded by new or existing trees at a spacing not to exceed 35 feet on center on average, with a minimum of two trees per lot when feasible. Street trees shall be planted as close to the street as is practicable. Internal heat islands shall be shaded at a minimum rate of one tree per 750 square feet of heat island area.
(2)
Soil stabilization. Replacement trees shall next be planted on steep slopes and other erodible areas and on the banks of wetlands and waterways.
(3)
Following satisfaction of priorities (1) and (2), the applicant shall have discretion to satisfy additional tree planting requirements either by planting on the subject site, on another location approved by the city arborist, or by contributing the appropriate amount to the tree trust fund.

(a)
The city arborist shall require that improvements be located so as to result the protection of the trees on the site. It is the specific intent of this section to require that damage to trees located within the setback and required yard areas and to trees located on abutting properties owned by others be minimized to the greatest degree possible under the particular circumstances, as determined by the city arborist according to the following guidelines:
(1)
On lots and subdivisions of one acre or more, the applicant shall identify environmentally sensitive areas as part of the site plan required in section 158-105 below. Such areas shall include wetlands, floodplains, permanent and intermittent streams, stands of trees and other significant aspects of the natural environment on site. Limits of disturbance to these areas shall be established and detailed on the site plan. In order to protect the more environmentally sensitive areas, development shall be confined to the portion of the lot required for the intended construction.
(2)
On lots and subdivisions of less than one acre, root save areas shall be established in the setback and required yard areas to preserve trees in those areas. Grading, trenching, or other land disturbance in these areas shall be limited to necessary hydrologic and erosion control measures and access corridors to streets, utility connections, or other features required by code. In order to protect the trees in the setback and required yard areas, building shall be confined to the portion of the lot required for the intended construction.
(3)
A maximum of ten percent of the trees in a designated wetland or 100-year floodplain may be approved for removal or destruction.

Sec. 158-110. - Dead or diseased trees; nuisances.
The provisions of this section shall apply to all property in the city, as follows:
(1)
Generally. Any dead or diseased tree or part of a tree is a nuisance when, by reason of such condition, natural forces may, more readily than if such tree or part thereof were live or not diseased, fell or blow such tree or part thereof onto public ways or public property, off of the property of the owner of such tree, and thereby imperil life or property or impede traffic. When a dead or diseased tree which is alleged to constitute a nuisance is brought to the attention of the parks arboricultural manager or city arborist, the parks arboricultural manager or city arborist, in their discretion, may submit through the director, bureau of parks a written opinion to the director, bureau of buildings. Upon receiving a written opinion from the director, bureau of parks that any tree or part thereof is a nuisance as defined in this section, the director, bureau of buildings shall commence nuisance abatement proceedings.
(2)
Notice to owner to remedy conditions; failure to comply. The director, bureau of buildings shall give written notice to the owner or the person in possession, charge or control of the property where a tree nuisance as defined in this section exists, stating that in the city arborist's opinion the tree or part of a tree does constitute a nuisance that shall be removed, and requesting that such removal be done within a reasonable time to be specified in such notice. In no event shall such reasonable time exceed ten working days. Such notice shall further state that unless the tree or part thereof is voluntarily removed within the time specified, the director may cause summons to be issued requiring the party notified to appear in the municipal court to have there determined whether the tree or part of a tree involved constitute a nuisance and should be abated. If the tree is not removed within the time specified by the director, the director may cause the owner of such tree, or the person in possession, charge or control thereof, to be summoned to appear before the judge of the municipal court to determine whether or not the tree or part of a tree involved constitutes a nuisance.
(3)
Hearing; failure to comply with order to abate. If upon such a hearing as provided for before the judge of the municipal court, the judge shall find that the tree or part of a tree constitutes a nuisance and orders the defendant to abate the same within a specified time, then each ten days that the conditions adjudicated to be a nuisance by the judge are maintained subsequent to the expiration of the time fixed in the judgment of the judge the same to be abated shall constitute an offense.
(4)
Emergencies. Such nuisance trees pose immediate hazards and, because of the imminence of danger, are too great a risk to leave standing while standard procedures for giving notice take place. In such cases where danger to the public is imminent, the director of the office of parks shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enter the property and abate the nuisance, and the reasonable costs of such work, as documented by the office of parks, shall be reimbursed by the department of city planning. The department of city planning shall have the authority to obtain reimbursement from the property owner.
