CHAPTER 44. - UPPER WESTSIDE OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 16-44.001. - Scope of regulations.
These regulations constitute the Upper Westside Overlay District ("the district"). The scope of these regulations is as follows:
(1)
The existing zoning map and underlying zoning regulations governing all properties within the district shall remain in full force and effect. The regulations in this chapter shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, these underlying zoning regulations.
(2)
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all properties in the district, except properties with an underlying zoning designation of:
(a)
R-1 through R-5; and
(b)
PD-H and exclusively used for single-family or two-family dwellings.
(3)
Whenever the following overlay regulations vary from the underlying zoning regulations, another overlay, or conditions of rezoning, the more restrictive shall apply.
( Ord. No. 2023-13(22-O-1742) , § 1(Att. A), 4-26-23)
Sec. 16-44.002. - Findings and statement of intent.
The district is a unique part of Atlanta containing a wide mix of land uses that range from single- family residential, to mixed-use, to industrial. These are traditionally organized into a development pattern consisting of distinct low density residential areas separated by rail corridors, roadways, commercia/industrial uses, or major public facilities.
Recently, the district has experienced significant growth, especially in its traditional industrial and commercial areas, where piecemeal redevelopment is now common. Often, this redevelopment abuts residential areas.
The city finds that rapid evolution of portions of the district from industrial and commercial uses to a diverse mixture of residential, commercial, industrial, and open space uses requires special consideration to ensure that future development and redevelopment provides a mix of uses that promotes the public health, safety, and welfare.
The City also finds that rapid rail and Atlanta Beltline transit opportunities in the district are currently limited, making the use, block, streetscape, access management, and transportation management provision of this chapter appropriate given these transportation realities.
Therefore, in establishing the district it is the intent of the city to:
(1)
Implement provisions of the comprehensive development plan, which incorporates certain recommendations contained in studies of this area, including the Upper Westside Masterplan and BeltLine Subarea 8 and 9 Master Plans;
(2)
Balance increasing residential, retail, and offices uses with the district's ongoing industrial and commercial uses and existing residential neighborhoods;
(3)
Provide more regulation of businesses that are incompatible with other uses in the district due to excessive noise, dust, smoke, traffic, vibration, light, or similar impacts;
(4)
Provide more regulation of businesses that attract large numbers of people in combination with alcohol sales by the drink during late evening and early morning hours;
(5)
Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and vehicles, in keeping with Vision Zero Policy adopted by the city.
(6)
Encourage the increased use of alternative modes of transportation and mobility such as walking, biking, and public transportation;
(7)
Support the creation of an interconnected street network of small blocks and inter-parcel access to evenly distribute traffic, improve access throughout the district, reduce congestion, and further walking, bicycling, and transit use; and
(8)
Provide more regulation of certain auto-oriented uses, especially traffic congestion, roadway safety, and resulting conflicts with pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit riders.

Sec. 16-44.004. - Procedures.
modified
(1)
Special administrative permit requirements.
(a)
A special administrative permit (SAP) application shall be submitted and approved by the director of the office of zoning and development, under the requirements specified in section 16-25.004, prior to the issuance of a building permit. The application shall submit a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade, as applicable. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), expansions of outdoor dining or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building facades that alters the configuration of openings, shall subject said site plan and building elevation approval as part of the SAP.
(b)
The director of the office of zoning and development may exempt certain classes of applications for SAPs from detailed review requirements as set forth upon written findings that generally within this district, the actions proposed are of such a character or scale as to make detailed reviews and approval unnecessary. Where applications for SAPs are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful.
(c)
In addition to SAP submittal specified above, the applicant shall email one copy of the full SAP application to the appropriate neighborhood planning unit (NPU) chair or their designee for the purpose of notification and comment. A signed affidavit of said notification shall submitted to the director of the office of zoning and development. Upon request of the NPU chair, the applicant shall also provide one printed copy of the full SAP application to the NPU chair or their designee. The NPU shall have a period of 21 days from the date of the email to provide one set of written comments to the office of zoning and development prior to any SAP approval.
(d)
In addition to the NPU notification specified above, the applicant shall email one copy of the full SAP application to the Upper Westside Community Improvement District.
(e)
Where regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the SAP for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for a special exception or special use permit.
(2)
Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.
(a)
As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the director of the office of zoning and development may authorize variations from regulations generally applying, except where otherwise prohibited, based on written findings that either:
(i)
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or
(ii)
In the circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future.
(b)
Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record.
(c)
Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, maximum (as applicable) parking and loading requirements, and signage limitations. Variances may be granted by the BZA only in accordance with section 16-26.003 (Conditions of granting a variance).

Alternative standards. The required sidewalk components and widths may be modified as specified under "Alternative Standards" in Table 1: Upper Westside Sidewalk Table, subject to the following:
(a)
Conformance with city projects.
(i)
Applicability. This alternative shall only apply when an official city project uses an alternative design.
(ii)
Standard. Sidewalks shall conform to the design found in an official city project, subject to approval of the Commissioner of the Atlanta Department of Transportation, provided the total width allocated to sidewalks, bicycle facilities, and multi-use trails shall be at least 15 feet.
(b)
Existing buildings.
(i)
Applicability. This alternative shall only apply when an existing building prevents the "General Standards" from being met.
(ii)
Standard. The required total sidewalk width shall be one foot less than the actual building setback from the street curb, measured on a point by point basic, but not less than the minimum widths shown in Table 1.
(c)
Existing Trees.
(i)
Applicability. This alternative shall only apply when an existing tree with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of six inches or more prevents the "General Standards" from being met unless the tree is removed.
(ii)
Standard. When the existing tree is maintained, the minimum required sidewalk width may be reduced only to the extent required to avoid tree removal, but not less than the minimum widths shown in Table 1.
(d)
Existing topography.
(i)
Applicability. This alternative shall only apply when a sidewalk is required by section 16-44.009(2)(b) (Expansion) though section 16-44.009(2)(d) (Off-site parking), but the existing topography prevents the "General Standards" from being met unless a retaining wall over four feet in height is constructed (measured at the back of the sidewalk).
(ii)
Standard. The minimum required sidewalk width may be reduced only to the extent required to avoid such retaining wall, but not less than the minimum widths shown in Table 1.
(e)
Industrial operations.
(i)
Applicability. This alternative shall only apply when a sidewalk is required by section 16-44.009(2)(b) though section 16-44.009(2)(d), but an industrial operation prevents the "General Standards" from being met without eliminating commercial vehicle access and maneuvering space, eliminating commercial vehicle loading, or requiring other changes that would render the property unusable for industrial uses.
(ii)
Standard. The minimum required sidewalk width may be reduced only to the extent required to avoid such impact, but not less than the minimum widths shown in Table 1.
(f)
Other existing site features.
(i)
Applicability. This alternative shall only apply when a sidewalk is required by section 16-44.009(2)(b) though section 16-44.009(2)(d), but an existing site feature, such as a bridge abutment, retaining wall, utility device, stream, burial site, or rock outcrop (but excluding a parking, driveways, signs, landscaping, wall, and fence), prevents the "General Standards" from being met without moving such features.
(ii)
Standard. The minimum required sidewalk width may be reduced only to the extent required to avoid moving such features, but not less than the minimum widths shown in Table 1.
(5)
Decorative pedestrian lights. Decorative pedestrian lights are required along public streets and shall be spaced as required by the BeltLine Overlay.
(6)
Transit stops. Developments more than one acre in area and adjacent to existing public transit bus stops which have no shelters shall provide a bus shelter at each stop. The design and location of such stop shall be approved by the director of the office of zoning and development.
