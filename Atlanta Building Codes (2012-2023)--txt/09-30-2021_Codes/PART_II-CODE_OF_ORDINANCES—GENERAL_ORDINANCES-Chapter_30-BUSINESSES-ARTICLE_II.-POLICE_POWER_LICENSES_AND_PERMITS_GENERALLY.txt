Sec. 30-29. - Issuance contingent upon applicant's criminal record.
(a)
Rules for consideration of applications. In considering an initial application for a license or permit issued under the police power of the city, the following rules shall apply with respect to an applicant's criminal record:
(1)
All applications for a license or permit issued under the police powers of the city shall be reviewed for criminal history. Only convictions, pleas of nolo contendere, or violations of law, including city ordinances, reasonably related to the application, shall ever be considered. A nolo contendere plea shall not be taken into consideration and shall not be cause for or used as justification for denial of the application, except as otherwise provided by law or city ordinance.
(2)
Any conviction or plea of nolo contendere for which the applicant has received either a pardon or restoration of civil and political rights from the state board of pardons and paroles shall not be taken into consideration and shall not in any way be cause for or used as justification for denial of the application.
(3)
A plea of nolo contendere or plea of guilty under O.C.G.A. tit. 42, ch. 8, art. 3 (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.), the First Offender's Act, shall not be taken into consideration and shall not be cause for the denial of the application for a license or permit, provided that the person has not more than one plea of guilty or plea of nolo contendere under that act for the commission of any act or offense in violation of the laws of the United States, the state or the city at the time of filing the application.
(4)
No conviction or plea of nolo contendere, the sentence for which shall have been successfully completed, including parole or probation, if any, more than five years preceding the filing of the application for the permit or license shall be taken into consideration or be cause for or a justification for denial of the application.
(5)
Subject to subsections (a)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section, the person or body approving or denying an application for a license or permit under the police power of the city may take into consideration the criminal record of the applicant in determining whether to approve or deny the application; provided, however, that only those offenses that are reasonably related to the job duties involved in the job for which a permit or license is sought may be taken into consideration or used as cause to deny the application. For purposes of this section, an offense is reasonably related to the job duties involved in the job if the job involved offers a greater than normal opportunity to commit the same crime or a similar crime to that of which the person was previously convicted, provided further that the convictions shall never operate as an automatic disqualification, but shall be considered along with all other relevant information by the person or body approving or denying the application for a permit or license. Subject to subsections (a)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section, the only purpose of using an applicant's prior criminal history in determining whether to approve or deny an application for a license or permit shall be to determine the applicant's ability to perform the job for which the license or permit is sought in a safe and lawful manner.
(b)
Renewals, suspensions and revocations. All renewal applications for a license or permit issued under the police powers of the city shall be reviewed for criminal history. In considering a person's criminal record or history for determining whether or not to renew, suspend or revoke a license or permit issued under the police powers of the city, the same standards shall be used as are set out in subsection (a) of this section relating to initial license or permit applications.
(c)
Factors other than criminal history. Nothing in this section shall in any way be interpreted to affect the ability of the person or body charged with the responsibility to issue, renew, suspend or revoke a license or permit to apply any proper criterion or standard, other than prior criminal history, in determining whether to issue, renew, suspend or revoke the license or permit.
(d)
Application of section. This section is intended to apply to every license to do business or permit to engage in a particular job or occupation which is regulated under the police power of the city.
(Code 1977, § 14-6002; Ord. No. 2001-10, §§ 1, 2, 2-13-01)

(a)
When any application for a license or permit to transact any business within the control of the police powers of the city is denied for cause or revoked for cause by the mayor, it shall be unlawful for the department of police to accept or consider any application for a license to operate at that location the same type of business within 12 months from the time of denial or revocation by the mayor. For purposes of this subsection the 12-month period as stated in this subsection shall be tolled during any period of time that an appeal is pending of said denial or revocation, or any period of time that by operation of law the city cannot enforce said denial or revocation, or any period of time during which there is in place a valid, voluntary agreement between the city and the entity denied a license or permit or whose license or permit has been revoked to not enforce the mayor's decision pending the outcome of litigation in any way involving said denial or revocation.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for the license review board to consider any application mentioned in subsection (a) of this section or a motion for rehearing of that application within 12 months without specific authority from the mayor. For purposes of this subsection the 12 month period as stated in this subsection shall be tolled during any period of time that an appeal is pending of the denial or revocation mentioned in subsection (a) of this section, or any period of time that by operation of law the city cannot enforce said denial or revocation, or any period of time during which there is in place a valid, voluntary agreement between the city and the entity denied a license or whose license or permit has been revoked as mentioned in subsection (a) of this section to not enforce the mayor's decision pending the outcome of litigation in any way involving said denial or revocation.
(Code 1977, § 14-6001; Ord. No. 2003-106, § 1, 11-24-03)
Sec. 30-31. - Notice to police of security measures and emergency contacts.
(a)

This information shall be kept current by the owner of the business.

(Code 1977, § 14-6003)

(b)
It shall be unlawful to make any knowing misrepresentation to the city of the use which a contractor intends to make of a minority, female or developing business enterprise, as a subcontractor or a joint venture partner in performing work under contract with the city.
(c)
These offenses shall be punishable pursuant to section 1-8.
(d)
These offenses are not intended, nor shall they be construed to supersede, supplant or nullify any ordinances pertaining to the authority of the city to debar or suspend a person from consideration for award of city contracts for the offenses enumerated in this section.
(Code 1977, § 17-11012)
Sec. 30-33. - Renewal contingent on compliance with Article III of this chapter.
At the time of the renewal of a license or permit issued under the police powers of the city, the licensee must show that the licensed business is compliant with the provisions contained in Article III of this chapter, including that they are registered with the business tax division and have been issued a certificate therefrom, where applicable. A finding of the failure by the licensee to maintain such compliance shall be due cause for refusal to renew the license or permit.
(Ord. No. 2010-53(10-O-1536), § 1, 9-29-10)
Sec. 30-34. - Authorized designee.
(a)
The mayor is hereby authorized to name a designee or designees who shall be authorized to receive applications for licenses or permits issued under the police power of the city, and to take action to either grant, deny, or remand to the license review board such license or permit applications pursuant to the applicable provisions of the City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances regulating the license or permit at issue.
(b)
