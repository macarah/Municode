(Ord. No. 2013-33(13-O-0641), § 3, 7-3-13)
Sec. 46-107. - Modification, suspension or cancellation of a permit.
(1)
After receiving a permit, the producer may request a material modification of the permit at any time by submitting to the CAOE a change request and change fee as set forth in code section 46-110. The CAOE's ability to process the change request shall be determined pursuant to the provisions established for processing applications, as set forth in subsections 46-106(2) and (3) above. The director's decision of whether to grant or deny the modification request shall be determined as set forth in subsections 46-106(4) through 46-106(14). Submission of a change request will not impact the validity of the permit already issued, except upon written request of the producer.
(2)
Where a producer has obtained a permit and abides by the material requirements thereof, the permit shall prevent the city's stoppage of activities that are authorized by the permit, except as otherwise set forth in subsection 46-107(3) below or as a result of applicable law.
(3)
In the event that the Atlanta Police Department, Atlanta Fire Rescue Department and/or other department of purview identifies a substantial public health or safety risk arising from or caused by the filming, and the producer is in material compliance with the permit, the following shall occur:
(a)
Where the substantial risk is identified prior to the commencement of the filming, the director and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview.
(b)
Where the substantial risk is not imminent and is identified after the commencement of the filming, the director and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the department of purview.
(c)
Where the substantial risk is imminent as reasonably determined by the department of purview and is identified after the commencement of filming, said department may place a stop work order on the filming if it finds that the order will likely alleviate the substantial risk. The stop work order may be issued without advance notice where the department of purview deems that a delay of the order will jeopardize public health and safety, and shall be lifted as quickly as possible after the risk is eliminated. The department of purview shall notify the director of the stop work order within two hours of its issuance. The director and applicable department of purview shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, that will minimize the length and impact of the stop work order as decided by the producer, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s) as determined by the department of purview.
(d)
Changes made to the permit pursuant to this subsection 46-107(3) shall not require payment of a change fee.
(4)
Where the director, or a department of purview in consultation with the director, determines that the producer is violating material term(s) of the permit, the director shall decide the appropriate remedial actions after consulting with the department of purview and the producer. If the director and/or department of purview finds that a substantial public health or safety risk is arising from or caused by the material violation, the department of purview in consultation with the director may place an immediate stop work order on the filming without prior notice to the producer, and consultation with the producer shall occur after the work stoppage. The consultation between the director, department of purview and producer shall evaluate the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional, whether permit modifications should be made, whether the stop work order should be lifted (where applicable), and what other actions should be taken (if any). Where the violation creates a substantial public health and/or safety risk, the remedial actions decided by the director will not be deemed final until the department of purview reviews the remedial actions and confirms that they will eliminate the health and safety risks.
(Ord. No. 2013-33(13-O-0641), § 3, 7-3-13)
Sec. 46-108. - Responsibilities of a producer once a permit is obtained.

(4)
A producer must clean and repair the filming location, and restore it to the condition it was in immediately prior to the filming, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the director and the producer. The CAOE will inspect the filming location after the filming is completed to ascertain whether this requirement has been met. Where a producer fails to fulfill this requirement, the director will bill the producer for the cleaning, repair and/or restoration costs borne by the city, and the producer must pay the invoice in full within 30 days of receipt.
(5)
Permits shall require the producer to notify the CAOE within three hours or sooner of learning of any emergency event regarding or arising from the filming that involves the media, the police or fire departments or emergency medical services.

A producer is responsible for: (a) knowing and complying with all city ordinances and other laws applicable to the filming and to the other activities arising from the producer's permit; and (b) requiring and using commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the requirement that any person working for or at the direction of the producer (including without limitation contractors) complies with all city ordinances and other laws applicable to the filming and to the other activities arising from the permit.

Permits must prohibit a producer from acting as a representative or agent of the city, and from indicating city endorsement of the filming, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the director. This provision shall not prohibit the producer's use of the city logo in the filming credits.
(9)
The CAOE shall require that notification be given to residents and businesses within a three-block radius of a location for which a filming permit has been issued. The CAOE may provide the notification, may require the producer to provide the notification, or may utilize a different mechanism for providing notification. The notification must state that a filming permit has been issued, and must include the date(s), time(s), location(s) and activities that are authorized by the permit. Additionally, the CAOE shall require that notification be given to the councilmember representing the district in which the filming will occur. The CAOE shall determine the most effective means and timing of notification based upon factors such as the type of impact that the filming will have on the neighborhood, the time between receipt of the application and commencement of the filming, the producer's budget and previous communications from a neighborhood regarding notification preferences.
(Ord. No. 2013-33(13-O-0641), § 3, 7-3-13)

(2)
The producer signs a provision agreeing to comply with all applicable environmental laws, including an agreement not to allow legally-prohibited contaminants from entering the sewage and stormwater drainage systems serving the area where the filming will occur.

The producer obtains insurance coverage in an amount determined by the city's risk manager, covers the city as an additional insured on the policy, and provides proof of the coverage in a manner established by the city's risk manager. In no event shall the risk manager base any decisions regarding the filming on the criteria set forth in subsection 46-106(14) above; and
(4)
The producer pays the permit fee and any other applicable fees set forth in section 46-110 below.
