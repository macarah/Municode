Sec. 16-20A.005. - Certificates of appropriateness.
Certificates of appropriateness within this district shall be required as follows:
(1)
When required:
a)
To change the exterior appearance of any portion of a structure within the district;
b)
To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any structure within the district;
c)
To demolish or move any contributing structure, in whole or in part, within the district;

Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II Certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I Certificates.
(Ord. No. 2003-16, § 1(Att. A), 3-11-03)
Sec. 16-20A.006. - General regulations.
The following regulations shall apply to more than one subarea in the Cabbagetown Landmark District, which includes all five subareas. certificates of appropriateness required above shall be obtained from the commission or the director, as applicable, in accordance with the following regulations:
(1)
Minimum standards. These regulations constitute the minimum standards that shall be followed and shall be applied by the commission and director.
(2)
The commission shall apply the standards in section 16-20.009 only if the standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter 20A do not specifically address the application.
(3)
Applications. Materials necessary for complete review of an application shall be submitted with the application as set forth by the director. In addition, a scaled site plan showing all improvements, photographs of existing conditions and adjoining properties, and elevation drawings of all improvements shall be submitted for all Type III certificate of appropriateness applications. For new construction of a principal building, the application shall also include a scaled drawing showing all front yard setbacks, heights of, and widths of, and the distances between all existing buildings on the block face, along with those of the proposed structure.
(4)
Additional notification. The applicant shall be given contact information for interested Cabbagetown community organizations and shall be directed to provide the organization with a copy of the submitted application and attachments within three days of submission to the commission.
(5)
Cabbagetown design guidelines. The commission shall adopt and maintain guidelines, referred to herein as the Cabbagetown Design Guidelines. These guidelines shall: further the intent of these regulations; further define elements of architectural style and applicability; provide important additional detailed information regarding the construction and renovation of historic buildings; and be used as a guide to ensure the compatibility of future development in the Cabbagetown Landmark District.
(6)
The compatibility rule.
a)
In general, the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, massing, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face, the entire block, a particular subarea (including appropriate reference to subarea style) or the district as a whole. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The element in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use on that block face or, where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use in that block face."
b)
For the purposes of the compatibility rule, height and width shall be measured at the front façade.
c)
In any instance where one contributing building of the same architectural style and like use on a block face is higher or wider by more than ten percent than any other contributing building of like use on a block face, such structure shall be eliminated in the application of the compatibility rule.
d)
Those elements to which the rule applies are noted in the regulations by a reference to the "compatibility rule."
(7)
Variances. Variance requests shall be heard by the commission which will have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16.
(8)
Financial hardship exemptions.
a)
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations to a property owner's principle residence on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner.
b)
The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant.
c)
The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
1.
The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
2.
The age of the property owner;
3.
The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought;
4.
The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants and tax abatements;
5.
The costs associated with adherence to these regulations;
6.
The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and
7.
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
d)
The commission shall consider these factors and shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate upon a finding that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations.
(9)
Minimum lot requirements. There shall be front, rear, and side yard setbacks. The distance of said setbacks shall be determined by the compatibility rule.
(10)
Subdivision of lots. The subdivision of any lot within this district shall be subject to review and approval by the commission. No subdivision of lots shall be approved by the director of the bureau of planning unless said matter has first been submitted to and approved by the commission. No subdivision of lots shall be approved unless the commission shall make a finding that the resulting lots are compatible with the historic platting pattern of the Cabbagetown neighborhood. The commission shall further find that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the block face, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots. The compatibility rule shall apply.
(11)
Subdivision of lots other than lots for one- and two-family dwellings. No new lots for multi-family, commercial, or industrial uses permitted within the Cabbagetown District shall be created except upon approval of the commission. Applications shall be made to the commission, and the commission shall not approve the creation of any new lot unless the commission shall make a finding that the resulting lot or lots are compatible with the historic platting pattern of the Cabbagetown neighborhood. The commission shall further find that the resulting lot or lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the block face, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lot or lots. The compatibility rule shall apply.
(12)
Aggregation of lots. No lots shall be aggregated except upon approval of the commission. Applications shall be made to the commission, and the commission shall not approve any aggregation of lots unless the commission shall make a finding that the resulting lot or lots are compatible with the historic platting pattern of the Cabbagetown neighborhood. The commission shall further find that the resulting lot or lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the block face, block, subarea, and the district as a whole, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lot or lots. The compatibility rule shall apply.
