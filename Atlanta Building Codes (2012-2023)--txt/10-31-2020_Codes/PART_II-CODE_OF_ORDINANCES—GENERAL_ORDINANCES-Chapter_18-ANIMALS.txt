(b)
It shall be the duty of every owner of any public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog, or anyone having any such animal in his/her possession or custody, to ensure that the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog is kept under restraint, as prescribed in subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section and that reasonable care and precautions are taken to prevent the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog from leaving, while unattended, the real property limits of its owner, custodian, or harborer, and it is securely and humanely enclosed within a house, building, fence, locked pen, or other enclosure out of which it cannot climb, dig, jump, or otherwise escape on its own volition. Such enclosure must be securely locked at any time the animal is left unattended so that children are prevented from entry and to prevent the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog from escaping.
(c)
For owners of a public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog whose animal lives out-of-doors, a portion of their property should be fenced with a perimeter or area fence. Within this perimeter fence, the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog must be humanely confined inside a locked pen or kennel of adequate size. The pen or kennel may not share common fencing with the area or perimeter fence. The kennel or pen must have secure sides, a secure top attached to all sides, the sides must be securely set into the ground or onto a concrete pad, or securely attached to a wire bottom. The gate to the kennel must be locked when the animal is unattended. This enclosure shall provide protection from the elements.

Sec. 18-171. - Notice to dangerous or vicious dog owners.
(a)
Upon receiving a report of a dog believed to be subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog within a dog control officer's jurisdiction, the dog control officer shall make such investigation necessary to determine whether such dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog.
(b)
When a dog control officer determines that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the dog control officer shall mail a dated notice to the dog's owner within 72 hours. Such notice shall include a summary of the dog control officer's determination and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing from the animal control hearing board on the dog control officer's determination within seven days after the date shown on the notice; provided, however, that if an animal control hearing board has not been established for the jurisdiction, the owner shall be informed of the right to request a hearing from the probate court for such jurisdiction where the dog was found or confiscated within seven days after the date shown on the notice. The notice shall provide a form for requesting the hearing and shall state that if a hearing is not requested within the allotted time, the dog control officer's determination shall become effective for all purposes under this article. If an owner cannot be located within ten days of a dog control officer's determination that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, such dog may be released to an animal shelter or humanely euthanized, as determined by the dog control officer.
(c)
When a hearing is requested by a dog owner in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section, such hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days after the request is received; provided, however, that such hearing may be continued by the animal control hearing board or probate court for good cause shown. At least ten days prior to the hearing, the animal control hearing board or probate court conducting the hearing shall mail to the dog owner written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the dog owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and the animal control hearing board or probate court conducting the hearing shall receive other evidence and testimony as may be reasonably necessary to sustain, modify, or overrule the dog control officer's determination.
(d)
Within ten days after the hearing, the animal control hearing board or probate court which conducted the hearing shall mail written notice to the dog owner of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the notice of classification shall specify the date upon which that determination shall be effective. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur.
(e)
Judicial review of the animal control hearing board's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 15-9-30.9. Judicial review of a probate court's final decision shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 5-3-2 and costs shall be paid as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-3-22.
(f)
If the animal control hearing board classifies the animal as dangerous or vicious, and no appeal is filed, the owner shall be required to obtain from the animal control officer an annual certificate of registration in compliance with the requirements of this article. No vicious or dangerous animal shall be released to its owners until such certificate is issued by the animal control officer.
(g)
If the owner fails to obtain the certificate of registration within 30 days of the issuance of the order classifying the animal as dangerous or vicious, the animal may be euthanized no earlier than 35 days after the issuance of the order so classifying the animal. The animal shall not be euthanized if the owner appeals the animal control board's classification order. During the pendency of the appeal and any further appeals, the animal shall not be euthanized, provided that in the event the classification order is upheld at the conclusion of all appeals, the animal may be euthanized no earlier than 35 days after the final order upholding the classification if the owner does not obtain the required certificate of registration within 30 days after the date of the final order of court upholding the classification order. During the pendency of any such appeal by the owner, the animal shall not be released to its owner until the appeal is concluded and the certificate of registration is issued to the owner, if applicable. In such event, the animal will be housed at a licensed veterinarian's office or a licensed commercial kennel and the cost of such detention shall be borne by the owner of the animal. In the event the county appeals the court's order, the animal shall not be released to its owner until the appeal is concluded and the certificate of registration is issued to the owner, if applicable. In the event of an appeal by the county, the animal will be housed in the animal control shelter and the cost of such detention shall be borne by the county.
