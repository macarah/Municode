Sec. 142-3. - Scope.
(a)
The outdoor events chapter is intended to be the framework within which all outdoor events held in the city are approved and regulated. The outdoor events chapter applies to all outdoor gatherings located within the city, regardless of whether the gathering is held on public property or private property, except that the requirements of the chapter do not apply to those outdoor gatherings discussed in subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) below. The outdoor events chapter does not apply to events that are being held exclusively indoors.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for any person or organization to hold an outdoor event without complying with the procedures set forth in this chapter, except that where an event is city-sponsored, as determined by the chief of staff, the requirements of this chapter regarding payment of fees, timing of application submission, insurance and indemnification shall not apply.
(c)
Additional outdoor event operating guidelines, policies and procedures may be developed and adopted administratively and enforced by the city.
(d)
Outdoor gatherings with a duration of greater than 90 consecutive days, or outdoor gatherings with a duration of greater than 13 consecutive weeks, where the gathering occurs on at least three days of each consecutive week, shall not be deemed an outdoor event. Such outdoor gatherings, if located on public property or private property, require a special use permit, which is obtained from the city's bureau of planning. Where said gathering requiring a special use permit occurs in a city park, the bureau of planning shall work collaboratively with the bureau of parks to determine whether a special use permit should be issued.
(e)
A gated park event shall not be deemed an outdoor event for purposes of this chapter. Gated park events shall be regulated by the commissioner of the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs, in consultation with the police chief and the fire chief. The commissioner of the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs shall approve only those gated park events that certify that they will not deny admission to the gated park event on the grounds of race, color, creed, religion, gender, domestic relationship status, parental status, familial status, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation or gender identity. In addition, the host of a gated park event will need to submit plans to the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department to receive a maximum occupancy, will need to have an internal security plan (as defined in City Code section 142-51) approved by the police department, and will need to obtain any applicable sub-permits set forth in article IV of this chapter.
(f)
The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to the use of a sports facility located on city property, including without limitation a ball field, tennis court, pool, or golf course, for the purpose for which the facility was intended, as reasonably determined by the commissioner of the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs. Rules regarding the use of such sports facilities, including making reservations for the facilities, shall be established in writing by the commissioner for the department of parks, recreation, and cultural affairs, and said rules shall be placed in the department's policies and procedures manual, provided to the SEM, and provided to the public upon request.
(g)
The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to events being held exclusively on a college or university campus. City right-of-way, regardless of its location, shall not be deemed to be part of a college or university campus.
(h)
The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to any event being held exclusively on any of the following city-owned properties, because the properties are the subject of a lease or management/operating agreement with a private party, and the lease or agreement contemplates the private party's ability to hold outdoor events on the property: The Chastain Amphitheater; the Chastain Horse Park; the Atlanta Botanical Garden; the Atlanta Zoo; the Piedmont Park Multi-purpose complex; any other city-owned property that is the subject of a lease or management/operating agreement, whereby the lease or agreement explicitly exempts outdoor events on the property from the requirements of the city's outdoor events chapter.
(i)
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as repealing other sections of the Atlanta Code of Ordinances requiring the application for and issuance of permits or licenses. Those permits or licenses must be applied for separately in accordance with the Atlanta Code of Ordinances and other applicable laws.
(Ord. No. 2006-66, § 15, 9-26-06)
Sec. 142-4. - Purpose and intent.
The City of Atlanta finds that an ever-increasing number of demands are being made upon city resources and infrastructure by applications to hold outdoor festivals and other outdoor events in the city streets, sidewalks, and parks. In addition, large outdoor gatherings on private property require the deployment of city resources. In order to conserve and allocate the city's resources, both in terms of personnel and of the natural areas and infrastructure, and to adequately protect public safety and the safety, health and welfare of outdoor event participants, neighboring property owners, residents and businesses, the city finds that it is necessary to regulate the use of the city's parks and streets by those desiring to hold outdoor events on public property, and to regulate large outdoor events on private property.
The intent of the city in adopting this outdoor events chapter is to insure that the city will have adequate advance notice of outdoor events. The city also wishes to work cooperatively with the applicant in order to properly plan for and allocate the city services that will be needed, such as security, solid waste and traffic control. The intent is also to insure that the city's parks are protected from extreme wear and tear, by limiting the number and type of events held in parks. To this end the city has authorized the creation of festival districts, so that the burden of providing a venue for outdoor festivals does not fall disproportionately upon certain districts to their detriment.
It is also the intent of the city, and the purpose of this chapter, that, insofar as is possible, the costs to the city in providing services to outdoor festivals are recouped, although it is not the intention that the cost of outdoor festival permit fees be used for revenue production. The city desires to promote and encourage events for the greater good and cultural diversity of the city, and to abate the cost thereof, where the amount of the abatement shall be determined regardless of content, message or host, in accordance with the terms of this chapter. The costs to be recouped for outdoor festivals include, but are not limited to: personnel, equipment and supplies, wastewater, utilities, park and public right-or-way maintenance (including long-term degradation), and park monitoring. The city also intends to recoup a small percentage of the city's administrative costs for other outdoor events.
Lastly, the intent of this chapter is to simplify the process that the public uses to obtain outdoor event permits. The outdoor events chapter requires all applicants to provide all application information to the SEM only, regardless of the type of outdoor event being held. If approval is required from other city departments prior to granting the permit, it shall be the responsibility of the SEM to obtain that approval or disapproval.
(Ord. No. 2006-66, § 15, 9-26-06)
Sec. 142-5. - Responsible city department.
The SEM shall be responsible for overseeing the issuance of all outdoor event permits. For a park facility reservation permit (section 142-102) or a large gathering that occurs in a park (section 142-104(b)), an applicant shall provide all information and items necessary to receive an outdoor event permit to either the SEM or the department of park, recreation, and cultural affairs. For all other outdoor events, the applicant shall provide all information and items necessary to receive an outdoor event permit to the SEM, with the exception of information required to obtain an alcohol license, as set forth in section 142-32(c) below. The specific types of outdoor events, and the information required for the permitting of each, is set forth in the remaining articles of this chapter. The SEM shall also be responsible for carrying out the other functions of this chapter, including but not limited to processing the application and maintaining any records or forms needed for such processing.
(Ord. No. 2006-66, § 15, 9-26-06)
Sec. 142-6. - Penalties for violations of this chapter.
Any person or organization violating the requirements of this chapter 142 shall be subject to the following penalties:
(a)
Any person who shall conduct, host, or sponsor an outdoor event for which a proper permit has not been obtained, shall be responsible for paying all costs that would have been owed had the outdoor event been permitted or properly permitted. The chief of staff shall determine what type of outdoor event occurred based upon observations of a member of the Atlanta Police Department who observed the outdoor event. The chief of staff shall issue a bill for the total amount owed, and the bill shall be paid in full within 30 days of receipt of the bill. The bill shall include:
(1)
An amount equivalent to what the person would have been assessed for the issuance of an outdoor event permit as set forth below in this chapter. The assessment shall be equivalent to the sum of: (a) the application fee; (b) the appropriate permit fee based upon the type of outdoor event, and based upon the number of persons attending the outdoor event, but only if such factor is normally a factor in determining the permit fee for the type of outdoor event that occurred; and (c) the sub-permit fee(s) if applicable. For purposes of determining the amount of attendees at the outdoor event, such determination shall be made by the chief of staff, based upon observations of a member of the Atlanta Police Department who observed the outdoor event; and
(2)
The cost of solid waste services, maintenance services, services required to remove human waste and refuse, supplemental services, and other restoration services.
(3)
An amount equivalent to the cost of providing the number and quality of off-duty law enforcement officers and private security guards that would have been required for the outdoor event, if any. If the outdoor event is an outdoor festival, the number and quality of required off-duty law enforcement officers and private security guards shall be determined as set forth in section 142-55 below. The cost of hiring these officers and guards shall be determined by the Atlanta Police Chief. In doing so, the Atlanta Police Chief or her/his designee shall contact a company licensed by the State of Georgia Board of Private Detective and Security Agencies, that employs such security officers, and gather the cost of contracting for such officers from the company at the time of the outdoor event.
(4)
An amount equivalent to the cost of providing the number of fire marshals that would have been required for the outdoor event, if any, as determined by the Chief of the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department. In addition, the bill shall include the cost of any violations of the Atlanta Fire Code arising from the outdoor event, as determined by the Chief of the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department, or her/his designee.
(b)
Any person who shall conduct, sponsor, host, or promote an outdoor event for which a permit has not been obtained as required by this article, shall have committed and may be charged with a misdemeanor. Upon conviction such person shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-8(c) of this Code of Ordinances.
(c)
Any host who fails to abide by the terms of the permit, or any related sub-permit, and who fails to correct her/his deviation from said terms upon oral or written notice by the city, shall have committed and may be charged with a misdemeanor. Upon conviction such person shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-8(c) of this Code of Ordinances.
(d)
Any person who shall fail to timely pay the bill described in subsection (a) of this section shall have committed and may be charged with a misdemeanor that shall be continuous with respect to time for each day that the bill is not paid. Each day that the violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense, and upon conviction, the person shall be subjected to the penalties of section 1-8(c) of this Code of Ordinances for each offense.
(e)
The provisions of this section 142-6 shall apply to any person who obtains a large gathering or private large gathering permit, as defined below in sections 142-103 and 142-115 respectively, or any other type of outdoor event permit, other than an "outdoor festival" permit, (as defined below in section 142-51(h)), where the outdoor event actually has more than 250 attendees on public property, or more than 500 attendees on private property, and meets the requirements set forth in sections 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the definition of outdoor festival; except that the failure to obtain an outdoor festival permit shall be deemed a misdemeanor only if the person obtaining the outdoor event permit should have reasonably expected that the number of attendees would exceed 250 people on public property or 500 people on private property. For events that are publicized to the general public by fliers and/or radio advertisements and/or other types of advertisements, the person obtaining the outdoor event permit will automatically be deemed as having a reasonable expectation that the number of attendees would exceed 250 people on public property or 500 people on private property.
(Ord. No. 2006-66, § 15, 9-26-06)
Sec. 142-7. - Timeframes and deadlines.
Where a timeframe or deadline established in this chapter results in an item being due on a weekend day or holiday, the item shall be due on the business day immediately following said weekend day or holiday.
The timeframes and deadlines established in this chapter that pertain to the city only, and not to the public, are administrative timeframes and deadlines only. In the event that one of these inner-city timeframes or deadlines is violated, such violation shall not impact the rights or remedies of a citizen or other person outside of city government.
(Ord. No. 2006-66, § 15, 9-26-06)
Secs. 142-8—142-10. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - APPROVAL AND DENIAL OF OUTDOOR EVENT APPLICATIONS

Sec. 142-11. - Submission of application by applicant/authority and responsibilities of the SEM once application received.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the chief of staff shall be charged with the responsibility and authority to determine whether a particular applicant shall be granted an outdoor event permit in the time, manner and place proposed; whether the proposed time, manner, and place of the outdoor event must be modified, according to criteria established by this chapter; or, whether such permit shall be denied altogether. Where this chapter requires other city representatives to approve the application before the permit is granted, the SEM shall be responsible for obtaining that approval or disapproval.
(b)
An applicant shall timely provide all information required for obtaining a permit to the SEM, except that:
(1)
Where an outdoor event requires an alcohol permit, and the alcohol server does not already possess an alcohol license, the alcohol server will need to obtain an alcohol license from the Atlanta Police Department; and
(2)
Applications for a parks facility reservation, as defined in section 142-102 below, and/or a large gathering, as defined in section 142-103 below, to be held exclusively in a city park, can be submitted either to the SEM or to the bureau of parks. In those instances where such applications are submitted to the SEM, the SEM shall forward the entire application to the bureau of parks for handling, processing, and issuance of a permit where appropriate, except that sub-permit applications shall be retained and processed by the SEM, with a copy of the sub-permit applications sent to the bureau of parks for informational purposes only. Where parks facility reservations and/or park large gathering permits are issued on a first come, first served basis, the time that an application is received shall be based upon the time that the application is received in the bureau of parks only. When such applications are submitted to the SEM, the SEM must forward the application to the bureau of parks within one business day of receiving the application. After the application has been fully processed by the bureau of parks, the entire application package shall be sent to the SEM for informational and calendaring purposes, and the SEM shall maintain the outdoor events file.
(c)
Where an outdoor event requires one or more sub-permits prior to the issuance of the outdoor event permit, other than the alcohol license as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the applicant shall provide all sub-permit information to the SEM, or to the bureau of parks in circumstances described in sections 142-102 and 142-103(b)(2). If the applicant provides all of the sub-permit information to the SEM, or to the bureau of parks where appropriate, within the time frames set forth in this chapter, the SEM shall be responsible for forwarding the sub-permit information to the city department(s) responsible for issuing the sub-permit, and said city department(s) shall forward the sub-permit, or notice of denial of the sub-permit, to the SEM. The SEM shall provide all of the relevant information and her/his recommendation to the chief of staff. If the applicant fails to meet the time frames set forth in this chapter, the chief of staff shall deny the sub-permit.
(d)
Where an outdoor gathering occurs during only one or two days of a week for consecutive weeks, unless it is a series, each non-consecutive day shall be deemed a separate outdoor event, but the applicant shall be required to file only one application and pay only one application fee for the entire sequence of outdoor events. The sequence shall be deemed over when there is a break in consecutive weeks, or when the sequence has lasted for 13 weeks, whichever is earlier. The applicant must pay an outdoor event permit fee and applicable sub-permit fees for each separate outdoor event. A series shall be treated as one outdoor event, and the applicant shall be required to file one application and pay one application fee, one permit fee, and one sub-permit fee for each applicable sub-permit.
(e)
After reviewing the comments and/or decisions from all of the city officials, employees, departments and/or bureaus from whom this chapter requires such feedback, the chief of staff shall approve the permit, deny the permit, or approve the permit with modifications or upon conditions, as set forth in this chapter. If the application is approved, the chief of staff, in consultation with the heads of affected departments, or their designees, shall impose restrictions or conditions as to time, manner and place, if the chief of staff deems such restrictions as necessary. These modifications shall be made when the chief of staff and the affected departments, based upon review of the application, find compelling reasons related only to public safety, health, or the environment, or to scheduling conflicts with other permitted uses at the time or place requested. The modifications shall not be based on any of the factors set forth in subsection 142-12(b) below. The chief of staff may deny a permit based only upon the grounds set forth in this chapter, and in particular, section 142-12 below. In no event shall permit denial be based on any of the factors set forth in subsection 142-12(b) below.
(f)
For any outdoor event whose application is due at least 30 days prior to the outdoor event, with the exception of outdoor festivals, the chief of staff shall notify an applicant in writing of her/his determination regarding the application within 15 business days after receipt of the application, but in no event later than five business days before the date of the outdoor event. For any outdoor event whose application is due less than 30 days prior to the outdoor event, the chief of staff shall notify an applicant in writing of her/his determination regarding the application no later than five business days before the date of the outdoor event or three business days after receiving the application whichever is later. For outdoor festival applications, the chief of staff shall notify the applicant in writing of her/his determination within 90 days after the receipt of the application, but in no event later than 45 days before the date of the outdoor festival. A notification shall inform the applicant of whether the applicant has been granted a permit to conduct an outdoor event without modifications to the outdoor event proposed on the application; granted a permit to conduct an outdoor event with modifications as to time, manner, or place, or with other restrictions or conditions; or has been denied a permit to conduct an outdoor event. Where the permit has been granted with modifications, the notification shall state clearly the terms of the conditions, restrictions and/or modifications.
(1)
Procedure when outdoor event permit is approved:
(A)
After the chief of staff approves the issuance of a permit, the applicant may obtain such permit by agreeing to accept any classification and/or conditions imposed in accordance with this chapter, including but not limited to payment of the applicable permit fee and any other fees required pursuant to this chapter.
(B)
The applicant must have the permit, and all sub-permits, if any, present at the outdoor event during the entire duration of the outdoor event, including but not limited to set-up and clean up. Failure to abide by this provision may result in the city's, including but not limited to any Atlanta Police Department Officer's, revoking the permit and/or any sub-permit.
(2)
Procedure when outdoor event permit request is modified or permit is denied: When the chief of staff denies a permit, s/he shall set forth in writing the reasons for such denial in as much detail as possible. When the chief of staff modifies a permit application, s/he shall, if requested by the applicant, state in writing on the permit the reasons for the modification in reasonable detail. A modification, denial or revocation based upon inadequate police resources, as described in subsections 142-12(a), (b)(3) and (i) below, shall state with specificity the reasons for the chief of staff's opinion, giving as much detail as is possible. In denying the permit, or in granting the permit with modifications, the chief of staff shall abide by the provisions of section 142-12(b) below. Where a permit for an outdoor festival is denied or modified, the chief of staff or her/his designee shall forward a copy of the written determination to the councilmember(s) of the affected district.

Any aggrieved applicant shall have the right to a hearing before the mayor or her/his designee, provided that the request for such hearing is made to the mayor within five business days after the applicant's receipt of the chief of staff's determination. The designee may be a hearing officer appointed for that purpose. The person conducting the hearing must be impartial, and must have had no involvement in the chief of staff's determination.
(A)
Where the chief of staff's determination notice is given only by mail, the mayor shall presume that the notice was received three business days after the mailing.

(B)
Should the mayor or her/his designee believe that the chief of staff's modification or denial of the permit was based on public safety reasons, s/he shall refer the appeal to the chief of police or the fire chief, as appropriate. In such situation, the aggrieved applicant shall have a right to a hearing before the chief of police or her/his designee, or the fire chief or her/his designee, as the mayor or her/his designee deems appropriate. The person conducting the hearing must be impartial, and must have had no involvement in the chief of staff's determination.

(6)
The written decision of the person conducting the hearing shall be the final decision of the city in the matter, and shall be subject to review by the Superior Court of Fulton County by a petition setting forth an appeal and naming the City of Atlanta as the defending party. The city shall expedite its response to such petition so as to allow the provision of a judicial determination of the matter no later than ten days prior to the date of the outdoor event, if possible.

Festival monitors shall be assigned to each of these permitted outdoor festivals by the SEM. Wherever possible, festival monitors will be assigned to the same festival district for consistency. At all times and for each shift when an outdoor festival is being staffed by festival monitors, the SEM shall designate one of the festival monitors as the senior monitor. The host shall provide the senior monitor with a phone number at which the host or her/his designee can be reached at all times throughout the outdoor festival, including without limitation set-up and take-down of the outdoor festival.

To this end, the police chief or her/his designee may consider the advice and counsel of public safety professionals and persons with expertise in handling or promoting similar events. Consideration of similar events shall include, without limitation, consideration of the location, the time of day or night, the sale or non-sale of alcohol, the number of locations of alcohol sale/distribution if any, the number of street closings if any, the internal security needs of similar events, and the internal security needs of other outdoor events sponsored by the host. This consideration shall not include the message of the proposed outdoor festival, the content of any speech, the identity or associational relationships of the applicant and/or host, nor any assumptions or predictions as to the amount of hostility which may be aroused in the public by the content of the speech or message conveyed by the proposed outdoor festival. The police chief or her/his designee shall forward the decision regarding the internal security plan to the chief of staff within 20 business days of receiving a copy of the plan. The chief of staff shall not issue an outdoor festival permit until s/he receives written approval of the internal security plan from the police chief or her/his designee.

Sec. 142-58. - Considerations regarding approval or denial of an outdoor festival permit.
The chief of staff and any other city representative evaluating an outdoor festival application, shall be guided by the factors set forth in section 142-12 above in determining whether to approve an outdoor festival permit, whether to approve the time, manner and place requested, whether to deny the permit as requested and propose a modified time, manner and place, or whether to deny the permit altogether. In addition, the chief of staff shall consider the following criterion:
(a)
No outdoor festival application shall be submitted to the SEM earlier than 60 days after the conclusion of an outdoor event that is the same as or substantially similar to the outdoor festival described in the new application. Any application in violation of this provision shall be denied.
(Ord. No. 2006-66, § 15, 9-26-06)
Sec. 142-59. - Outdoor festival classification.
Each outdoor festival shall be categorized as a Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, or Class E outdoor festival. In addition, each outdoor festival shall be categorized as commercial or non-commercial.
(a)
For classification purposes, the chief of staff shall evaluate the application by the anticipated number of persons attending the outdoor festival over the entire period of the outdoor festival. In estimating this number, no regard shall be given to any estimate of the number of persons who may be anticipated to be in the vicinity of the outdoor festival as counter-demonstrators or to show hostility to any message the outdoor festival may be perceived as having. Nor shall there be any consideration of any of the factors set forth in section 142-12(b) above. Unless such estimate shall appear to have been made in palpable bad faith or otherwise grossly in error, the chief of staff shall be guided by the estimate provided by the applicant. If the chief of staff determines not to adopt the estimate given by the applicant, s/he shall state the reasons in writing on the permit. The definition of each class of outdoor festival is as follows:
(1)
Class A outdoor festival . An outdoor festival at which the attendance is anticipated to be 50,000 persons or more over the entire period of the outdoor festival.
(2)
Class B outdoor festival. An outdoor festival at which the attendance is anticipated to be between 20,000 and 49,999 persons over the entire period of the outdoor festival.
(3)
Class C outdoor festival. An outdoor festival at which the attendance is anticipated to be between 10,000 and 19,999 persons over the entire period of the outdoor festival.
(4)
Class D outdoor festival. An outdoor festival at which the attendance is anticipated to be between 2,000 and 9,999 persons over the entire period of the outdoor festival.
(5)
Class E outdoor festival. An outdoor festival on public property at which the attendance is anticipated to be between 250 and 1,999 persons over the entire period of the outdoor festival, or an outdoor festival on private property at which the attendance is anticipated to be between 500 and 1,999 persons over the entire period of the outdoor festival. In addition, where an outdoor event is anticipated to have fewer than 250 attendees on public property, or fewer than 500 attendees on private property, but otherwise meets the definition of outdoor festival, and where the outdoor event provides activities that are open to the public, for example entertainment or vending, such that the number of participants may thereby increase, the outdoor event may be considered a Class E outdoor festival.
(b)
For the purpose of determining whether an outdoor festival is commercial or non-commercial, the chief of staff shall consider materials offered by the applicant. Should the applicant choose not to provide or be unable to provide documentation of its non-commercial status, the outdoor festival shall be assumed to be commercial. The non-commercial status of an outdoor festival shall be determined by:
(1)
The existence of a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service identifying the applicant as an entity recognized as one described in section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (or as amended); or
(2)
The review of tax returns filed by the applicant as it relates to the outdoor festival, showing that the proceeds of the applicant are expended exclusively in support of charitable, educational, religious, scientific or literary purposes, or for civic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare; or
(3)
The prior history of the outdoor festival over at least the past three years evidencing that the outdoor festival has consistently been non-commercial, as evidenced by past applications, conduct, previous related outdoor events, and/or appropriate documentation.

Sec. 142-80. - Title.
This article shall be known as the assembly ordinance, which is a subsection of the outdoor events ordinance. All of the definitions, requirements and other provisions set forth in article I through article V of this chapter shall apply to the assembly ordinance.
(Ord. No. 2009-04(08-O-2030), § 1, 1-31-09)
Sec. 142-81. - Definitions and clarifications.
In addition to the words, terms and phrases set forth in sections 142-2 and 142-51 above, the following words, terms, and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
(a)
"Assembly" means any outdoor event that:
(1)
Involves an organized group that: moves from one location to another upon any city street, sidewalk, park or other city-owned right-of-way; has a common purpose, design, destination or goal; and consists of persons, animals or vehicles, or a combination thereof. Examples include without limitation a march, parade, promenade, or procession of any kind. Should the moving outdoor event be immediately followed by one hour or less of stationary activity, such as a speaker, the stationary activity shall be deemed part of the moving activity. Where the stationary activity exceeds one hour, it shall be deemed a separate outdoor event that requires separate permitting if applicable; and
(2)
Requires the temporary closure or obstruction of all or a portion of any city street, sidewalk, park or other city-owned right-of-way. When at least a four-foot width of sidewalk remains unobstructed during an outdoor event, and where the Atlanta Police Department and/or the department of public works, office of transportation determine that the sidewalk will be passable during said outdoor event, no temporary closure of said sidewalk shall be required; and
(3)
Meets at least two of the following three criteria: (A) Has greater than seventy-four people; (B) Travels for greater than two blocks if on a city street or sidewalk, or is in a city park; and (C) Moving portion of the outdoor event lasts for greater than one hour; and
(4)
Does not fit into any of the following exclusions:
(A)
Funeral processions;
(B)
Students going to and from school classes or participating in education classes, provided this conduct is under the immediate direction and supervision of the proper school authorities; or
(C)
A governmental agency acting within the scope of its agency; or
(D)
The city street, sidewalk, park and/or city-owned right-of-way being closed is adjacent to property owned by another governmental entity, and/or owned by an accredited college or university, on which an event is occurring at approximately the same time that the city property is being closed.
(b)
"Block" means one side of a rectangular area surrounded by streets and usually containing buildings, measured from corner to corner.
(c)
"Street closure permit" means the permit that is required for any non-construction-related event, of any size, indoor or outdoor, for which all or a portion of: (1) any city street including without limitation a lane, and/or (2) any other city-owned right-of-way other than sidewalks, and/or (3) any city street and/or right-of-way (or portions thereof) plus the adjacent sidewalk(s), will be temporarily closed or obstructed, and where the event does not meet the definition of "assembly" or fit into any of the exceptions listed in section 142-81(a)(4) above.
(d)
"Sidewalk closure permit" means the permit that is required for any non-construction-related event, of any size, indoor or outdoor, for which: (1) all of any city sidewalk will be temporarily closed or obstructed; or (2) a portion of any city sidewalk will be temporarily closed or obstructed, such that the closure or obstruction leaves less than a four foot width of the sidewalk unobstructed, and/or the office of transportation and/or the Atlanta Police Department determines that the sidewalk will not be passable during said closure or obstruction; and 3) the event does not meet the definition of "Assembly" or fit into any of the exceptions listed in section 142-81(a)(4) above. Where the sidewalk is closed for the reasons set forth in this subsection 142-81(d), but said sidewalk is adjacent to a street or other right-of-way that will be closed pursuant to a street closure permit, the sidewalk closure shall be included in the street closure permit, and no separate sidewalk closure permit shall be required.
(e)
Clarifications: Necessity of assembly permit versus street closure permit or sidewalk closure permit during certain types of events.
(1)
Where an outdoor festival or large gathering: i) has a discreet component that involves organized group movement from one location to another, and ii) the organized group movement meets the definition above of assembly, then the moving component alone shall be considered an assembly. The applicant must receive an outdoor festival permit or large gathering permit, as appropriate, for the non-moving component of the outdoor event, and an assembly permit for the moving component of the outdoor event.
(2)
Where an outdoor event: i) requires the closure of a city street, sidewalk, park, or other right of way; and ii) meets the definition of outdoor festival or large gathering, except that it involves movement from one location to another; and iii) said movement is not a discreet component of the outdoor event but rather the sole or primary focus of the outdoor event, then the entire outdoor event shall be deemed an assembly, not an outdoor festival or large gathering, and an assembly permit shall be required.
(3)
Where an outdoor event: i) meets the definition of outdoor festival or large gathering; and ii) is non-moving, and requires the temporary closure or obstruction of all or a portion of any city street, sidewalk, park or other public right-of-way, (e.g. a block party, or an outdoor festival on private property that expands into the sidewalk and/or street), except for within one hour after the moving component of an assembly ends as described in subsection 142-81(a)(1), then the host must obtain a street closure permit and/or sidewalk closure permit for the closure in addition to the outdoor festival permit or large gathering permit, as appropriate.
(4)
Where any event that is not an assembly: i) is permitted or unpermitted; and ii) is indoor and/or outdoor; and iii) requires the temporary closure or obstruction of all or a portion of any city street, sidewalk, park or other public right-of-way; and iv) where the closure will accommodate something that is incidental to the event rather than part of the event (e.g. a party inside of a residence or other building requires closure of a street to accommodate parking or to accommodate an entranceway for guests), then the host must obtain a street closure permit and/or sidewalk closure permit for the closure.
(Ord. No. 2009-04(08-O-2030), § 1, 1-31-09)

Where the assembly is a discreet portion of an outdoor festival, as described in section 142-81(c)(1), the assembly application must be filed simultaneously with the outdoor festival application.
(C)
There shall be no exceptions to the time deadlines set forth above, unless the timing of the assembly is based upon the occurrence of an identifiable event or decision, the date of which could not have been predicted with certainty, including but not limited to an announcement regarding a military action, an announcement of a court decision, or a death. If the assembly occurs within one week of the identifiable event, the 30-day requirement for filing the application shall be waived.
(i)

To minimize impact upon public safety and traffic, the police chief or her/his designee shall recommend denial of assembly requests where the outdoor event is to occur on a weekday that is not a federal holiday, unless s/he reasonably determines that the outdoor event will create negligible traffic delays and public safety concerns. Upon granting the assembly permit, the chief of staff shall authorize the closure of the appropriate city streets, sidewalks, rights of way, and/or parks, or portions thereof, to accommodate the assembly.
(Ord. No. 2009-04(08-O-2030), § 1, 1-31-09; Ord. No. 2009-33(09-O-0805), § 9, 6-23-09; Ord. No. 2013-27(13-O-1088), § 4, 6-26-13)

Sec. 142-85. - Street closure permits and sidewalk closure permits.
Any person, organization, corporation or other group wishing to temporarily close or obstruct all or a portion of a city-owned street or right-of-way, or a city sidewalk, for an event that is not an assembly and that does not fit within the exceptions of section 142-81(a)(4), must obtain a street closure permit or sidewalk closure Permit as applicable.

(e)
When granting a street or sidewalk closure permit, the chief of police shall require that reasonable steps be taken, where possible, to minimize the adverse effect that such closing(s) may have upon the public. To minimize impact upon public safety and traffic, the police chief or her/his designee shall recommend denial of a street closure permit application where the closure is to occur on a weekday that is not a federal holiday, unless s/he reasonably determines that the closure will create negligible traffic delays and public safety concerns.
