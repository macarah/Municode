Sec. 75-18. - Definitions.
Sustainable building: Sustainable building means the integration of building materials and methods that promote environmental quality, economic vitality, and social benefit through the design, construction and operation of the built environment. Sustainable building merges sound, environmentally responsible practices into one discipline that looks at the environmental, economic and social effects of a building or built project as a whole. Sustainable design encompasses the following broad topics: efficient management of energy and water resources, management of material resources and waste, protection of environmental quality, protection of health and indoor environmental quality, reinforcement of natural systems, and integrating the design approach.
Life cycle cost analysis: An inclusive approach to costing a program, facility, or group of facilities that encompasses planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance over the useful life of the facilities and finally any decommissioning or disassembly costs. Life cycle cost analysis looks at the net present value of design options as investments. The goal is to achieve the highest, most cost-effective environmental performance possible over the life of the project.
LEEDTM rating system: LEEDTM stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, and is a voluntary, consensus-based, market-driven green building rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). It is based on existing, proven technology and evaluates environmental performance from a "whole building" perspective. LEEDTM is a self-certifying system designed for rating new and existing commercial, institutional, and multi-family residential buildings. It contains prerequisites and credits in five categories: Sustainable site planning, improving energy efficiency, conserving materials and resources, embracing indoor environmental quality, and safeguarding water. There are four rating levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.
Renovation as defined by Georgia Code § 20-2-260 refers to construction projects which consist of the installation or replacement of major building components such as lighting, heating, air-conditioning, plumbing, roofing, electrical, electronic, or flooring systems; millwork; cabinet work and fixed equipment; energy retrofit packages; or room-size modifications within an existing facility, but excluding routine maintenance and repair items or operations.
(Ord. No. 2003-108, § 2(Exh. A), 12-9-03)
Sec. 75-19. - Policy and goals.
(a)
It is the policy of the City of Atlanta to finance, plan, design, construct, manage, renovate, maintain, and decommission its facilities and buildings to be sustainable. This applies to new construction and renovations in which the total project square footage includes 5,000 gross square feet of occupied space or the total project cost exceeds two million dollars.
(b)
The LEEDTM rating system and reference guide shall be used as a guidance for design and a measuring tool to determine what constitutes sustainable building by national standards.
(c)
Facilities and buildings over 5,000 gross square feet of occupied space or two million dollars total project cost shall at a minimum incorporate sustainable design criterion as defined by this article. Design and project management teams are required to meet LEEDTM Silver rating level (33—38 points).
(Ord. No. 2003-108, § 2(Exh. A), 12-9-03)
Sec. 75-20. - Procedures and responsibilities.
(a)
The commissioners of all city departments whose responsibilities include planning, designing, constructing or renovating city-owned facilities are responsible for ensuring that facilities and buildings comply with 75-19
(b)
The city's environmental manager is responsible for coordinating to city departments any educational and technical resources available that support and promote sustainable design and construction of city facilities.
(c)
The minimum number of credits required in each of the LEEDTM categories is 33 points so that projects demonstrate performance in all categories.
(Ord. No. 2003-108, § 2(Exh. A), 12-9-03)
Sec. 75-21. - Budgeting and financing.
All capital construction which falls under this policy is required to budget LEEDTM design standards in the conceptual development of a city funded facility and/or the CDP/CIP process through the department of planning. Budget planning and life cycle cost analysis to achieve LEEDTM Silver rating is required.
(Ord. No. 2003-108, § 2(Exh. A), 12-9-03)

Sec. 75-25. - Exemptions.
The City of Atlanta Sustainable Development Design Guidelines of achieving LEEDTM certified status shall not apply to current city facilities that have been proposed in the FY02-03 capital budget. However, these projects shall still implement City of Atlanta Sustainable Development Design Guidelines and strategies to the maximum extent practicable.
Many projects do not meet the policy criteria, including some buildings smaller than 5,000 gross square feet, roadways, and other infrastructure. City facility construction projects that are unoccupied or serve specialized functions (e.g. pump station, garage, storage building, etc.) are not subject to the city's sustainable development design guidelines.
Even though projects may become exempt from the city's required sustainable development design guidelines, project managers and design teams are encouraged to apply the relevant portions of City of Atlanta Sustainable Development Design Guidelines and to develop goals that increase the environmental, social, and economic benefits of the project. In addition, all exempted projects shall complete the LEEDTM Checklist to assess any sustainable design techniques. This LEEDTM project checklist will be submitted to the appropriate city department project manager and all measures implemented shall be described in the department's annual progress report.
