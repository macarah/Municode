CHAPTER 32. - NC NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-32.001. - Authority.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the city's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to the article 9, section 2, paragraph 3 and article 9 section 2, paragraph 4, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, §§ 3-061 through 3-603, and Charter Appendix IV, §§ 41, 42, 45, 48 and 70, as well as the general police powers of the city and such other authority as may be provided by applicable, state, federal and local laws.
The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are regulations which are applicable in those parts of the city designated as NC Neighborhood Commercial district. The passage of an ordinance approving the classification of an area of the city for NC Neighborhood Commercial zoning shall supplant the zoning classifications applicable to the area so designated.
(Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00)
Sec. 16-32.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.
The City of Atlanta finds that the size, scale and character of commercial uses directly affects the adjacent neighborhoods and the public health, safety and welfare. The city finds that highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city instead of a single neighborhood or small group of neighborhoods leads to development pressure on the existing, developing and revitalizing neighborhoods and on the developing or existing historical neighborhood commercial development patterns connected therewith. The city finds there is a need to protect existing and developing neighborhood oriented commercial areas and building forms from the incompatible uses resulting from intense highway-oriented development and to preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic neighborhood commercial districts, as well as create new pedestrian oriented commercial nodes. The city finds that there is a substantial need to encourage a balanced mix of uses to include proportionately significant residential uses and to facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation. The city finds that it is necessary to improve air quality by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips. The city finds that it is necessary to establish adequate parking requirements by encouraging shared parking arrangements. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter, in establishing the NC Neighborhood Commercial District, is as follows:
1.
Protect existing neighborhood-oriented commercial areas from uses and building forms which are incompatible with the scale, character and needs of the adjacent neighborhoods;
2.
Preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic neighborhood commercial districts;
3.
Create new commercial nodes, in areas so indicated in the comprehensive development plan, which are pedestrian-oriented and provide uses which primarily serve adjacent neighborhoods;
4.
Promote a balance of retail, service, office, dining and residential uses which serve the adjacent neighborhoods;
5.
Place reasonable controls on the development of larger scale highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city than a single neighborhood or a small group of neighborhoods;
6.
Alleviate development pressure on existing neighborhoods by placing reasonable controls on development and expansion of strip commercial areas within neighborhoods;
7.
Facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles;
8.
Encourage pedestrian flow through the design of mixed-use buildings with sidewalk level retail uses, which open directly onto sidewalks adjacent to public streets;
9.
Improve pedestrian access within the district and to and from the surrounding neighborhoods;
10.
Establish building façade lines and sidewalk requirements, and reserve the space between buildings and the street for pedestrian functions;
11.
Encourage the rehabilitation or development of neighborhood commercial areas to include proportionately significant residential uses;
12.
Minimize the use of adjacent neighborhood streets for commercial area parking by establishing adequate parking requirements and encouraging shared parking arrangements;
13.
Promote a nodal form of neighborhood commercial development which is of such a size that all uses within the district are within a convenient walking distance of one another; and
14.
Include all parcels within a neighborhood commercial area as part of the Neighborhood Commercial District.
(Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00)
Sec. 16-32.002A. - Size of neighborhood commercial districts; proximity to other neighborhood commercial districts.
The Neighborhood Commercial District shall have a maximum diameter of one-half mile and shall be located at least one-quarter mile from any other NC district except where such districts are separated by the street frontage of continuous residential zoning districts. The maximum diameter limitations shall be measured in the most direct line of travel on any street between the most distant property line of any two parcels in the NC district. The proximity to other neighborhoods shall be measured from any property line in an existing Neighborhood Commercial District to any property line in the NC district to be established by a direct line of travel on any street.
(Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00)
Sec. 16-32.003. - Nominations, recommendations and legislation establishing boundaries; specific regulations for individual neighborhood commercial districts.
A Neighborhood Commercial District shall be created by an ordinance which shall be submitted for approval of the council after the completion of the procedures set forth in this chapter.
(1)
Nominations. Nominations may be initiated by city council, the director of the bureau of planning (the "director") or a minimum of ten percent of the total number of properties within the proposed district subject to the approval of the director. Nominations by city council shall be in the form of a resolution requesting the director to prepare a recommendation. The nomination shall contain information and suggestions concerning the areas, buildings, and/or premises proposed for such regulations sufficient for the bureau of planning to prepare a recommendation. Nominations by property owner(s) shall be in the form of nomination applications to the director on forms provided for such purpose and shall be deemed to be complete at such time as all supporting required documentation has been provided. No recommendation on a nomination will proceed without a complete application. When an application is complete, the bureau of planning shall prepare a recommendation to the zoning committee of the city council.
(2)
Recommendation by the bureau of planning. Recommendations concerning the establishment of a Neighborhood Commercial District shall be prepared by the bureau of planning for review. Favorable recommendations shall include an ordinance legislating creation of the district. Each favorable recommendation and associated ordinance shall identify the proposed zoning by the NC prefix and a number generated by the bureau of planning identifying the particular district, for example NC-1. The identification may also include language indicating the character or location of the district.
Such ordinance shall proceed for city council consideration in the same manner as any other rezoning ordinance.
The recommendation of the bureau of planning (the "recommendation") shall contain the following items which shall be transmitted to the zoning committee for its review. The recommendation shall be prepared only for the purpose of assisting in the evaluation of the NC ordinance and shall not become a part of the Neighborhood Commercial District chapter.
a)
Comment on proposed district boundaries. The recommendation shall include a map or maps indicating:
i.
The boundaries of the Neighborhood Commercial District and any subareas established within the district for purposes of Neighborhood Commercial regulations.
ii.
The location and zoning designation of districts or portions of districts, if any, to be supplanted by Neighborhood Commercial zoning.
b)
Alternative size and distance exception approval. Where necessary, the neighborhood commercial district maximum diameter of one-half mile may be increased. An increase may be authorized on a showing by the bureau of planning that the district size limitation would cause an otherwise suitable use to be excluded when it is located on a parcel which is only partially in the district if the one-half mile limit is imposed.
c)
Staff report. Each recommendation submitted to the council shall include a narrative staff report stating whether the bureau of Planning supports the proposed nomination of the district for Neighborhood Commercial District designation, based upon whether the NC regulations are appropriate for the nominated area, and may include such additional information and suggestions on the area, buildings and premises under consideration.
3.
Contents of the district ordinance. Each ordinance creating a Neighborhood Commercial District shall contain the following:

Upon passage of the ordinance creating the Neighborhood Commercial District, the boundaries of the district shall be shown on the official zoning maps of the city which are incorporated and made a part of this chapter.
b)
Statement of intent. Each Neighborhood Commercial District ordinance shall by this reference incorporate the statement of intent found in this chapter as well as any particularized statement of intent appropriate to the individual district being created.
c)
Incorporation of general regulations. Each Neighborhood Commercial District shall specify that the general regulations found in this chapter are applicable to the district created.
