Sec. 162-58. - Insurance; residency requirements; notice of changes; company affiliation.
In order to maintain a CPNC for a vehicle for hire, any person and any taxicab driver or company operating within the city using such CPNC must:
(1)
Obtain and maintain automobile liability insurance in the same amounts per vehicle for hire as are required of all vehicles by the state:
a.
$10,000.00 property damage;
and provide current certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage, the name of the insurance company supplying the coverage and the policy number. The insurance must provide specific coverage for a vehicle used in the business of transporting passengers. Self insurance programs approved for commercial vehicle by the state insurance commissioner shall satisfy this requirement. For the purpose of proof of insurance, the CPNC holder shall have affixed, a decal obtained monthly from the bureau to the vehicle for hire.
(2)
All taxicab companies and taxicab drivers holding CPNCs in the city shall be required to prove, on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 in which they intend to do business in the city that they have the amount of insurance which is required by the state for the operation of a motor vehicle in this state with respect to personal injury liability, property damage liability and personal injury protection benefits available to drivers, passengers, pedestrians and others. Such proof of insurance coverage may be made in either of two ways, as follows:
a.
By providing to the director, bureau of taxicabs and vehicles for hire the first day of each quarter, in the months mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, either a current insurance identification card for each vehicle intended to be operated in the coming quarter or a verified statement from a licensed insurance agent or licensed insurance company within this state setting forth the identity of the vehicles for which coverage has been procured, by vehicle identification number, make and model, the amount of coverage afforded to each such vehicle and the term for which such coverage has been prepared by the taxicab company or taxicab driver; or
b.
If the taxicab driver or taxicab company or both are covered under a self-insurance program, rather than by a licensed insurance company, by providing to the director, bureau of taxicabs and vehicles for hire the following information:
1.
The self-insurance certificate number issued by the state department of public safety;
2.
The identity of each vehicle for which coverage has been procured or approved under such self-insurance certificate for the coming quarter by vehicle identification number, make and model;
3.
The name and address of the self-insurance plan, if other than the taxicab company itself; and
4.

Investments which are equivalent to cash shall be defined, for this purpose, to include cash deposited in banks, time deposits with banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, credit unions and similar licensed financial institutions; state and municipal bonds; and such other cash investments as may be approved from time to time by the bureau, but under no circumstances to include investments in real estate or interest in real estate or investments in personal property such as motor vehicles nor shall it include promissory notes from officers of the corporation, investors or other individuals, whether secured or unsecured. This subsection shall be in addition to the requirements for the issuance of insurance stickers provided in subsection (1) of this section.
(3)
The agreement between any driver or company and any self-insurance plan shall provide that if the self-insurance plan's cash or equivalent reserves drop below the sum of $100,000.00 at any time during the quarter, the self-insurance plan shall notify the company or driver and the company or driver shall in turn notify the bureau of taxicabs and vehicles for hire. Upon verifying such information, the director shall suspend such self-insured driver or company from operating in the city unless and until the driver or company is properly insured as required by this section.
(4)
Within ten days of any of the following, the CPNC holder shall so notify the bureau in writing:
a.
Change in the chief executive officer, if a corporation, and the notification shall set out the names of the persons involved in the change.
b.
Change in the CPNC holder of 50 percent or more of the proprietary interest, if a partnership, corporation, firm or association, and the notification shall set out the names of the persons involved in the change.
c.
Change of address of the CPNC holder.
(5)

(Code 1977, § 14-8003(f))
Sec. 162-60. - Temporary CPNC for limousines.

(Code 1977, § 14-8003(g))
Sec. 162-61. - Number limited; costs.
(a)
The maximum number of taxicab CPNC's outstanding shall be 1,600, which is the number of CPNC's issued as a result of the legislative limitation established in 1995. This limitation is specifically based upon the relationship between the number of taxicabs operating within a geographic area and the quality of service they provide. An excessive number of taxicabs results in a reduced level of service and more passenger complaints. A taxicab CPNC will be issued to, and can only remain affixed to a vehicle which meets the age limitations set forth below:
No vehicle having a vehicle age greater than ten years may be operated as a taxicab in the city. For purposes of this article, the term "vehicle age" shall be determined based on the vehicle's model year, and a "year" shall be measured through the last day of that respective calendar year (for example, a vehicle with a model year of 2000 shall have a vehicle age of one year as of January 1, 2001). This ten-year age provision shall be temporary in nature and shall only remain in effect until December 31, 2013, after which time, it shall no longer be of any further force and effect, and said taxicab age provision shall revert back to a "vehicle age" of no greater than eight years.
As of August 15, 2001, no new or replacement taxicab vehicle may be operated as a taxicab in the city if such vehicle is greater than five years old. However, until December 31, 2013, any such new or replacement vehicle for which a CPNC is obtained may continue to be operated as a taxicab through that vehicle's tenth model year provided that the vehicle continues to be in compliance with all other provisions of the City Code which pertain to the regulation of taxicabs licensed to operate in the city. After December 31, 2013, any such new or replacement vehicle may continue to be operated as a taxicab through that vehicle's eighth model year provided that the vehicle continues to be in compliance with all other provisions of the City Code which pertain to the regulation of taxicabs licensed to operate in the city.
(b)
The maximum number of animal-drawn vehicle CPNC's outstanding shall be 31, which is the number of CPNC's issued as a result of the legislative limitation established in 1995. This limitation is specifically based upon the quality of service provided by animal-drawn vehicles and upon the necessity for humane treatment of the animals involved.
(c)
The maximum number of sedan CPNC's shall be 500. Any entity holding a city limousine CPNC at the time this legislation is enacted, may present the CPNC to the bureau to be converted to as a sedan CPNC. A sedan CPNC will only be issued to and can only remain affixed to a vehicle that is three years old or less as of January 1 of the year in question. This age limit will be phased in as follows:
(1)
All sedans will be five years or less as of January 1, 1996.
(2)
All sedans will be four years or less as of January 1, 1997.
(3)
All sedans will be three years or less as of January 1, 1998 and thereafter.
(d)
The cost of each CPNC issued by the bureau shall be $6,000.00 for taxicabs, $6,000.00 for sedans, and $600.00 for carriages. The market valued of any type of CPNC will be determined on January 1 of each year. Any CPNC sold by the City of Atlanta will be sold in accordance with Chapter 2, Article X of the Atlanta Code of Ordinances; and shall be sold for no less than market value during that year. No sedan or taxicab CPNC shall be sold for less than $6,000.00. No carriage CPNC shall be sold for less than $600.00.
(e)
The maximum number of CPNCs which may be issued to limousines shall be the number of those certificates which are being held on the date the ordinance from which this section derives becomes law.
(Code 1977, § 14-8004; Ord. No. 1995-37, § 2, 7-11-95; Ord. No. 1995-38, § 3, 7-11-95; Ord. No. 1998-8, § 1, 2-23-98; Ord. No. 2000-48, § 1, 8-13-00; Ord. No. 2009-09(09-O-0204), § 1, 2-23-09; Ord.

Sec. 162-61.1. - Renewal.
The CPNC holder shall apply for and obtain an annual renewal of the CPNC upon payment of a fee of $100.00 and provision of evidence that the holder continues to possess the necessary qualifications for holding a CPNC. This fee shall be paid by the last day of the month in which the CPNC was initially issued. Those persons holding CPNC's who paid annual CPNC fees between September 17, 1997 and the date on which this section becomes effective, and who can produce a receipt or other proper proof of such payment, will receive credit for such payments toward future CPNC annual renewal fees.
(Ord. No. 1995-37, § 2, 7-11-95; Ord. No. 1995-38, § 2, 7-11-95; Ord. No. 1996-10, 3-11-96; Ord. No. 2000-48, § 2, 8-13-00)

(6)
No voluntary transfer or sale of a CPNC may be made if a judgment has been filed with the bureau against the holder of a CPNC and remains unsatisfied and notice of said judgment has been filed with the bureau, except that a transfer may be permitted if an appeal is pending from an unsatisfied judgment and a bond is filed in an amount sufficient to satisfy the judgment but not to exceed the fair market value of the CPNC or CPNC's being transferred. Transfer may also be permitted without filing a bond, provided that all the judgment creditors of unsatisfied judgments file written permission for such a transfer with the bureau.
(7)
The transferee shall supply proof to the bureau that he or his transferor has filed a bond to cover all of the outstanding tort liabilities of the transferor in excess of the amount covered by a bond or insurance policy in effect at the time the claim arose; however, this requirement shall not apply to a legatee or distributee of a descendant's estate owning a CPNC.
(8)
An owner's interest in a CPNC may be transferred involuntarily and disposed of by public or private sale in the same manner as personal property. However, upon such involuntary transfer, the owner's CPNC shall immediately be canceled and a new CPNC issued to the transferee, provided that the transferee has satisfied the requirements contained above in subsection (f), except that if the involuntary transfer is by reason of a tort judgment against an involuntary transferor, no bond need be provided with respect to the same judgment.
(9)
All open items, including summons, outstanding fines and penalties against the CPNC must be cleared before a transfer will be approved. When the transferor is a corporation and there are two or more CPNC's open items against all CPNC's must be cleared in order to transfer one CPNC.
(b)
A CPNC may not be transferred during a period of suspension.
(c)
If a CPNC has been revoked, transfer will be permitted in accordance with subsection (a).
(d)
In the event of the death of any person holding a CPNC, the CPNC may be transferred by the chief to the administrator, executor or any lawful heir of the deceased person if the transferee meets all requirements for obtaining a CPNC. The CPNC shall be automatically suspended upon the death of the CPNC holder pending the presentation of letters of temporary administration to the bureau. If no application for a transfer has been filed within one year from the time of the presentation of letters of temporary administration to the bureau, this shall constitute due cause for the revocation of the CPNC. When a CPNC or stock in a corporation owning a CPNC is distributed from an estate to a legatee or distributee, the following documents shall be submitted with the transfer application:
(1)
A certified copy of the relevant death certificate;
(2)
A certified copy of letters testamentary or letters of administration; and
(3)
A copy of the will, if any, certified by the attorney for the estate.
