Commercially useful function. For the purpose of determining whether a business enterprise is performing a commercially useful function, OCC shall consider all of the facts in the record, viewed as a whole, including without limitation the following:
(1)
An MFBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved.
(2)
To perform a commercially useful function, the MFBE must be responsible, with respect to material and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, and installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
(3)
To determine whether an MFBE is performing a commercially useful function, OCC will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted by the MFBE, industry practices regarding subcontracting, whether the amount the MFBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it's actually performing, the MFBE credit claimed for its performance of the work, and other relevant factors.
(4)
An MFBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MFBE participation. In determining whether an MFBE is such an extra participant, OCC will examine similar transactions, particularly those in which MFBEs do not participate.
Control or controlled for the purpose of determining whether the owner or owners of a potential MFBE (as used in this definition, "MFBE-owner," which shall denote one or more owners) controls the potential MFBE, OCC shall consider all of the facts in the record, viewed as a whole, including without limitation the following:
(1)
For an MFBE-owner to be deemed to control the potential MFBE, the potential MFBE must be independent. An independent business enterprise is a business whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm or firms.
(a)
In determining whether a potential MFBE is independent, OCC will scrutinize relationships with other firms, in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(b)
OCC will consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the MFBE-owner and other firms or persons associated with other firms compromise the independence of the potential MFBE firm.
(c)
OCC will examine the potential MFBE's relationships with prime contractors to determine whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with a prime contractor compromises the independence of the potential MFBE firm.
(d)
In considering factors related to the independence of a potential MFBE firm, OCC will consider the consistency of relationships between the potential MFBE and other firms with normal industry practice.
(2)
A potential MFBE firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions which limit the customary discretion of the MFBE-owner. There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices (e.g., cumulative voting rights, voting powers attached to different classes of stock, employment contracts, requirements for concurrence by persons other than the MFBE-owner, conditions precedent or subsequent, executory agreements, voting trusts, restrictions on or assignments of voting rights) that prevent the MFBE-owner, without the cooperation or vote of any other individual, from making any business decision of the business enterprise. This paragraph does not preclude a spousal co-signature on documents.
(3)
The MFBE-owner must possess the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the business enterprise and to make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on matters of management, policy and operations.
(a)
An MFBE-owner must hold the highest officer position in the company (e.g., chief executive officer or president).
(b)
In a corporation, the MFBE-owner must control the board of directors.
(c)
In a partnership, the MFBE-owner must serve as a general partner, with control over all partnership decisions.
(4)
Individuals who are not the MFBE-owner may be involved in an MFBE as owners, managers, employees, stockholders, officers, and/or directors. Such individuals must not, however, possess or exercise the power to control the business enterprise, or be disproportionately responsible for the operation of the business enterprise.
(5)
The MFBE owners of the business enterprise may delegate various areas of the management, policymaking, or daily operations of the business enterprise to other participants in the firm, regardless of whether these participants are African American, Asian Pacific American, Hispanic American, or female. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the MFBE-owner must retain the power to hire and fire any person to whom such authority is delegated. The managerial role of the MFBE-owner in the business enterprise's overall affairs must be such that OCC can reasonably conclude that the MFBE-owner actually exercises control over the business enterprise's operations, management, and policy.
(6)
The MFBE-owner must have an overall understanding of, and managerial and technical competence and experience directly related to, the type of business in which the business enterprise is engaged and the business enterprise's operations. The MFBE-owner is not required to have experience or expertise in every critical area of the business enterprise's operations, or to have greater experience or expertise in a given field than managers or key employees. The MFBE-owner must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the business enterprise's activities and to use this information to make independent decisions concerning the business enterprise's daily operations, management, and policymaking. Generally, expertise limited to office management, administration, or bookkeeping functions unrelated to the principal business activities of the business enterprise is insufficient to demonstrate control.
(7)
If state or local law requires the owner of a particular type of firm to have a particular license or other credential, then the MFBE-owner of that type of firm must possess the required license or credential in order to be deemed in control. If state or local law does not require an owner to have such a license or credential, OCC will not deny certification solely on the ground that the MFBE-owner lacks the license or credential. However, OCC may take into account the absence of the license or credential as one factor in determining whether the MFBE-owner actually controls the firm.
(8)
OCC may consider differences in remuneration between the MFBE-owner and other participants in the business enterprise in determining whether the MFBE-owner controls the business enterprise. Such consideration shall be in the context of the duties of the persons involved, normal industry practices, the business enterprise's policy and practice concerning reinvestment of income, and any other explanations for the differences proffered by the business enterprise. OCC may determine that a business enterprise is controlled by its MFBE-owner although the MFBE-owner's remuneration is lower than that of some other participants in the business enterprise. In a case where someone other than the MFBE-owner formerly controlled the business enterprise, and the MFBE-owner now controls it, OCC may consider a difference between the remuneration of the former and current owner of the business enterprise as a factor in determining who controls the business enterprise, particularly when the former owner remains involved with the business enterprise and continues to receive greater compensation than the current MFBE-owner.
(9)
In order to be viewed as controlling a business enterprise, an MFBE-owner cannot engage in outside employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the business enterprise or prevent the MFBE-owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the business enterprise to control its activities. For example, absentee ownership of a business and part-time work in a fulltime firm are not viewed as constituting control. However, an MFBE-owner could be viewed as controlling a part-time business that operates only on evenings and/or weekends, if the MFBE-owner controls the business enterprise when it is operating.
(10)
An MFBE-owner may control a business enterprise even though one or more of the MFBE-owner's immediate family members (who themselves are not African American, Asian Pacific American, Hispanic American, or female) participate in the business enterprise as a manager, employee, owner, or in another capacity. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, OCC must make a judgment about the control the MFBE-owner exercises vis-a-vis other persons involved in the business enterprise as it does in other situations, without regard to whether or not the other persons are immediate family members.
If OCC cannot determine that the MFBE-owner, as distinct from the family as a whole, controls the business enterprise, then the MFBE-owner has failed to carry her/his burden of proof concerning control, even though s/he may participate significantly in the business enterprise's activities.

Owned or ownership. In determining whether a potential MFBE is owned by one or more African Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Hispanic Americans, or females, OCC will consider all of the facts in the record, viewed as a whole, including without limitation the following:
(1)
OCC shall deem the owner of a business enterprise to be whoever possesses at least 51 percent of the business enterprise. There may be more than one owner.
(a)

(1)
Receipt of complaint of discrimination in the bid process. The office of contract compliance shall accept complaints of alleged discrimination during the bid process regarding any participant in the bid process. Where the complaint of discrimination is specific to the procurement which is under consideration by the city, the office of contract compliance may investigate said complaint, determine its validity, and determine whether the actions complained of impact the bidder's responsiveness on the specific procurement. Allegations of discrimination based on events, incidents or occurrences which are unrelated to the specific procurement will be placed in the bidder's file maintained in the vendor relations database and handled in accordance with the procedure established in the city's vendor relations subdivision, section 2-1465, et seq.

Where the office of contract compliance investigates a complaint of discrimination that is related to the specific bid process, the details of that investigation, including findings, shall be recorded and maintained in the vendor relations database, pursuant to section 2-1471
(3)
Office of contract compliance determination of non-compliance.

Office of contract compliance determination of non-responsiveness. The covenant of non-discrimination, the outreach efforts documentation, the subcontractor project plan, and any other information required by OCC in the solicitation document pursuant to section 2-1448(b) must be completed in their entirety by each bidder and submitted with the other required bid documents in order for the bid to be considered as a responsive bid. Failure to timely submit these forms, fully completed, will result in the bid being considered as a non-responsive bid, and therefore, excluded from consideration.
(d)
OCC review of bidder submissions on eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, and eligible projects for FBEs. In addition to the review described in section 2-1448(c), the office of contract compliance will conduct additional reviews of procurements that involve eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, or eligible projects for FBEs. In reviewing the documents submitted by a bidder on eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, or eligible projects for FBEs to determine whether the bidder has satisfied the good faith efforts requirement to subcontract with AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be), the office of contract compliance will consider, among other things, the total project dollars subcontracted to or expended for services performed by other businesses, including certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs, whether such businesses perform commercially useful functions in the work of the contract based upon standard industry trade practices, whether any amounts paid to supplier businesses are for goods customarily and ordinarily used based upon standard industry trade practices, and the availability of certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) within the relevant NAICS Codes for such contract. To assist prime contractors in this effort, the office of contract compliance shall set forth in the solicitation documents for the eligible project the availability of businesses, including certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, and FBEs within the relevant NAICS Codes for such eligible project.
(1)
Database. The city will maintain a database identifying AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs, that will include the types of services provided by the business enterprise and contact information for the business enterprise. A list from the database will be made available to bidders to assist them in their efforts to meet the requirements of the equal business opportunity subcontracting program. The list prepared from the database will specify which firms the City of Atlanta has determined to be certified minority and female business enterprises, in accordance with the City of Atlanta definitions for MFBEs. This list is not exhaustive.
(2)
Minority and female business enterprise utilization. To ensure that the equal business opportunity subcontracting program achieves its purpose, the office of contract compliance will verify the AABE, APABE, HABE, or FBE certification status of each firm claiming such designation. Only certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) may be designated in reports as AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) for purposes of city projects. The percentage of AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) utilized by a bidder will be calculated by dividing the AABE, APABE, HABE, or FBE's price for providing direct labor or a bona fide service by the bidder's total dollars as identified in the bid.
(3)
Equal business opportunity program compliance, monitoring and audit. The City of Atlanta reserves the right to conduct an audit of a bidder's work on eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, or eligible projects for FBEs to confirm the bidder's compliance with this equal business opportunity subcontracting program.
(4)

The office of contract compliance shall require contractors on eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, and eligible projects for FBEs to complete and submit to OCC documentation regarding their utilization of AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be), along with all other pertinent records required by OCC.

Subdivision II. - Vendor Relations

Sec. 2-1465. - Short title.
This subdivision shall be known as the City of Atlanta's "Vendor Relations Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 12, 12-15-09)
Sec. 2-1466. - General policy.
The City of Atlanta has a need to maintain data on the performance of its vendors in order to ensure that purchases are made from, and contracts are awarded to, responsible prospective contractors only. The award of a contract to a contractor based on lowest evaluated price alone can be false economy if there is subsequent default, improper or exaggerated claims, late deliveries, or other unsatisfactory performance, resulting in additional contractual and administrative costs. While it is important that city purchases be made at the lowest price, this does not require an award to a contractor solely because that contractor submits the lowest offer. A prospective contractor must affirmatively demonstrate its responsibility, including, when necessary, the responsibility of proposed subcontractors.
The department of procurement has responsibility for making determinations of responsibility with input from the using departments and the office of contract compliance. In addition to information gathered about a bidder during the bid process, it is important that the city gather information regarding the responsibility of the contractor throughout the term of the contract, including without limitation data regarding the contractor's interactions with the city, and maintain said information in a central repository which is accessible to all city departments. It is the policy of the City of Atlanta to manage vendor relations proactively.
One aspect of responsibility is the vendor's compliance with the city's non-discrimination policy. It is the policy of the City of Atlanta not to discriminate, either directly or indirectly, against persons because of race, color, creed, religion, sex, domestic relationship status, parental status, familial status, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation, disability, age, gender identity or racial profiling. To that end, the city has the right to take any measures it deems appropriate to ensure that it is not a passive participant in public or private sector discrimination by the vendors with whom it contracts.
