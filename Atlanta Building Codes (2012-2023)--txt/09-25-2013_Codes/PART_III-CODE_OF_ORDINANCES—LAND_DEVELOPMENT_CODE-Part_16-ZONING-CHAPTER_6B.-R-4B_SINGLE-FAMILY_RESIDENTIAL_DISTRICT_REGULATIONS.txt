CHAPTER 6B. - R-4B SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 16-06B.001. - Scope of provisions.
The regulations set forth in this chapter or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter are the regulations in the R-4B Single-Family Residential District.
(Code 1977, § 16-06B.001)
Sec. 16-06B.002. - Statement of intent.
The intent of this chapter in establishing the R-4B Single-Family Residential District is as follows:
(1)
To provide opportunities for low- and moderate-income single-family dwellings that are centrally located and accessible to public transportation, jobs and social services.
(2)
To provide a specific alternative to close-in neighborhoods, now zoned for multifamily residential use, to implement a transition to a single-family residential development pattern consistent with objective (1) above.
(3)
To increase the affordability of single-family residential dwellings in close-in neighborhoods by permitting such dwellings on small lots with reduced setback requirements thus decreasing land development costs.
(4)
To provide additional opportunities for affordable in-fill single-family residential development without permitting the down-zoning of existing single-family zoned areas and thereby preserving existing neighborhoods as contemplated in the adopted comprehensive development plan.
(5)
To permit new development in a manner compatible with existing development.
(6)
To provide for the development of recreational, religious and educational facilities as basic elements of a balanced community.
