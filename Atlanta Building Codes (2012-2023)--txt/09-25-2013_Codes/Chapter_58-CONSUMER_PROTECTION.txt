Threshold loan means a loan that is secured by residential real property located within the city on which there is situated a dwelling for not more than four families or a condominium unit, or is secured by a cooperative unit within the city, if the annual percentage rate of the loan equals or exceeds by at least four percentage points but less than five percentage points the weekly average yield on United States Treasury securities with a comparable duration to the term of the loan, as of the week immediately preceding the week in which the interest rate for the loan is established, subject to the following conditions:
(1)
