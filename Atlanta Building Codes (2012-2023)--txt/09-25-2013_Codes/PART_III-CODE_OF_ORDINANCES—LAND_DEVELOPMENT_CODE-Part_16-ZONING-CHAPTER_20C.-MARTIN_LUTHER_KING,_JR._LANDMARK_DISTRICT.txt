Sec. 16-20C.001. - Statement of intent.
(1)
To preserve the environmental character and physical appearance of the area, including residential, commercial and institutional structures built from the late 19th Century to the present; to preserve the existing spatial relationships where significant; and to ensure that any new development within the Landmark District is compatible with the present architectural and spatial attributes that prevail.
(2)
To encourage the preservation of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Landmark District in such a way as to reflect and reinforce the historic neighborhood character and the unique historical relationship between the surrounding residential uses and the commercial uses, and the unique historical relationship between the commercial uses and the rest of the city.
(3)
To ensure that redevelopment and rehabilitation of the district as a whole will contribute to and enhance the particular significance of the area in which one of Atlanta's most renowned citizens, Martin Luther King, Jr., was born and grew to international prominence; and to further ensure that those individual buildings of particular significance to the life and legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. will be preserved and enhanced by all proposed development within the Landmark District.
(Code 1977, § 16-20C.001)
Sec. 16-20C.002. - Division into subareas.
(1)
The Martin Luther King, Jr. Landmark District is divided into subareas for the purpose of designating special areas of like characteristics with regulations appropriate to preservation, restoration, rehabilitation or redevelopment treatment.
a.
Auburn Avenue Residential District Subarea 1.
b.
Residential District Subarea 2.
c.
Institutional District Subarea 3.
d.
Auburn Commercial Corridor Subarea 4.
e.
Edgewood Commercial Corridor Subarea 5.
f.
Transitional zone Subarea 6.
(2)
The boundaries of the different subareas within the district are delineated on the accompanying map entitled "Martin Luther King, Jr. Landmark District."
(Code 1977, § 16-20C.002)
Sec. 16-20C.003. - General regulations.
The following regulations shall apply to the entire Landmark District inclusive of all subareas. All rehabilitation, restoration or new construction shall require a certificate of appropriateness from the Atlanta Urban Design Commission (AUDC). All proposed development shall conform to the following regulations:
(1)
Regulations shall be minimum standards which must be followed and shall be applied by the AUDC.
(2)
The AUDC shall further adopt and maintain guidelines that shall extend the intent of these regulations, further define elements of architectural style, and shall further ensure the compatibility of future developments within this HC district.
(3)
The power to hear, grant or deny variances and special exceptions from these regulations shall rest with the AUDC.
(4)
Procedure for variance: Upon a determination by the AUDC that an application for renovation or new construction is in conflict with these regulations and/or the guidelines, the AUDC shall institute procedures for public notification and public hearing as are specified similarly for the board of zoning adjustment (section 16-26.001). Notification shall including any government or nonprofit institution which has legitimate interest in the historic integrity of this Landmark District.
(5)
The compatibility rule: In general the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, scale and general character of the entire district, of each subarea, and of the immediately adjacent environment of a particular block. To further that intent and simultaneously retain flexibility, the regulations provide a "compatibility rule" which is:
The element in question (roof form, architectural trim, building setback, etc.) shall match that which predominates on that block; or where quantifiable (i.e. building height, setback, etc.), the average of all structures of like use in that block shall be adhered to. The rule shall apply as it is noted in these regulations and guidelines by reference to the "compatibility rule."
(6)
Nonconforming uses: All regulations contained in this section are to be applied to permitted uses in each subarea only. Any alteration or addition to nonconforming uses, as well as to all nonresidential uses in Subareas 1 and 2, shall be subject to design review by the AUDC.
(7)
Variance on economic hardship: The regulations contained in this section set a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to comply with other equally important objectives in the M.L. King Landmark District, such as economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of potential displacement of residents, every effort will be made to allow reasonable variance from the regulations on grounds of economic hardship to the property owner and the displacement of area residents. The burden of proof that the regulations pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner.
Variance from these regulations and additional architectural guidelines may be granted upon conditions as stipulated in section 16-20.009(7) of this part or upon the following determinations:
a.
Compliance with the Landmark regulations or guidelines would result in displacement of area residents and undermine the socio-economic character of the community. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide the AUDC with all appropriate information as to how all proposed new development will affect area residents.
b.
Compliance with these regulations would hinder rehabilitation by placing an economic hardship upon the property owner, based on his/her costs for materials and workmanship, as determined by the AUDC.
c.
In the event that the goals of items (a) and (b) above are in conflict, item (a) shall take precedence.
(8)
Secretary's guidelines: In addition to specific standards listed herein, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects Part 1 shall be a part of these regulations and shall be applied by the AUDC.
(9)
Multiple lots: Several lots combined for the purpose of a single project, in keeping with the permitted uses in this part, shall be permitted so long as the project maintains the intent and spirit of these regulations. Such a determination shall be made through the process of design review by the AUDC.
(10)
Lot divisions: The division of separate lots is subject to administrative approval provided for in the subdivision regulations of the City of Atlanta [part 15 of this Code].
(11)
Off-street parking:
a.
Off-street parking shall not be permitted in the front yard of a lot used for residential purposes.
b.
Off-street parking shall be permitted in the side and/or rear yard of a lot used for residential purposes.
c.
Carports or garages shall be permitted if detached from and located to the rear of the main residential structure. If said structure is located on a corner lot, the front yard setback for that side street shall apply to the construction of a carport or garage.
d.
Off-street parking shall not be permitted on vacant lots, except that one (1) adjacent lot owned by the resident occupant may be used to park up to two (2) owner's vehicles in operable condition provided such parking does fall within the established front, side or rear yard setback.
e.
Off-site parking, grouped or other, may be permitted through a certificate of appropriateness in Subareas 3, 4 and 5.
(12)
Demolition or moving of existing buildings:
a.
All buildings in the Landmark District shall be subject to the provisions for demolition or moving of existing structures as defined in section 16-20.007(3) of this part. However, moving a building is acceptable only as a last resort to demolition.
b.
It shall be allowable to move a structure from outside the Landmark District to a vacant site within the Landmark District if the structure is compatible in use and historic building style with surrounding structures in the district. The structure shall also reflect and reinforce the character of the historic district. The determination of compatibility shall be made along with proposed site plan review by the AUDC. Relocation shall not be considered preferable to new development, but shall be allowable upon determination by the AUDC that the proposed relocation can better serve the overall revitalization effort and general historic compatibility.
(13)
Accessory structures: The design of all accessory structures as defined by this part shall be subject to design by the AUDC.
(14)
Repealed.
(15)
Building façades, roofs, and other elements visible from the street right-of-way:
