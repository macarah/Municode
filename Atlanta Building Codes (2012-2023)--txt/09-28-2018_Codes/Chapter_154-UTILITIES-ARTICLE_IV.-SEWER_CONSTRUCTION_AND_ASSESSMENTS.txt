(Code 1977, § 9-3131)
Sec. 154-147. - Design criteria.
(a)
Generally. The requirements in this section have been prepared with an attempt to give full consideration to general conditions in the city. The requirements are established to represent the criteria upon which approval of designs will be considered and given. Any design that includes materials other than those recommended, grades less than the listed minimum and like variances from accepted practice must be supported by appropriate engineering study and approved by the commissioner.
(b)
Design period. In general, sewer systems should be designed for the estimated future tributary population to 50 years.
(c)
Materials. Materials shall be selected by reference to the city's rules and regulations. The material selected should be adapted to local conditions, special consideration being given to the character of industrial wastes, possibilities of septicity, exceptionally heavy loads, abrasion, the necessity of reducing the number of joints, soft foundations and similar problems.
(d)
Location. Sewers shall be constructed so as to be remote from public water supply wells, other water supply sources and structures. Water pipe and sanitary sewer lines shall not be laid in the same trench. A lateral separation of at least ten feet and for crossings a vertical separation of not less than 18 inches should be maintained. If this is impractical, special provisions should be made.
(e)
Interconnections. No physical connection between a potable water supply system and a sewer, sewage treatment plant or appurtenances thereto which might permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable water supply shall be permitted.
(f)
Sizes, slopes, depths and velocity of flow.
(1)
Size. The minimum allowable size for any sanitary sewer governed by this article other than house sewer connections shall be eight inches in diameter.
(2)
Slopes. All sewers should be designed and constructed with hydraulic slopes sufficient to give mean velocities, when flowing half full, of not less than 2.5 feet per second, based on Manning's formula. Sewer velocities should be determined using coefficients of friction ("n") appropriate for the pipe material specified.
(3)
Increasing size. At manholes where the sewer is increased in size or at points where a smaller sewer connects into a larger sewer, the crown elevations of the pipes shall be notched at a minimum to maintain the same energy gradient.
(4)
Alignment. Sewers up to and including 30-inch diameter must be laid with uniform slope and alignment between manholes. On larger sizes, horizontal curves may be permitted.
(g)
Basis of design.
(1)
Generally. The design analysis to determine the required capacities of sanitary sewers will consider the following factors: maximum hourly quantity of domestic sewage and industrial wastes and groundwater infiltration or the 50-year design period.
(2)
New systems. New sewer systems will be designed on the basis of an average per capita daily flow of not less than 100 gallons of sewage. On this basis the lateral sewers will be designed with capacities when running full of not less than four times the average flow. Trunk and outfall sewers must have an appropriate peak factor under the same conditions of not less than 2.5 times the average flow. Special allowance should be made in each case for sewage or water from industrial plants.
(h)
Manholes.
(1)
Location. Manholes shall be installed at the end of each eight-inch or larger sanitary sewer, at every change in grade, except as indicated in subsection (f)(4) of this section, change in size or alignment, at all intersections and at distances not greater than 400 feet for sewers of 15 inches in diameter or less and 500 feet for sewers 18 inches to 30 inches. Greater spacing may be permitted in larger sewers and those carrying treated effluents with approval of the commissioner.
(2)
Drop manholes. Inside drop manholes are permitted for drops of up to four vertical feet for eight-inch through 12-inch diameter pipe where special filleted inverts with reinforced concrete bottom are provided. For drops greater than four feet, city standard outside drop manholes shall be used. All manholes will have a shaped rowlock, brick invert or an alternative invert if approved by the commissioner. Standard manhole sections will be used if the elevation difference between the manhole invert and the incoming sewer invert is less than 36 inches, in which case the invert will be filleted to create a channel which will prevent solids depositing in the manhole.
(3)
Diameter. See applicable standards.
(4)
Materials and watertightness. Manholes will be constructed to city standards and will be waterproofed where groundwater conditions are unfavorable. Special manhole covers are required to prevent flooding, when ordered by the commissioner. Manholes will have city standard castings and steps throughout.
(5)
Flow channel. The manhole floor shall have a flow channel made to conform in shape and carrying capacity to that of the sewers, as indicated on the applicable standard section.
(6)
Top elevation. Top elevation will conform to street grade and slope. Manholes outside the paved roadway shall be three feet higher than the ground elevation unless otherwise permitted by the commissioner. The developer is responsible for any final adjustment.
(i)
Inverted siphons. Inverted siphons will have at least two barrels with minimum pipe size of six inches. Necessary flushing and maintenance appurtenances will be provided. The manholes will have adequate clearances for rodding, and the inlet and outlet details must be arranged so that normal flow is diverted to one barrel and so that either barrel may be taken out of service for cleaning. In general, sufficient head should be provided and pipe sizes selected to secure velocities of at least three feet per second at average flows. Siphons will be used only when approved by the commissioner.
(j)
Force mains. Force mains will be allowed only with the permission of the commissioner. Installation, design and material specifications shall be approved by the commissioner.
(k)
Depth.
(1)
Sanitary sewers shall be located with a minimum of three feet of cover in areas not subject to vehicular traffic and a minimum of six feet of cover under areas designated for vehicular traffic. Specific exceptions to this subsection may be made where special material or bedding is provided.
(2)
Documentation of soil compaction tests meeting city standards shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval.
(l)
House connections.
(1)
House connections in new developments will be extended one joint (three feet) beyond the property side of the sidewalks at a location selected to best serve each property. A city standard cleanout shall be provided at the property line. All house connection extensions will be properly sealed prior to backfilling.
(2)
The house connections where provided shall be accurately located in the field by the owner's engineer, who shall submit an acceptable plat in two copies indicating the location, along with an affidavit by the owner's engineer confirming such locations.
(3)
Prior to the use of any house connection provided in the metropolitan sewer system, all provisions of the city's plumbing code shall be met.

The owner shall make all necessary repairs or do work necessary for the maintenance of the sewer within 48 hours after notice of the necessity therefor is given by the commissioner.
(b)
Authority of city. If the work is not done within the time allowed, the commissioner shall make such repairs as may be necessary to protect the city's sewer system from any damage and shall charge the cost thereof to the property owner. Further, the city may recover fines resulting from spillages pursuant to state law.
(c)
Effect of nonpayment by owner. When the owner fails or refuses to pay the cost of those repairs, as required by subsection (b) of this section, the commissioner shall give the owner notice of a hearing in regard to cutting off the owner's water connection to the city water system, if it is connected with the city's water system.
