(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-201. - Purpose and scope of exemption.
It has been found by the city council that the availability of smoke-free restaurants within the city should be encouraged. There is large body of scientific research which documents the deleterious effects on the health of non-smokers who are in close proximity to smoke from cigarettes and other tobacco products. The council believes that measures which increase the number of smoke-free restaurants will offer health benefits to its citizens and visitors and not cause any appreciable amount of negative economic consequences to the city or its businesses. The council wishes to encourage restaurants to make smoke-free dining available to citizens and is therefore offering an exemption from a portion of the business and occupation tax to those restaurants which meet the criteria of this division for the purpose of demonstrating the economic viability of smoke-free restaurants.
The State of Georgia recognizes that municipalities desire to encourage or support such goals and in section 48-13-10(f) of the Official Code of Georgia provides specific authority allowing local governments to provide an exemption from business or occupation taxes for the purpose of developing, attracting, encouraging or maintaining selected types of businesses. In order to encourage restaurants to provide smoke free dining opportunities in those areas of the city where such opportunities are not presently available or are underserved by smoke-free restaurants, an exemption from the city business or occupation tax is herein provided as permitted by state law.
The following exemption from the business tax levied in this article III, division 1 is for the purpose of promoting development of smoke-free restaurants and is not for regulatory purposes. The exemption only applies to those businesses and occupations that are taxed pursuant to section 30-51 through 30-85 by the local government pursuant to the pertinent general and/or local law and ordinance and no other effect on any other code section is intended.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-202. - Effect of division upon outstanding occupation taxes.
The outstanding liabilities under prior application of any ordinances shall continue and remain in force until such tax, fee, or assessment, including any penalties and interest, shall be fully paid.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-203. - Administration.
The chief financial officer and the director of the bureau of buildings shall administer and enforce this division for the purpose of determining the applicability of the exemption provided herein and for the enforcement of penalties herein imposed.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-204. - Exemption provided.
In accordance with state law, an exemption is hereby provided from the business tax levied by section 30-51 through 30-85 for those restaurants eligible under the terms set forth in this division. Said exemption is to apply only to specific restaurant locations qualified for an exemption under this division and no exemption is provided for any other business location operated by the same person, unless said location separately qualifies under the terms of this division.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)

(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-206. - Application and approval required.
(a)
Any restaurant desiring an exemption under this division must make application to the business tax division on a form provided by the department of finance. The exemption must be approved in writing before any restaurant seeking an exemption under this division may apply the exemption to its present year tax liability. Any person who operates a qualifying restaurant in full compliance with this article and who properly registers and is approved and certified as qualifying for exemption from business taxes for that restaurant for the current tax year prior to the due date for business taxes may apply the exemption to their tax liability for the current tax year. All persons operating any restaurant location that has applied for but has not received approval for exemption prior to the due date for business taxes for the current tax year may not apply an exemption to their tax liability. The exemption shall be prorated from the date of application in the first year of qualification.
(b)
Any person desiring to qualify a particular restaurant location, which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages, for an exemption pursuant to this division must receive written confirmation from the city police department that the location is designated as a restaurant as defined herein and must make application to and receive approval from the business tax division.
(c)
Any person desiring to qualify a particular restaurant location for the exemption made available by this division and who is required by any other applicable section of the City Code to file any business tax return, must timely file such other business tax returns in order to qualify for the exemption available pursuant to this division. Failure to file a business tax return when required to do so by any other applicable section of the City Code shall be grounds for denial of the exemption provided in this division.
(d)
Any person, who applies for an exemption for a location which fails to qualify under the term of this division, shall be responsible for the full payment of all business taxes for that location in addition to any penalties and interest as provided elsewhere in this article.
(e)
Each person who receives an exemption shall be provided with a list of the specific signage requirements which may be set forth by the administrative rules of the bureau of buildings. Upon making any change to the signage requirements, the bureau of buildings shall notify the holders of exemptions of the required signage.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-207. - Exemption rate structure.
(a)
Any restaurant certified as qualifying as smoke-free restaurant classification shall be exempt from 20 percent of the business tax which would otherwise be due. In the year when the first application for the exemption is made, the exemption shall be prorated from the date of application.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-208. - Duration of registration for exemption.
Once qualification for exemption pursuant to this division is approved, such qualification shall automatically expire unless renewed as a part of the current year registration.

Sec. 30-209. - Types of restaurants ineligible.
(a)
the following types of businesses are not eligible for the smoke-free restaurant exemption:
(1)
Adult businesses as defined in City Code section 16-29.001(3) or as amended;
(2)
Any establishment which has a license for the sale of distilled spirits and which is not qualified as a restaurant by the end of its first 12 months of operation.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-210. - Notice of non-compliance sent to owner for failure to enforce designated non-smoking areas.
Because the granting of an exemption under this section is a privilege which is subject to abuse solely for economic gain, the city recognizes that there must be a mechanism to monitor compliance by those restaurants that have chosen to apply for tax exemptions under the terms of this division. The city believes that those who receive the exemption have a duty to request compliance from its patrons, and for the failure of restaurants granted exemption to comply with the non smoking designations required by this division will result in a notice of non-compliance letter being issued to the owner by the bureau of buildings and being kept on file by the bureau of treasury, licensing and employee benefits. The notice of violation is an administrative notice and is not an ordinance violation. The receipt of a notice of non-compliance letter shall not require appearance in municipal court.
(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-211. - Loss of eligibility.
Any restaurant which has qualified under this division for an exemption from the business tax shall lose its eligibility upon the happening of any of the following events:

The loss of restaurant status as determined by its license status;
(2)

(3)
A conviction for any violation related to the use of the provisions of this division for the purpose of evading business taxes which would otherwise be due and payable at the location for which the exemption was issued;

(Ord. No. 2000-55, § 1, 10-10-00)
Sec. 30-214. - Separate restaurants locations.
Where a restaurant is operated at more than one location, each location must apply for exemption. The person operating such restaurants shall pay business taxes in accordance with the prevailing taxing method and tax rate at each location.
