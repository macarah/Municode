PD-OC Districts may hereafter be established in accordance with the general procedures and requirements set forth in chapter 19 above.

It is the intent of these regulations to provide for development of such districts at locations appropriate in terms of the comprehensive development plan and the transportation facilities plan, and in close proximity to mass transit facilities, in accord with standards set forth herein.
It is further intended that PD-OC development shall be in complexes within which mutually supporting commercial and office uses are scaled, balanced and located so as to reduce general traffic congestion and where convenient pedestrian circulation systems and mass transit facilities further reduced the need for private automobiles.
Within such districts, it is intended that uses shall be so arranged horizontally or vertically:

That any residential uses shall be so separated from major vehicular traffic flows and other disquieting influences as to protect privacy and tranquility; and
(2)
That general commercial and service uses shall be concentrated for maximum pedestrian convenience and located for easy accessibility for residents of the area, workers within the district and visitors.
Where such districts adjoin residential neighborhoods, it is intended that arrangement of buildings, uses, open space and vehicular access be such as to provide appropriate transition and reduce potential adverse effects.
