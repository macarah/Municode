CHAPTER 18I. - SPI-9 BUCKHEAD VILLAGE DISTRICT REGULATIONS[6]

Sec. 16-18I.001. - Scope of provisions.
The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are the regulations in the SPI-9 Buckhead Village Special Public Interest District. These regulations shall supplant existing districts or portions of existing districts as shown on the attached map referenced in section 16-18I.003; further provided however that:
1.
Any zoning or special use permit conditions associated with the previous zoning for any parcel within the SPI-9 District shall continue in full force and effect. Such conditions shall be incorporated as a condition of the SPI-9 zoning for such parcels. Where the SPI-9 regulations impose no standard or impose a less strict standard than that set forth in any condition incorporated from a previous zoning, the SPI-9 zoning shall not be construed to have removed such condition; and
2.
All existing categories of historic protection designated pursuant to Chapter 20 of Part 16 shall continue in full force and effect and said existing historic protection regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, the regulations set forth in this chapter. Whenever the following regulations are at variance with said existing historic protection regulations, the historic protection regulations shall prevail.
(Ord. No. 2010-54(10-O-1339), § 1(Att. A), 10-13-10)
Sec. 16-18I.002. - Statement of intent.
The intent of the council in establishing the SPI-9 Buckhead Village Special Public Interest District is as follows:
1.
To encourage the redevelopment of properties within the Buckhead Village consistent with the community vision established in the City of Atlanta Comprehensive Development Plan, the 1999 Vision for the Buckhead Village, the 2001 Buckhead LCI Plan, 2005 Buckhead Village Parking & Circulation Study, and the 2007 Piedmont Area Transportation Plan;
2.
To provide for a balanced mix of office, retail, commercial, residential and related uses within the SPI-9 District so as to serve the needs of the Buckhead community, surrounding residential neighborhoods, and specialty shoppers and visitors;
3.
To provide for appropriate transitions from the high intensity areas along Peachtree Road to the mixed-use character of the surrounding village areas and the lower density residential neighborhoods that border the district and to prevent incompatible commercial uses and parking in residential neighborhoods;
4.
To implement the community vision through the provision of specific graphic standards to provide a pleasing, cohesive urban aesthetic for the district through vibrant, quality design;
5.
To ensure the safe and convenient movement of pedestrians within Buckhead Village through the provision of adequate and accommodating streetscapes and to reduce pedestrian and vehicular conflicts by providing clear delineated streetscapes for pedestrian movement;
6.
To reduce auto dependency and create opportunities for increasing the use of alternative transportation modes thereby mitigating traffic congestion, noise, and other negative impacts that detract from the village and surrounding neighborhoods;
7.
To increase connectivity for all transportation modes within the district and between the district and other areas;
8.
To provide a cooperative means for meeting parking needs within the village;
9.
To create incentives for the provision of public facilities and functional, publicly-accessible open spaces;
10.
To encourage and implement environmentally-responsible development;
11.
To provide a range of housing types to meet varying housing needs; and
12.
To make more predictable, streamline, and expedite the permitting process for developments meeting the intent and requirements of the district regulations.

(Ord. No. 2010-54(10-O-1339), § 1(Att. A), 10-13-10)
Sec. 16-18I.005. - Application procedures and permits.
1.
Special administrative permit (SAP) application:
a.
An SAP application and a specified number of copies each of a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the office of planning prior to an applicant filing for a building permit. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), modifications of outdoor dining, or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that alters the configuration of openings at sidewalk-level, shall be subject to said SAP approval.
b.
An applicant shall arrange a conference to discuss the application and the requirements of this chapter with the director or their designee either prior or subsequent to SAP submittal provided that such meeting shall be held within 14 days of the date of the request by the applicant, unless a longer period is mutually agreed upon. All SAP applications shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to SAP applications contained in section 16-25 except as otherwise modified by this Chapter 18I.
c.
Where regulations require the approval of an SAP for purposes other than those so specified, processing by the director of the office of planning or the director's designee shall include consideration of other special administrative permits, without additional application. Where regulations require variance, special exception, rezoning, or special use permit action, the SAP for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for such action.
2.
Reserved.
3.
Administrative variations: As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the director of the office of planning or the director's designee may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings, to be filed as a public record, that either:
a.
A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accordance with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent of such regulations, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree than strict enforcement of such regulations would provide; or
b.
In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at that time or in the future.
4.
Variances and special exceptions: Administrative variations shall not be authorized to be granted for any of the following requirements, whereas instead, such relief shall only be authorized by action of the board of zoning adjustment (BZA):
a.
A reduction of required transitional height planes or transitional yards where the boundaries of SPI-9 adjoin any residential district outside of SPI-9 without an intervening street;
b.
A reduction of open space requirements as specified in these SPI-9 regulations;
c.
A reduction of public access or public spaces as specified in these SPI-9 regulations; and
d.
An increase of the maximum height as specified in these SPI-9 regulations.
5.
Floor area ratio and the application of bonuses. The FAR for each parcel within SPI-9 shall be as depicted on Map Attachment A except where modified by any zoning or special use permit condition. Where the Official Zoning Map would allow FAR different than the FAR shown on Map Attachment A, the FAR shown on Map Attachment A shall control provided, however, that Map Attachment A shall not control any zoning or special use permit condition. The FAR allowed in SPI-9 may be increased by the application of bonuses as set forth in these regulations provided, however, that amendments to the Official Zoning Map allowing a parcel additional FAR above the existing FAR for that parcel by the application of such bonuses shall be made in as set forth in section 16-27.001 et seq. for a change in condition of zoning with the following modifications:
a.
The application shall include calculations showing the current permitted FAR and the proposed FAR and the type of bonus which is to be applied to increase the FAR to the proposed level;
b.
The impact analysis for the proposed increase in FAR by this change of condition with respect to each of the matters enumerated in section 1627.004 shall discuss the effect of the increased FAR rather than the impact which would be associated with proposed change in a zoning classification; and
c.
The public notice issued pursuant to 16-27.007 shall include existing FAR, proposed FAR, the proposed maximum allowable FAR and the type of bonus which is to be applied to allow the increase of FAR to the proposed level.
(Ord. No. 2010-54(10-O-1339), § 1(Att. A), 10-13-10; Ord. No. 2018-11(18-O-1023), § 9.C, 5-16-18 )
