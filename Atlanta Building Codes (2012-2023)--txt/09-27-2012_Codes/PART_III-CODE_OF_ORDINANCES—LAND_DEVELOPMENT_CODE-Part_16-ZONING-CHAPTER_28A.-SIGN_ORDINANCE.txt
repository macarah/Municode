Sec. 16-28A.003. - Findings, purpose and intent.
The City of Atlanta finds that the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city directly affect the public health, safety, and welfare. The city finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and do not relate to the premises on which they are located, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the City of Atlanta in enacting this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Atlanta, and to implement the policies and objectives of the comprehensive development plan of the City of Atlanta through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the City of Atlanta.
(2)
To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the City of Atlanta in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians.
(3)
To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed.
(4)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts.
(5)
To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interests of the city.
(6)
To maintain and maximize tree coverage within the city.
(7)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations which effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city.
(8)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses which are located within the City of Atlanta, and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods or services which are available upon site so as to promote the economic vitality of businesses which are located within the City of Atlanta.
(9)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State and United States Constitutions within the City of Atlanta.
(10)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts.
(11)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits.
(12)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances.
(13)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs.
(14)
To continue to encourage the display of public art as a vital part of the urban landscape, while imposing reasonable restrictions on such art in order to protect public safety and to avoid the abuse of a public art exemption as a means for evading the purpose and effect of these sign regulations through works with a commercial theme or message.
(15)
To prohibit all signs not expressly authorized by this chapter, to provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

(Code 1977, ยง 16-28A.005)
Sec. 16-28A.006. - Computations.
(a)
Area of Sign Face and Distance Between Signs: All regulations involving the area of signs specified in this chapter 28A shall be interpreted to mean measurements of the sign face unless the context, text or usage clearly requires otherwise. All regulations involving distances from or between signs specified in this chapter 28A shall be interpreted to refer to any part of a sign, including both the sign structure and the sign face.
(b)
Computation of Sign Area of Individual Signs: The area of a sign shall be the total area within the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with the total area of any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the regulations of part 16 of the code of ordinances and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(c)
Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs: Where the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less, only one (1) display face shall be measured in computing sign area. If the two (2) faces of a double-face sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be the area of the larger sign face. In all other cases, the areas of all sign faces of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign.
(d)
Computation of Height of Sign: The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction, or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.

No sign shall be erected, and there shall be no lighting of signs or premises in such a manner and location so as to obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic signal, notice or control device, or with lights on any emergency vehicle, or so to create hazards or distractions to drivers because of direct or reflected natural or artificial light, flashing, intermittent or flickering lighting or real or apparent movement.
(iii)
No flashing or animated sign shall extend over a public right-of-way.
(iv)
If any sign is found to constitute a traffic hazard, the owner of the sign may be required to reduce the intensity of the condition or effect which caused the hazard to a level acceptable to the bureau of traffic and transportation. The director may through the issuance of a stop work order cause an immediate cessation of such conditions or effects where an imminent danger to the traveling public is found.
(i)
Sign Lighting: Any sign erected subsequent to the effective date of this amendment shall, if externally lighted, be lighted from the top and the lighting shall be directed downward onto the sign. Lighting associated with a sign shall be directed at the sign face. All sources of light associated with a sign shall be effectively shielded from adjacent residential districts and streets.

In R-1 through R-G districts, no such sign shall exceed six square feet in surface area or be placed closer than ten feet to the street paving or the edge of the graded street surface nearest the property depending on the manner of the street improvement, but in no event within the right-of-way of any public street or way.

Such signs may also provide identification, but shall bear no advertising matter. All such signs shall conform with all of the provisions of the Georgia Real Estate Brokers and Salesmen Licensing Act of 1973, as amended.
(k)
Misleading Real Estate Signs Prohibited: The display on any property of any sign, poster, billboard or other advertising device bearing the name of any real estate firm, broker, associate broker, or salesperson shall create a rebuttable presumption that the person or other legal entity (if a corporation, the president or chief executive thereof) whose name so appears on said sign directly caused the sign to be placed. No sign advertising the property on which it is located for sale, rent or lease shall in any manner convey or create the impression that such property may be used for any purpose for which it is not zoned or that any building may be used for purposes not permitted by this part 16 or any other provision of the code of ordinances of the City of Atlanta.

Regulations for Changing Signs and Signs Employing Changing Sign Technology.
(1)
Each message displayed on any changing sign display shall remain static for at least ten seconds following the completion of its transition from the previous message. As used in this subsection "static" shall mean a display that is fixed in one position with no portion of the display being in motion or changing in color or light intensity.
(2)
When a message is changed mechanically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in three seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between any movement of any part of the display of the previous message and the time that the display of the next message is fully static.
(3)
When a message is changed electronically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in two seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between the time that the previous message is static and fully illuminated and the next message is static and fully illuminated.
(4)
No changing sign may include animated, flashing, full-motion video or other intermittent elements. The transition period between two fully illuminated static messages displays in an electronically changed sign shall not be considered an intermittent element so long as the purpose of the changing light intensity is to fade or dissolve into the next message.
(5)
No changing sign may have any type of changing effect on the border of the sign that is not fully integrated with a static message display and which does not transition to the next static message display in the same manner as the rest of the display.
(6)
No display or other effect from any electronically changed sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Such display or effect shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter.
(7)
An electronically changed sign which uses the scrolling of letters, numbers or symbols onto the sign face to form words or messages shall be allowed to appear on the sign face from only one direction for each static display. Messages transitions achieved by means of the scrolling of the letters, numbers or symbols shall be completed within two seconds and shall remain static for at least ten seconds following the completion of the transition from the previous message.
(8)
All signs shall appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change so that the brightness of the display does not cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. The failure of an electronically changed sign to appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter.
(9)
No malfunction of a changing sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Any such condition resulting from a malfunction shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter.
(10)

The distances shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest edges of the signs. Any application to employ changing sign technology on a general advertising sign which had been submitted to the director prior to the passage of this ordinance and which remains legally eligible for consideration after the passage of this ordinance shall not be subject to this distance requirement.
(11)
No general advertising sign employing changing sign technology which is adjacent to an arterial or connector street or with a message face that is visible from an arterial or connector street shall be located within 2,500 feet of another general advertising sign employing changing sign technology that is on the same side of arterial or connector street or with a sign face that is visible to traffic traveling in the same direction on said arterial or connector street, as measured in a straight line from the nearest edges of the signs. Any application to employ changing sign technology on a general advertising sign which had been submitted to the director prior to the passage of this ordinance and which remains legally eligible for consideration after the passage of this ordinance shall not be subject to this distance requirement.
(12)
A business identification sign which is not permitted to be a changing sign and employing any changing sign technology shall contain only static messages and shall not be allowed to change more than once every 24 hours. Any change of copy shall require a permit.
(13)
A freestanding sign which is not permitted to be a changing sign and employing any changing sign technology shall contain only static messages and shall not be allowed to change more than once every 24 hours. Any change of copy shall require a permit.
(14)
Any building which is allowed to have a building signature sign employing any changing sign technology may not change the sign more frequently than once every 24 hours and all building signature signs on all sides of the building shall display an identical message which meets the definition of a building signature sign. Any change of copy shall require a permit.
(15)
Shopping center signs may employ changing sign technology in those districts where changing signs are allowed. The portion of the sign face which is capable of employing changing sign technology shall be limited to 50 percent or less of the total area of the sign face.
(16)
Permit applications for electronically changed signs must also include a certification from the owner or operator of the sign stating that the sign shall at all times be operated in accordance with this part and that the owner or operator shall provide proof of such conformance upon request of the director. Whether the sign is programmed from the site or from a remote location, the computer interface or other method that programs or controls the changing of the sign shall be available for inspection upon request of the director so that the director can determine the messages being displayed. If the information from the computer interface or other control method is not immediately available, the sign shall cease operation until such access can be provided.
(17)
Any general advertising sign which applies to employ changing sign technology shall be required to include as a part of its application, a statement which shall indicate whether the applicant is willing to allow law enforcement agencies to utilize its display capabilities to disseminate emergency messages.
(18)
Any changing sign currently in existence shall comply with the regulations of this part. If a changing sign currently in existence cannot meet these requirements due to the limitations of the technology being employed, the owner of the sign shall be allowed to continue the existing use upon a showing, satisfactory to the director, that the requirements of this part cannot be met.
(19)
Large Screen Video Display signs which are permitted in SPI-1 shall be regulated by the specific provisions applicable to that type of sign.
(20)
Due to the limitation on distances between certain electronic changing signs, an approved application to employ changing sign technology must be acted upon within the time frames stated on the sign permit. After expiration of the permit, a new application for the location shall be required and the expired permit shall be not be considered to bar location of other changing signs due to distance requirements under this part. The director may issue one extension of 60 days for good cause as shown in writing by the permit holder.

Sec. 16-28A.013. - Procedures.
(a)
Sign Permits:
(i)
No sign shall be placed, constructed, erected or modified without first securing a sign permit from the director in accordance with these procedures, except for those signs exempted by the specific language of this chapter 28A.
(ii)
No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or proposed sign unless such sign meets all of the requirements of this chapter, part 16 of the code of ordinances, and all other applicable requirements of the Code of Ordinances or is a lawful nonconforming sign under this chapter.
(iii)
No permit shall be required for a change of copy or message or for the substitution of panels or faces, on a lawful general advertising sign.
(iv)
Any change of copy or message on a business identification sign shall require a permit.
(v)
Any change of copy or message on a shopping center sign shall require a permit.
(vi)
Any change of copy or message on a building signature sign shall require a permit.
(vii)
Where permits are required to change sign copy or message on a sign containing a lawful commercial message, the purpose of the permit is to document that the sign copy or message meets the requirements for a building signature sign or is being used to direct attention to a business, profession, product, service, accommodation, activity or entertainment conducted, sold or offered on the premises on which the sign is located, and which: (i) is used only by an entity that possesses a valid City of Atlanta business license authorizing that entity to operate on said premises, unless said entity is exempt from business licensing requirements; and (ii) is used only by an entity that actually occupies said premises. Provided, however, that said sign copy or message may also direct attention to said on-premise entity's bona fide business affiliates, sponsorships, joint service relationships, or similar business alliances, so long as said references are displayed in conjunction with, and directly promote the business, profession, product, service, accommodation, activity or entertainment conducted, sold or offered on the premises.
(viii)
Although any sign allowed in this part may contain, in lieu of any other message or copy, any lawful noncommercial message, a permit shall be required for such signs to verify that the sign is structurally sound, is at a location, and is of a size, which meets the requirements for a lawful sign under this part. The review of the sign copy or message is solely for the purpose of determining whether the lawful noncommercial message is intended to be used for the purpose of directing attention to a business operated for profit, or to a product, commodity or service for sale or lease, or to any other commercial interest or activity in a manner that may be otherwise regulated.
(ix)
Permits for a change of copy for business identification signs, shopping center signs and building signature signs as required by this part may authorize multiple versions of the copy to be displayed provided however, that this permit shall not authorize a more frequent change of copy than is allowed under these regulations.
(x)
No permit will be issued for any change to a legally nonconforming sign that enlarges or expands the degree of nonconformity, provided however that repairs and normal maintenance of legally non-conforming signs including the repairs and maintenance necessary to allow conversion of the sign face for the utilization of changing sign technology shall not be considered an expansion of the degree of non-conformity. An existing changing sign that is legally non-conforming shall be allowed to utilize this provision for purpose of installing a different changing sign technology.
(b)
Permit Procedures: The following procedures shall govern the application for and issuance of all sign permits under this chapter 28A.
(1)
All applications for sign permits shall be submitted to the director on an application form provided by the director. Each application shall be accompanied by the applicable fees established by the governing authority from time to time. No application shall be deemed to be accepted by the director unless all fees are paid and all information reasonably required by the director is provided by the applicant. All applications for construction, creation or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by detailed drawings showing the dimensions, design, structure, and location of each particular sign, as well as total wall area dimensions when necessary to determine compliance with this chapter 28A. One (1) application and permit may include multiple signs on the same lot where said multiple signs are otherwise permissible by this chapter 28A.
(2)
All applications for sign permits shall be either issued or denied within thirty (30) days of their submission. If the sign permit is neither issued nor denied within this time period, the applicant may at their own risk erect a sign meeting the requirements of this part as if the application had been granted. The director is authorized, however, upon determination that a sign, erected for any reason, is not in compliance with these regulations, to take the appropriate action necessary to cause it to come into compliance or to be removed if illegal. After examination of an application, including an application which has been filed for more than thirty (30) days, the director shall either:
(a)
Issue the sign permit if the sign(s) conform(s) in all respects to the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable city code provisions; or
(b)
Deny the sign permit if the sign(s) fail(s) in any way to conform to the requirements of this chapter or any other applicable City Code provision. In case of a denial, the director shall notify the applicant in writing at the address set forth in the application.
(3)
No illegal display, feature, attribute or other part of any otherwise permitted sign shall be considered legally non-conforming and no illegal sign shall become legally non-conforming by reason of failure of the director to deny the permit within thirty (30) days of the submission of the application.
(c)
Inspections: The director shall, at any time deemed necessary, inspect each sign regulated by this chapter 28A to ensure conformity with these regulations and other ordinances of the city. The director is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke any permit issued upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with any provision of this chapter 28A or other ordinances of the city, or to take other action lawful and necessary to assure correction of violations.
(d)
Lapse of Sign Permit: A sign permit shall be deemed to lapse automatically and hence be deemed illegal if the business license for the premises lapses, is revoked or is not renewed. A sign permit shall also lapse if the business activity on the premises is discontinued for a period of 180 days or more and is not renewed within 30 days of a notice to the last permittee, sent to the premises, that the sign permit will lapse if such activity is not renewed.
(e)
Permits for Temporary Signs: Temporary signs shall be allowed only in accordance with the provisions of section 16-28A.007(a) and only upon the issuance of a temporary sign permit, which shall be subject to the following additional requirements:
(1)
A temporary sign permit shall allow the use of a temporary sign only for one single continuous specified 30-day period.
(2)
Only one temporary sign permit shall be issued to the same business license holder on the same lot for the same business.
(3)
A temporary sign shall be allowed only in the districts specified in section 16-28A.010 and shall be subject to all other requirements for temporary signs as set forth in this chapter, in part 16, and in any other applicable code section.

Nonconforming Sign Regulations:
(1)
A nonconforming sign may remain in use subject to the requirements of chapter 24 of part 16, and the following requirements, as well as any other applicable requirements of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Atlanta. Said nonconforming sign shall be deemed to be "structures and premises in combination" for purposes of regulation under chapter 24 of part 16.
(2)
Any nonconforming sign which is not used or leased for a continuous period of one (1) year shall not be reused for sign purposes unless and until it fully conforms with the terms ad requirements of this chapter 28A.
(3)
Change of copy or message or the substitution of panels or faces on nonconforming signs and repainting, refacing or repostering nonconforming sign shall be permitted to the extent authorized by section 16-28A.013 and chapter 24 of part 16. Repairs and normal maintenance of nonconforming signs, such as repainting, electrical repairs, and neon tubing repairs, shall be permitted, to the extent authorized by this chapter 28A, and chapter 24 of part 16, provided it does not enlarge or expand the degree of nonconformity.
(c)
Registration of Nonconforming General Advertising Signs:
(1)
The city finds that nonconforming general advertising signs may adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. Such signs may adversely affect the aesthetic characteristics of the city and may adversely affect public safety due to the visual impact of said signs on motorists and the structural characteristics of said signs. Accordingly, the following registration requirements are found to be necessary in order to minimize these possible adverse effects through yearly inspections and maintenance and allow the city to remain cognizant of the locations and maintenance of said signs.
(2)
The owner(s) or authorized agent(s) of each nonconforming general advertising sign located within the City of Atlanta shall register said nonconforming sign with the director of the bureau of buildings no later than six months after the effective date of this chapter and shall renew this registration annually. Any nonconforming general advertising sign that does not comply with the registration requirements herein shall be deemed to be an illegal sign and shall be subject to the regulations applicable to illegal signs and all other enforcement provisions specified in section 16-28A.015. The director shall promulgate a form for the registration of said nonconforming general advertising signs and shall annually inspect said signs to assure that they continue in all other respects in conformity with all other provisions of this part and any other applicable ordinance or regulation of the City of Atlanta. The fee for initial registration shall be $50.00. The fee for each subsequent renewal shall be $25.00. These fees represent those costs associated with the administrative compliance with these requirements and shall be used to offset those costs.

Any person damaging any tree in violation of section 16-28A.007(n) of this chapter shall, in addition to other penalties imposed by this part, be required to replace any such tree with a healthy tree or trees of like caliper and species, if, in the judgment of the city arborist, such tree is permanently injured or impaired or in danger of dying as a result of such damage.
(Code 1977, ยง 16-28A.015)
