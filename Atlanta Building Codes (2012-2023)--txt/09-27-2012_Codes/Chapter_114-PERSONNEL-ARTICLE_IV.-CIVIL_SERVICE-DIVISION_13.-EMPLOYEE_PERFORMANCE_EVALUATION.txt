DIVISION 13. - EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Sec. 114-396. - Objective.
The commissioner of human resources shall prepare a system for evaluating the work performance of all employees in the civil service. Such employee performance evaluation shall be used primarily to inform employees as to the status of their work performance and as to methods of improving such performance. The performance evaluation shall be used in determining the annual increase. The performance evaluation may also be used as a basis for training, promotion, demotion, transfer or dismissal and for such other purposes as set forth in this article.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-397. - Period of evaluation.
All classified employees shall be evaluated prior to the expiration of a six-month interval following an original appointment or promotion. All classified and unclassified employees shall be evaluated annually and upon separation from service.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-398. - Evaluation.
Evaluations shall be prepared by the immediate supervisor of each employee and reviewed by the appropriate appointing authority. A supervisory employee who is leaving a position shall be required to submit performance evaluation forms on all of the employees under such supervisor's supervision who have not been evaluated within the previous six-month period.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-399. - Review with employee.
The evaluator shall discuss each performance evaluation with the employee being evaluated and provide the employee with an official copy. The appointing authority shall establish an internal procedure to review the evaluation of any employee who disagrees with the performance evaluation rating. The appointing authority shall be the final authority in resolving disagreements. In the event the appointing authority and the evaluator are one and the same, the final authority for resolving disagreements rests with the chief operating officer.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-400. - Confidentiality.
Performance evaluations shall be confidential and shall be available only to the employee evaluated, the supervisors in the employee's chain of command, the appointing authority or designee, the commissioner of human resources and to the mayor upon request and when requested under the Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. 50-18-70 through 50-18-76. Evaluations of employees of the city council shall be confidential and available to the supervisor of those employees, the commissioner of human resources and to members of the city council. All performance evaluation forms shall be signed by the employee and the immediate supervisor and reviewed by the appointing authority or designee.
The employee's signature will not be interpreted as an agreement with the evaluation but rather, that the employee has reviewed and discussed the performance evaluation with the immediate supervisor.
Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit performance evaluations, where relevant, from being used as evidence in civil service board proceedings or in other legal proceedings.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-401. - Changes in evaluation.
If for any reason a department head shall request an alteration of the performance evaluation form after it has been officially submitted to the commissioner of human resources, such request shall be made in writing and shall set forth fully the reasons for the request. The request shall become part of the official performance evaluation. Any changes in evaluation shall be discussed with the employee being evaluated, and such employee shall have the right of review and appeal, the same as with the original evaluation.
