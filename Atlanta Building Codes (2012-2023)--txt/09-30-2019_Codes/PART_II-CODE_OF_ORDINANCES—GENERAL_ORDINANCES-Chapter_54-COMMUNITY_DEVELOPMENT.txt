(d)
Affordable housing impact statements shall include a quantitative, or numeric section, that shall provide numeric estimates of impacts, quantifying numbers of units impacted at certain levels of affordability over the 30-year period following the enactment of the legislation; and a narrative section to provide an explanation of the analyses that led to the estimates. Where the estimates are derived from existing grant applications or the basis of those estimates are otherwise straightforward, the narrative section shall state as such. Where the proposals being considered require the office of housing and community development to draw upon their experience and expertise to come up with a projected impact, the narrative section shall specify what assumptions were used in creating the estimates. If there is insufficient information such as to preclude any meaningful estimate from being made, the narrative section shall state as such.
(e)
The quantitative, or numeric section, shall take the following form, where the office of housing and community development shall fill in the blanks with appropriate estimates:
This legislation, if enacted, is estimated to have a projected impact upon the affordable housing stock of the City of Atlanta over the 30 year period following the enactment of the legislation by:

The office of housing and community development shall identify any duplicative impacts for which the same impact was covered by more than one item of legislation. This report shall also identify any housing policies enacted over the previous year that will have an enabling effect on the creation of affordable housing but for which an affordable housing impact statement was not created. This report shall also provide additional findings regarding any housing units funded in whole or in part by public grant dollars, for which affordable housing impact statements have been prepared, within the 30 year period preceding the annual report: specifically, the report shall specify whether the units still exist, whether they are occupied, and whether the cost for those units is consistent with the affordability price points identified in the original grant application.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 54-56. - Findings; initiation of program.
(a)
It is found that there are many residential properties within the corporate limits of the city that have become vacant through various processes. Many of these structures or sites have been abandoned by the tenants or owners who, for various reasons, have no longer found them acceptable for either habitation, ownership or economic purposes. It is found and declared that some of these properties have been and continue to be elements contributing to the deterioration of neighborhoods and the depreciation of property values in the neighborhood in which they are located. This situation leads to what constitutes a serious and growing menace injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the city residents. It is further found and declared that the existence of these vacant dwellings contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes economic and social liability, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of urban areas and exacerbates a growing urban slum condition. It is found that this form of blight is present in the inner city to a much greater degree than it is in the outer city, although the condition is found to exist throughout the city. Many of the residential properties that have become vacant are rehabitable. They are not totally without economic use and, if rehabilitated, could house citizens who need housing as a result of a variety of reasons, among which are displacement by eminent domain proceedings and a lack of housing starts due to general economic conditions.
(b)
It is further found that many other urban centers throughout the United States have been confronted with problems similar to this and have developed systems of urban homesteading. These programs take various forms depending upon the applicable laws of the several states and local jurisdictions within which these programs are being carried out. Regardless of the laws governing the various programs of urban homesteading, the economic impact of rehabilitating homes alone is sufficient to justify a program of urban homesteading, notwithstanding the additional benefits procured through this program. Home ownership has been found to be beneficial to the maintenance of property. Expectation of home ownership has been found to be beneficial to the fruition of housing rehabilitation, and homes in private ownership that are rehabilitated increase the tax base of a local government. A decrease in the providing of certain public services, such as police and fire protection, is an additional and indirect benefit to be derived from the rehabilitation of housing.
(c)
It is in consequence of these legislative findings stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section that the city enters into this urban homesteading program, which is declared to be a governmental function undertaken in the public interest.
(Code 1977, § 8-5021)
Sec. 54-57. - Funding.
No direct expenditures from the city's general fund revenues shall be incurred by the city in connection with the urban homesteading program.
(Code 1977, § 8-5029)
Sec. 54-58. - Urban homesteading application review board.
(a)
The urban homesteading application review board is established and created to act in an advisory capacity to the city on the urban homesteading program and to approve applicants as urban homesteaders.
(b)
The board shall be composed of five members. All members shall be residents of the city. The mayor shall appoint the five members of the board, who shall be selected from the following membership classifications and who shall be confirmed by the city council:
(1)
One appointee shall be a member of the residential construction industry;
(2)
One appointee shall be a member of the legal profession who specializes in or who is well acquainted with those areas of the law dealing with residential real estate;
(3)
One appointee shall be a representative of that sector of the financial community which specializes in residential lending activities; and
(4)
Two appointees shall be citizens of the city not otherwise eligible for appointment.
(c)
All appointments shall be for a term of two years. Members of the board may be appointed for consecutive terms.
(d)
The mayor shall recommend removal and replacement of a member of the board for nonperformance of duty. Any vacancy in the membership of the board shall be filled in the same manner as the initial appointment.
(e)
The board shall meet upon the call of the commissioner of housing and community development, at least quarterly, to review applications for urban homesteading. Following its deliberations the board shall certify to the commissioner of housing and community development those applicants who qualify under the criteria set forth in this division as urban homesteaders. For each applicant, the board shall adopt findings of fact upon which it shall base its determination as to whether the applicant qualifies as an urban homesteader. These findings of fact shall constitute a part of the record of the board's deliberations.
(f)
Each member of the board shall be paid $25.00 for each meeting of the board the member attends, but the total amount so paid any member shall not exceed the sum of $600.00 in any one calendar year.
(g)
The mayor shall appoint a presiding officer from among the membership of the board, and the board shall elect such additional officers as it deems necessary to carry out its functions.

Sec. 54-59. - Inventory list.
(a)
The city, acting through the department of housing and community development and working in conjunction with various other departments and bureaus of the government, is authorized to maintain an urban homesteading inventory of residential properties which may be received by the city through any means; provided, however, the residential properties to be maintained on this inventory shall be subject to inspection by the bureau of buildings and found to be redeemable for residential purposes.
(b)
Any residential property meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be eligible to be placed upon the urban homesteading inventory and disposed of as provided in this division.
(Code 1977, § 8-5022)
Sec. 54-60. - Determination of eligibility of property.
(a)
Prior to the determination of eligibility of a residential property to be placed upon the urban homesteading inventory, the department of housing and community development shall cause a title examination to be made upon each property by an attorney competent in the area of real estate abstract work, for the purpose of ascertaining what liens and charges constituting encumbrances are in fact on the property. A copy of the title report shall become a part of the file regarding this property. If there are monetary encumbrances or title defects appearing against any property which cannot be economically disposed of or passed through to a prospective urban homesteader, the commissioner of housing and community development shall have the right to reject the property from becoming part of the urban homesteading inventory. If, in the opinion of the commissioner of housing and community development, the monetary and other encumbrances are not sufficient to deter a prospective urban homesteader from entering into an agreement to pay all encumbrances on the property, the property shall become part of the city urban homesteading inventory and may be diverted from that purpose only by action of the mayor.
(b)
An additional criterion as to whether or not a property can be placed upon the urban homesteading inventory shall be an opinion of counsel doing the title search that the city either can or cannot pass free and unencumbered fee simple title to the property at a point in time no greater than three years from the date of the title search. If, in the opinion of counsel, fee simple unencumbered title cannot be so passed to an urban homesteader, the commissioner of housing and community development shall reject the property from becoming a part of the urban homesteading inventory.
(Code 1977, § 8-5023)
Sec. 54-61. - Qualifications of applicants; placement of applicants.
(a)
The commissioner of housing and community development may process applicants for the urban homesteading program. The commissioner of housing and community development shall present to the urban homesteading application review board for approval all those applicants who meet or appear to meet the criteria for urban homesteading as set forth in this section.
(b)
Every successful applicant for urban homesteading must:
(1)
Be 18 years of age or older and demonstrate a degree of personal stability necessary for taking on the responsibility of urban homesteading;
(2)
Possess the technical resources or financial resources or provide documentation to show that the applicant is able to obtain the financial resources or any combination of these resources necessary for completing the rehabilitation required to bring the condition of the urban homesteading structure up to city housing code requirements within the three-year period prescribed by the program;
(3)
Be a natural person;
(4)
Not have previously participated in an urban homesteading program in the city; and
(5)
Be willing to commit in writing to reside in the structure as the applicant's principal place of residence for a minimum of three years, that being the homesteading period for the urban homesteading program.
(c)
When an applicant has been approved as a qualified urban homesteader, the commissioner of housing and community development shall endeavor to place that person into a residential dwelling from the urban homesteading inventory. Placement of this person shall be made in the order in which applicants were approved by the urban homesteading application review board, except that a preferred place in the order of placement shall be given to those approved applicants who are residents of the city and to those approved applicants who have been displaced by governmental action on the part of the city or by other governmental action which resulted in the acquisition of their principal residences for a public project.
(Code 1977, § 8-5024(b), (c))
Sec. 54-62. - Leasing procedure.
(a)
When the urban homesteader and the commissioner of housing and community development agree on a suitable dwelling for the homesteader, the homesteader shall enter into either a lease agreement with the city or an urban homesteading agreement in combination with a deed of conditional conveyance. The forms of both types of documents will be prepared by the city attorney's office. The lease form or combination of urban homesteading agreement and deed of conditional conveyance, among other pertinent and legal data, shall:
(1)
Contain provisions for the payment of monetary encumbrances existing on the property;
(2)
Provide for a scheduled upward phasing of housing code compliance;
(3)
Include a statement on the part of the homesteader that, excepting circumstances beyond the homesteader's control, the homesteader will reside in the dwelling as a principal residence for a minimum of three years from the effective date of the agreement with the city;
(4)
Include a provision that the homesteader, during the term of the lease or combination of urban homesteading agreement and deed of conditional conveyance, obtain and maintain casualty insurance and owner's and occupier's liability insurance with a reputable insurance company licensed to do business in the state, which casualty insurance will include fire and extended coverage, vandalism and malicious mischief coverages. The amount of the casualty insurance shall be equal in amount to the value of the property, as determined by the city, and the liability insurance shall have minimum coverage in the amount of $25,000.00 per occurrence and $100,000.00 in the aggregate and name the city as coinsured;
(5)
Contain a provision that all utility bills shall be the responsibility of the homesteader; and
(6)
Provide that if its terms and conditions have not been met, upon proper notice and hearing to the urban homesteader, the lease or combination of urban homesteading agreement and deed of conditional conveyance shall be declared in default by the commissioner of housing and community development and terminated, subject to any subordination agreement.
(b)
Any urban homesteader forced to abandon the homestead by circumstances beyond the homesteader's control shall have the authority, subject to the approval of the commissioner of housing and community development, to assign the homesteader's rights under the lease or combination of urban homesteading agreement and deed of conditional conveyance to any other eligible homesteader for any consideration that the homesteader can negotiate. Any property so assigned shall be reported to the commissioner of housing and community development by the urban homesteader. Should any property be so assigned, the new urban homesteader shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the lease or combination of urban homesteading agreement and deed of conditional conveyance for the balance of the term of the instrument. Any urban homesteader who has assigned the homesteader's rights under these instruments to another individual shall be deemed ineligible for any other urban homesteading structure.
(Code 1977, § 8-5025)
Sec. 54-63. - Modification.
To the extent that the urban homesteading program, as expressed in the leases, modifies or amends housing code of the city, the program is authorized. However, the modification shall not exceed the following parameters:
(1)
Actual or constructive possession of leased urban homesteading property must take place and property improvements must be started within a 60-day period from the date of entering into the lease.
(2)
Six months from that date, the completion of plumbing, electrical, heating and roofing repairs are required so that the homesteader can move into the homesteading structure.
(3)
At the end of a two-year period from the date of entering into the lease, all exterior repairs required on the homesteading structure are to be completed.
(4)
At the end of the three years from the date of entering into the lease, all city housing code requirements on the homesteading structure are to be met before conveyance of deed and title can take place.
(5)
For homesteading properties that are multifamily structures or that contain rental units, the urban homesteader is expected to occupy one unit at the end of the first six-month work period. When all of the interior work has been completed on the unit the homesteader intends to occupy, when all of the required exterior work on the entire structure has been completed and when all of the interior work on the unit which the homesteader intends to rent has been completed, an urban homesteader may enter into a lease agreement with an individual for a unit in the structure.
(Code 1977, § 8-5026)
Sec. 54-64. - Nontaxable status of property.
During the period that an urban homesteading property is under lease, it shall be nontaxable property owned by the city, and no homesteader, during the period of this lease, shall be required to pay any ad valorem taxes thereon, except those accrued taxes arising by operation of law assessed against the property prior to the time of entering into the lease.
(Code 1977, § 8-5027)
Cross reference— Ad valorem taxes, § 146-26 et seq.
Sec. 54-65. - Conveyance of title.
At the end of the term of the lease of the urban homesteading property and provided there has been no default in the terms and conditions of the lease, the city shall convey the leased property, by warranty deed in fee simple, to the urban homesteader in possession of the property who is the named lessee under the lease or the assignees of the lease. Additionally, any homesteader shall be authorized to request the commissioner of housing and community development to convey an urban homestead to that urban homesteader at any time prior to the expiration of the term of the lease, provided the structure in which the homesteader is dwelling meets the criteria set forth in section 54-32 and provided that no conveyance of title shall be made prior to 12 months from the initial date of occupancy of the dwelling by the homesteader. All costs of the conveyance, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, recording costs, state revenue stamps, payment of any liens, including unpaid taxes, upon the property, and title insurance premiums, shall be borne by the urban homesteader. Should the urban homesteader fail and refuse to accept conveyance and fail to initiate steps to ensure conveyance, the lease the urban homesteader is holding shall be declared in default and the lease terminated.

Secs. 54-66—54-75. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - SECTION 810 PROGRAM

Sec. 54-76. - Findings.
(a)
It is found that there are many residential properties within the corporate limits of the city that have become vacant through various processes. Many of these structures or sites have become vacant by foreclosure or have been abandoned by owners who, for various reasons, have no longer found them acceptable for either habitation, ownership or economic purposes. Further, it is found and declared that some of these properties have been and continue to be elements contributing to the deterioration of neighborhoods and the depreciation of property values in the neighborhood in which they are located. This situation leads to what constitutes a serious and growing menace injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the city. It is further found and declared that the existence of such vacant dwellings contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes economic and social liability, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of urban areas and exacerbates a growing urban slum condition. Further, it is found that this form of blight is present in the inner city to a much greater degree than it is in the outer city, although the condition is found to exist throughout the city. Many of the residential properties that have become vacant are rehabitable. They are not totally without economic use and, if rehabilitated, could house citizens who need housing as a result of a variety of reasons, among which are displacement by eminent domain proceedings and a lack of housing starts due to general economic conditions.
(b)
It is further found that many other urban centers throughout the United States have been confronted with problems similar to this and have developed systems of urban homesteading. The economic impact of rehabilitating homes alone is sufficient to justify a program of urban homesteading, notwithstanding the additional benefits procured through such a program. Home ownership has been found to be beneficial to the maintenance of property. Expectation of home ownership has been found to be beneficial to the fruition of housing rehabilitation and homes in private ownership that are rehabilitated increase the tax base of a local government. A decrease in the providing of certain public services, such as police and fire protection, is an additional and indirect benefit to be derived from the rehabilitation of housing.
(Code 1977, § 8-5030)
Sec. 54-77. - City authorized as agent.
The city is authorized to act as agent for the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to process applications for rehabilitation loans on properties conveyed to the city pursuant to section 810 urban homesteading, as provided for in section 312(a)(1)(D) of the Federal Housing Act of 1964.
(Code 1977, § 8-5038)
Sec. 54-78. - Funding.
No direct expenditures from the city's general fund revenues shall be incurred by the city in connection with the section 810 urban homesteading program.
(Code 1977, § 8-5037)
Sec. 54-79. - Urban homesteading application review board.
The urban homesteading application review board established in section 54-28 shall act in an advisory capacity to the city on the section 810 urban homesteading program in approving applicants as urban homesteaders. It shall be the duty of the board to meet upon the call of the commissioner of housing and community development, at least quarterly, to review applications for urban homesteading. Following its deliberations the board shall certify to the commissioner of housing and community development those applicants who qualify under the criteria set forth in this division as urban homesteaders. For each applicant, the board shall adopt findings of fact upon which it shall base its determination as to whether the applicant qualifies as an urban homesteader. These findings of fact shall constitute a part of the record of the board's deliberations.
(Code 1977, § 8-5033(a))
Sec. 54-80. - Inventory list.
(a)
The city, acting through the department of housing and community development and working in conjunction with various other departments and bureaus of the government, is authorized to maintain a section 810 urban homestead inventory of residential properties which may be received by the city through the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to section 810 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974; provided, however, the residential properties to be maintained on this inventory shall be inspected by the bureau of housing production and found to be redeemable for residential purposes.
(b)
Any residential property meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall be eligible to be placed upon the section 810 urban homesteading inventory and disposed of as provided in this division.
(Code 1977, § 8-5031)
Sec. 54-81. - Determination of eligibility of property.
(a)
Prior to the determination of eligibility of residential properties to be placed upon the section 810 urban homesteading inventory, the department of housing and community development shall cause a title examination to be made upon each such property by an attorney competent in the area of real estate abstract work, for the purpose of ascertaining what liens and charges constituting encumbrances are in fact on the properties. A copy of the title report shall become a part of the file regarding such property. If there are monetary encumbrances or title defects appearing against any property which cannot be economically disposed of or passed through to a prospective urban homesteader, the commissioner of housing and community development shall have the right to reject the property from becoming part of the section 810 urban homesteading inventory. If, in the opinion of the commissioner of housing and community development, the monetary and other encumbrances are not sufficient to deter a prospective urban homesteader from entering into an agreement to pay all encumbrances on such property, the property shall become part of the city section 810 urban homesteading inventory.
(b)
An additional criterion as to whether or not a property can be placed upon the section 810 urban homesteading inventory shall be an opinion of counsel doing the title search that the city either can or cannot pass free and unencumbered fee simple title to the property at a point in time no greater than three years from the date of the title search. If, in the opinion of such counsel, fee simple unencumbered title cannot be so passed to an urban homesteader, the commissioner of housing and community development may reject the property from becoming a part of the section 810 urban homesteading inventory. The term "fee simple unencumbered title" as used in this section, shall not be construed to be such title as would cause rejection of those residential properties which have previously had placed upon them easements and other encumbrances of record which would not affect subsequent marketability of any such properties.
(Code 1977, § 8-5032)
Sec. 54-82. - Qualifications of applicants; placement of applicants in housing.
(a)
The commissioner of housing and community development is authorized to process applicants for the section 810 urban homesteading program.

(3)
The applicant must be a natural person;
(4)
The applicant must not have previously participated in an urban homesteading program in the city;

(7)
The applicant must be able to demonstrate a need for such housing.
(c)
When an applicant has been approved as a qualified urban homesteader, the commissioner of housing and community development shall endeavor to place that person into a residential dwelling from the section 810 urban homesteading inventory. Placement of such persons shall be made in the order in which applicants were approved by the urban homesteading application review board, except that a preferred place in the order of placement shall be given to those approved applicants who are residents of the city and to those approved applicants who have been displaced by governmental action on the part of the city or by other governmental action which resulted in the acquisition of their principal residences for a public project.
(Code 1977, § 8-5033(b)—(d))
Sec. 54-83. - Terms of agreement.
(a)
When the section 810 urban homesteader and the commissioner of housing and community development agree on a suitable dwelling for the homesteader, the homesteader shall enter into an agreement with the city on a form prepared by the city attorney's office. The agreement shall contain provisions whereby the homesteader to whom such property is conveyed agrees that the homesteader:
(1)
Use the property as a residence only;
(2)
Not assign the homesteader's interest to a third party without the consent of the city;
(3)
Not keep any explosives or highly inflammable substances on the premises, save only small quantities of combustibles such as cleaning fluid, gasoline, etc.;
(4)

(6)
If the urban homesteader should either file bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or have bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings filed against the homesteader, the city may, at its election, retake possession of the premises and void the conveyance;
(7)
Shall pay all applicable taxes due all appropriate taxing authorities imposed on the urban homesteading premises; and
(8)
Shall secure the necessary building permits, as applicable.
(b)
The urban homesteader shall assume such further obligations as shall be incorporated into a deed of conditional conveyance, prepared by the city attorney's office. The deed shall be subject to the terms and conditions that the homesteader shall:
(1)
Occupy the property as a principal residence for a period of no less than three years;
(2)
Make repairs required to meet minimum health and safety standards for occupancy prior to occupying the property;

(c)
Any urban homesteader forced to abandon the homestead by circumstances beyond the homesteader's control shall have the authority, subject to the approval of the commissioner of housing and community development, to assign the homesteader's rights under the agreement and deed of conditional conveyance to any other eligible homesteader for any consideration that the homesteader can negotiate. Any property so assigned shall be reported to the commissioner of housing and community development by the urban homesteader. Should any property be so assigned, the new urban homesteader shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the agreement and the deed of conditional conveyance for the balance of the terms of such instruments. Any urban homesteader who has assigned such homesteader's rights under such instruments to another individual shall be deemed ineligible for any other urban homesteading structure.
(Code 1977, § 8-5034)
Sec. 54-84. - Modifications.
To the extent this division is inconsistent with the city's housing code, the housing code is amended to comply with this division; provided, however, that the modification shall not exceed the following parameters:
(1)
Actual or constructive possession of leased urban homesteading property must take place and property improvements must be started within a 60-day period from the date of entering into the lease.
(2)
Six months from that date, the completion of plumbing, electrical, heating and roofing repairs are required so that the homesteader can move into the homesteading structure.

(5)
For homesteading properties that are multifamily structures or that contain rental units, the urban homesteader is expected to occupy one unit at the end of the first six months' work period. When all of the interior work has been completed on the unit the homesteader intends to occupy, when all of the required exterior work on the entire structure has been completed and when all of the interior work on the unit the homesteader intends to rent has been completed, an urban homesteader may enter into a lease agreement with an individual for a unit in the structure.
(Code 1977, § 8-5035)
Sec. 54-85. - Conveyance of property.
Under this division, at the end of the term set forth in the deed of conditional conveyance and provided there has been no default in the terms and conditions of either the agreement between the city and the urban homesteader or the deed of conditional conveyance, the city shall convey to the urban homesteader the property referenced in the deed of conditional conveyance by a limited warranty deed in fee simple.

(Code 1977, § 8-5036)
ARTICLE IV. - AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOMESTEADING PROGRAM

Sec. 54-86. - Procedures.
(a)
The director of real estate portfolio in consultation with the chief procurement officer or his or her designee will submit to the city's office of housing and community development in January of each year a list of potential surplus properties which are no longer useful or needed by the city. In determining whether city-owned real property is potentially surplus for the purposes of this article, the director of real estate portfolio will consider whether title to the real property is good, marketable and insurable.
(b)
The office of housing and community development will have 60 days after receipt of the list from the director of real estate portfolio to review the list and determine whether any of the potential surplus properties on the list are feasible for development as owner-occupied affordable housing. The office of housing and community development will consider the following factors in making its determination: (1) whether the property is large enough and of an appropriate shape for the development of one or more housing units; (2) whether utilities such as water, gas, and electricity would be available to one or more new housing units at the site; (3) whether the current zoning or land use designation of the parcel allows for residential uses; and (4) such other factors as the office of housing and community development deems necessary or appropriate, including the availability of property near public transit.
(c)
After the office of housing and community development identifies which potential surplus properties are feasible for development of owner-occupied affordable housing (the "affordable housing property list"), the office of housing and community development will submit an ordinance containing the requirements provided herein to the community development and human services committee. The ordinance will contain a finding that the properties on the affordable housing property list are surplus and will approve the properties to be advertised and disposed by request for proposals pursuant to chapter 2, article X, division 4, section 2-1189 and this article IV.
(d)
Upon Atlanta City Council approval of the ordinance, the office of housing and community development will send a request to the chief procurement officer to issue a public notice for request for proposals from nonprofit and for-profit developers to produce or rehabilitate owner-occupied housing units on a maximum of five surplus properties per developer per year that will be sold below market value. The request for proposals will encourage proposals that use creative strategies to lower construction costs for single-family homes, including partnerships with job training agencies, innovative methods of construction, and smaller houses, with a preference to develop housing targeting households earning zero to 30 percent of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Atlanta-Sandy Springs Marietta Area Median Income (AMI). The request for proposals will provide a maximum 90 day period to respond.
(e)
To become eligible to purchase a property, the nonprofit or for-profit developer must agree to develop owner-occupied affordable housing units on the property to be sold to households earning at or below 80 percent of the area median income (AMI) as calculated and published annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta metropolitan area, with a preference for projects targeting households earning zero to 30 percent of the AMI (the "Affordable Housing Covenant"). The affordable housing covenant will run for a term of 20 years. The affordable housing covenant will contain appropriate limits on homeowners gaining full equity from re-selling the owner-occupied units during the 20 year period.
(f)
The city's law department shall prepare the affordable housing covenant and all appropriate documents to be filed in the land records of Fulton County or DeKalb County to accompany any sale or resale of properties pursuant to this section in a manner consistent with this ordinance. Upon execution of an appropriate covenant, the chief procurement officer or his or her designee shall sell any properties deemed feasible for affordable housing to a non-profit developer or for-profit developer.
