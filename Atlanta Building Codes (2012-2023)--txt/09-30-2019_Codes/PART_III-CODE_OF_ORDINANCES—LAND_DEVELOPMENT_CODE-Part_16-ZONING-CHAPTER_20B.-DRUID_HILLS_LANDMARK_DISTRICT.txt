Sec. 16-20B.001. - Statement of intent.
The intent of establishing the regulations for the Druid Hills Landmark District is as follows:
(1)
To recognize the masterpiece of design that is the 1893 plan for Druid Hills created for Joel Hurt's "ideal residential suburb" by Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, a plan subsequently formalized by his sons, the Olmsted Brothers, and completed by the Druid Hills Corporation.
(2)
To preserve the environmental character and physical appearance of the area, including parkways, houses and buildings created during the 1895 to 1941 period of development; existing general landscaping features; and existing spatial relationships between the buildings and streets and to ensure that any new development is compatible with the present architectural and spatial attributes that prevail.
(3)
To preserve the residential character of the area except when nonresidential uses may be required to preserve houses and buildings built during the historically significant period of development and to ensure that redevelopment reflects and reinforces the exceptional features established in the original planning.
(4)
To ensure that new construction observes the general setback and height restrictions of the original development and is in harmony with the historic character of the district.
(5)
To ascribe special recognition to the manner in which the several churches contribute so substantially to the beauty of the district.
( Ord. No. 2015-58(15-O-1417), § 1(Att. A), 11-25-15 )

Sec. 16-20B.003. - General regulations.
The following general regulations shall apply to the entire district which includes the following subareas: (1) the Ponce de Leon Corridor; (2) Fairview Road; (3) Springdale Road/Oakdale Road/Lullwater Road/Lullwater Parkway and (4) Emory University. Any proposed development, new construction, addition, alteration, or demolition shall require a certificate of appropriateness as noted below and shall conform to the following regulations:
(1)
General standards. In the Druid Hills Landmark District, the Commission shall apply the following general standards only if the standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter 20B do not specifically address the application:
(a)
A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.
(b)
The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided.
(c)
Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties.
(d)
Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
(e)
Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved.
(f)
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials.
(g)
Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used.
(h)
Archaeological resources shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
(i)
New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment.
(j)
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(2)
Certificates of appropriateness.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the correct type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Zoning Ordinance.
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit.
(c)
No certificate of appropriateness shall be required for the removal of dead, dying, or hazardous tree as defined in the City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance or a tree with a diameter breast height of less than six inches.
(d)
Type I certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the Director of the Commission and are required for the following:
(i)
In-kind repair or replacement of roofing material, and in-kind repair of driveways, walkways, other similar paving, windows, and exterior doors.
(e)
The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the director of the commission and shall be required for new paving not visible from the public right-of-way, fences, walls, and retaining walls.
If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director of the commission shall issue the Type II certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates.
(f)
The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the commission and shall be required for the following:

(h)
Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure or contributing accessory building. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure or contributing accessory building shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's or buildings historic interpretability or importance.
(3)

b.
The director shall periodically review said List to correct errors or omissions to said List, or to reflect any changed conditions relevant to the contributing status of buildings, structures or sites within the district, consistent with the requirements of Chapter 20B and Chapter 20 of Part 16, and shall maintain public records of said List and all such errors, omissions or updates. An action by the director to correct such errors or omissions, or to make updates, shall be initiated by execution of a signed and dated form promulgated by the director specifying the action initiated, the reason(s) for such action, and the identification of all property subject to said action. Said form shall be mailed by first class mail to the owner or owners of the affected property within five calendar days of the initiation of the action by the director.
c.
An action by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, the List as authorized in subsection 16-20B.003(9)(a) above shall result in the immediate prohibition of any new or amended applications of any kind affecting such property, including but not limited to demolition requests, building permits or land disturbance permits, and including acceptance of any such application or request by any City of Atlanta bureau, agency, official, employee or agent. Said prohibitions shall become automatically effective without further action of any kind immediately upon the date and time that the director takes an action authorized in subsection 16-20B.003(9)(b) above. The purpose and intent of this provision is to maintain the status quo regarding any such affected property until the director's action is reviewed and affirmed or reversed by the commission in the manner specified in subsection 16-20B.003(9)(d) below. The period of this mandatory interim protection shall be 90 days or until a final decision reviewing such action is made by the commission, whichever first occurs, commencing on the date and time of the director's decision. This interim control period allows and is based upon approximately 30 days for the initial scheduling of the public hearing following the director's action and approximately 60 days for completion of the public hearing and a final decision by the commission.
d.
All actions by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, said List shall be reviewed and approved by the commission using the notice and procedures required for Type III certificates of appropriateness with the following modifications:
i.
Hearings on such review and approval by the commission shall be scheduled by the director within 30 days of the director's action on such correction(s) or update(s) and shall be decided by the commission within a reasonable time; and
ii.
The commission shall affirm the action(s) of the director upon an expressed finding by the commission that the director's action(s) correctly applied the definitions and requirements for determining the contributing status of the properties in question in Chapter 20B and Chapter 20 of Part 16.
In exercising its review, the commission may reverse or affirm the action(s) of the director, wholly or partly. Appeals from a final decision by the commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code section 16-20.010.
