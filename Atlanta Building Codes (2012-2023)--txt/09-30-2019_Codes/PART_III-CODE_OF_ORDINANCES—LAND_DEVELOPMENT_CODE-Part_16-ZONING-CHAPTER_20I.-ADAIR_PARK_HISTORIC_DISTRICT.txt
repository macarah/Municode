Sec. 16-20I.002. - Scope of regulations.
(a)
The existing zoning map and regulations governing all properties within the Adair Park Historic District shall remain in full force and effect. The following zoning regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations. Whenever the following overlay regulations are at variance with said existing zoning regulations, the following regulations (chapter 20I) shall apply. All other statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, or other governmentally adopted regulations pertaining to properties within this district shall continue to apply; and any variance between said other regulations and these overlay district regulations (chapter 20I) shall be governed by the interpretation provision set forth in section 16-20.011(c) of the Code of Ordinances.
(b)
Except when otherwise explicitly provided, the provisions of chapter 20 of this part shall apply to this district.
(Code 1977, § 16-20I.002)
Sec. 16-20I.003. - Boundaries.
The boundaries of the Adair Park Historic District shall be as shown on the official zoning map adopted herewith entitled the "Adair Park Historic District." The district is divided into three (3) subareas, as shown on said official zoning map, which shall be known as:
(1)
The Residential Subarea;
(2)
The Transitional Commercial Subarea; and
(3)
The Transitional Industrial Subarea.
(Code 1977, § 16-20I.003)
Sec. 16-20I.004. - Organization.
The overlay zoning regulations for the Adair Park Historic District are composed of two (2) parts. The first part consists of general regulations which apply to all property located within this district. The second part consists of specific regulations that apply to each of the subareas.
(Code 1977, § 16-20I.004)
Sec. 16-20I.005. - General regulations.
The following regulations shall apply to all properties within the Adair Park Historic District.
(1)
The Compatibility Rule: The compatibility rule is a method of requiring that alterations and new construction are sensitive and sympathetic to existing elements of design, scale and general character of the district with particular attention to the immediate environment constituting a particular block. In accordance with this purpose, the compatibility rule is as follows: "To the maximum extent possible, the element in question, such as roof form or architectural trim, shall substantially match that which predominates on that block. When elements are quantifiable, such as building height or floor heights, they shall equal the statistical average of all like elements of all structures of like use in that block." Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in regulations by reference to "compatibility rule."
(2)
Variances: The urban design commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein.
(3)
Signs: General advertising signs shall not be permitted in the historic district.
(Code 1977, § 16-20I.005)
Sec. 16-20I.006. - Specific regulations—Residential Subarea I.
In addition to the general regulations set forth in section 16-20I.005, and any other applicable regulations, the following regulations shall apply to all properties located within Residential Subarea I:
(1)
Certificates of Appropriateness: Certificates of appropriateness within this subarea shall be required as follows:
a.
When required:
1.
To change the exterior appearance of any portion of a structure within the subarea, when said change can be seen from the public right-of-way;
2.
To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any structure within the subarea, when said new structure or addition can be seen from the public right-of-way; and
3.
To demolish or move any contributing structure, in whole or in part, within the subarea.
b.
Type required:
1.
Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance are not required in this subarea. This exemption in no way obviates the requirements for certificates of appropriateness for all minor alterations (Type II), major alterations (Type III) and demolitions (Type IV, except partial demolitions).
2.
Except with regard to Type I certificates, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate required under subsection 16-20I.006(1)a. above shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the zoning code, provided, however, that a partial demolition shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features which destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance.
(2)
Financial Hardship Exemptions:
a.
These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility within the subarea. However, in order to balance this concern with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner.
b.
In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purpose.
c.
If the urban design commission finds that this requirement of subsection 16-20I.006(2)b. herein is satisfied, they shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted:
1.
The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property;
2.
The availability, at present or in the future of other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements;
3.
The cost associated with adherence to the subarea regulations;
4.
The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and
5.
The purpose and intent of this chapter.
d.
The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations.
(3)
