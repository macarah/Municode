Sec. 26-32. - User's fees.

The Juvenile Court of Union County may order each delinquent or unruly child who receives supervision under O.C.G.A. § 15-11-14, 15-11-35(a)(2) or (5), 15-11-35 or 15-11-36 to pay to the court clerk:

An initial court supervision user's fee of not less than $5.00, nor more than $100.00; and
(2)
A court supervision user's fee of not less than $1.00, nor more than $15.00 for each month that the child receives supervision.
The child and each parent, guardian or legal custodian of the child may be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the fee, and shall be subject to the enforcement procedure set forth in O.C.G.A. § 15-11-56(b). The judge shall attempt to provide that any such fees shall be imposed on such terms and conditions as shall assure that the funds for the payment of such fees are from moneys earned by the juvenile. All moneys collected by the clerk under this section shall be transferred to the county treasurer, or such other county official or employee who performs the duties previously performed by the treasurer, who shall deposit the moneys into a county supplemental juvenile services fund. The commissioner shall appropriate moneys from the county supplemental juvenile services fund to the Juvenile Court of Union County for the court's discretionary use in providing supplemental county based services as set forth in section 26-31 to juvenile offenders. Such funds shall be administered by the county, and the court may draw upon such funds by submitting invoices to the county. The county supplemental juvenile services fund may be used only for such services. Any moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the county fiscal year shall not revert to any other fund, but shall continue in the county supplemental juvenile services fund. The county supplemental juvenile services fund may not be used to replace other funding of services.
