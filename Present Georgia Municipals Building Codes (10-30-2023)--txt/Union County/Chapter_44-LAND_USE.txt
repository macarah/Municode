Sec. 44-115. - Perimeter buffers.
(a)
Buffers; when required. Buffers are required to be initially created at the time of construction of any new development.
(b)
Width of buffers.
(1)
A 50-foot buffer shall be required along the entire perimeter of the park. Except for the entrance road, the undisturbed buffer shall be planted with evergreen trees, vegetation, and shrubs, sufficient to screen the park from and to mitigate the negative effects of the park on the surrounding properties.
(2)
In those instances where a pre-existing single-family or farm dwelling is adjacent to the park development and the dwelling is within 100 feet of the property line, the required buffer shall be 100 feet along all adjacent property lines within 100 feet of the dwelling.
(3)
Where the site of a proposed park already has a natural buffer, and a developer utilizes and preserves that existing buffer, then the width of the required buffer may be reduced in whole or in part, so long as it is at least 25 feet in width and is of sufficient width and density to provide the required screening.
(c)
General.
(1)
Buffer areas shall contain no driveways (except the main entrance to the park); parking areas, patios, storm-water detention facilities, or any other structures or accessory uses except for a fence, wall, or earthen berm constructed to provide visual screening required to meet the standards of this article. Underground utilities may be permitted to cross a buffer if the screening standards of this article will be subsequently achieved.
(2)
Perimeter buffers shall not include any portion of an existing or proposed public or private street, road, or right-of-way.
(3)
All buffer areas shall be maintained as permitted in their mature planted condition, or restored to that condition if necessary.
(d)
Minimum required screening. Minimum required screening shall consist of a natural buffer utilizing existing vegetation, supplemental vegetation or a structural buffer, whichever provides an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet, or any combination of existing, supplemental or replanted vegetation which can reasonably be expected to create an opaque visual screen six feet high within three growing seasons.
(1)
Subject to approval, composition of the buffer may include a wall, fence, landscaped earthen berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of these elements, and should provide a visual screen around the park sufficient to prevent most visual contact from the perimeter of the property and create the impression of total separation.
(2)
The landscape plan shall prohibit clear cutting, and provide for minimal land disturbing, along with protection of the natural terrain.
(3)
Utilization of existing vegetation is always preferred.
(4)
Within the buffer, existing or planted deciduous or evergreen trees shall be spaced no more than 30 feet apart, and evergreen shrubs shall be planted with a spacing of between five to eight feet on center. Shrubs and trees shall be native species or those locally adapted to the area. The natural buffer shall provide an opaque visual screen during all growing seasons of the year.
(5)
New plantings comprising the buffer may be spread across the entire span of the buffer rather than planted in a row, so long as the screening objective is met. Every effort must be made to ensure sufficient maturity within three years to meet the screening requirements.
(6)
Fences and freestanding walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property.

Such associations must include homeowner's declaration and bylaws, including covenants, conditions and regulations applicable to each property in the development.

The homeowners association shall be formed under the provisions of Article 6 of Chapter 3 of Title 44 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, which is known as the "Georgia Property Owners' Association Act" (Code 1981, § 44-3-220, et seq. enacted by Ga. L. 1994, p. 1879, § 1).
(d)
The association shall, at a minimum, provide for proper maintenance and management of the parks, and shall prohibit all commercial and retail establishments on any lot within a park.

The association shall provide for or enforce the maintenance of all common areas, recreation areas, landscaping, and buffers, even if privately owned.
(f)
The association shall provide specifically that all park model RVs be new and not previously owned in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(g)
The by-laws shall provide that in the event that the homeowners association does not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the costs of necessary repairs and maintenance, and if the county finds it necessary to perform such repairs and maintenance for the health and safety of the residents, the county may then levy an assessment against all owners to cover these costs, and that these assessments shall constitute a lien against the real property, to be recorded in the public records.
(h)
Each deed or other conveyance for any land within a park shall be recorded in the public records of Union County and shall be subject to recorded restrictive covenants that shall be binding on each owner and occupant, and further contain a notice that all privately maintained interior streets, roads, drives and utilities, buildings, water system, septic systems, and any other systems or items used by the residents shall be constructed and maintained solely by the owners and/or residents, without cost to the county.

Enforcement.
(1)
The governing authority shall be authorized to enforce this article.

If, following a court appearance, a park developer, owner, resident, or lot owner subsequently remains in violation of this article for a period of 30 days, upon issuance of a second citation, the violator shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, the violator shall be ordered to remove, repair, remedy, or correct the violation, and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per citation and imprisonment for a period not to exceed one year.

Until repayment is made, a lien against the real property shall be recorded in the public records of Union County.

Sec. 44-138. - Variances.
The mere existence of a pre-existing non-conforming use or structure shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance. Upon written request sent by certified mail to the governing authority, a variance may but is not required to be granted at the discretion of the governing authority if the governing authority determines that all of the following conditions exist:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the site resulting from the size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands in the area.
(2)
Granting the variance would not adversely affect the viewshed of the surrounding single-family homes and farms in the community.
(3)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar park owners under this article.
(4)
Granting the variance will not confer upon the property or the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other properties.
(5)
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the community or to the general welfare.
(6)
The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant.
(7)
The variance would be a minimum variance which will make possible the logical use of the land or structure.
(8)
If the requested variance is granted, the park will in all other aspects be in full compliance with this article.
