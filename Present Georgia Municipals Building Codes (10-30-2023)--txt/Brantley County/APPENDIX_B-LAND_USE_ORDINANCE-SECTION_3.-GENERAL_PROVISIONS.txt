Whenever the provisions of these regulations impose greater restrictions upon the use of land or buildings, or upon the height of buildings, or require a larger percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied than the provisions of other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, or any covenants or other agreements between parties, then the provisions of these regulations shall govern.
3-2 - Land Use Affects All Land and Buildings.
No buildings, structures, or land shall be used or occupied; and no building, structure, or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged, or structurally altered unless in conformity with the regulations of this Ordinance.

Within a rear yard, an accessory building on a residential lot shall be located at least five (5) feet from all rear property lines and eight (8) feet from all other property lines, except that in the case of corner lots, accessory buildings shall be set back from the property line of an abutting street right-of-way a distance equal to three-fourths (3/4) the front yard setback established for the Land Use district in which the accessory buildings are located.

Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance which has an area or a width which is less than that required by this ordinance may be used as a building site for a structure or use permitted in that zone; provided, however, that the same yard, setback, open space, and other dimensional requirements are met that would be required for a standard lot, except for those properties deemed unacceptable for development by the Brantley County Health Department.
3-21 - Permitted Modification of Setback Requirement.
When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of this ordinance, the required setback for such building shall be as follows: (1) where only one said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a non-conforming setback the setback shall be the computed average of (a) the normal setback requirement with (b) the nonconforming setback, or (2) where both adjoining lots contain a principal building each with a non-conforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two non-conforming setbacks.
