Further, should a member of the board of commissioners be unable to attend a regularly scheduled or called meeting, then a written statement to the effect that the absent member wishes to vote affirmatively to waive the rules to allow a particular ordinance to be read three times at said meeting shall be deemed acceptable to allow the rules to be waived if all other commissioners vote to waive the rules. This will allow the reading of an ordinance three times and its adoption at a regular or called meeting.
