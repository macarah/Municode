It is the intent of this article that it will apply to and provide guidance for the development of lands within the incorporated limits of the city, whether the developments involve the subdivision of land or the construction of buildings and/or other improvements on a single parcel. Any land development activity must first comply with this chapter.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 9, ยง 3)
Sec. 111-338. - General provisions.
(a)
Zoning ordinance. Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or dimensions required under this article and those contained in the building codes or other ordinances or regulations of the city, the most restrictive shall apply.
(b)
Required public improvements. Every developer of lands within the jurisdiction of this chapter shall provide the public improvements included in this chapter, in accordance with this chapter and other pertinent ordinances, codes, and regulations of the city. These public improvements, together with associated rights-of-way, easements, and other lands, shall be provided at no cost to the city and shall be dedicated or otherwise transferred, as required, to the public in perpetuity and without covenant or reservation.
(c)
Plan review and approval. Any developer of land within the city shall first submit to the community development department such plans, plats, or construction drawings as may be required by these regulations and receive approval of those documents by the city prior to the initiation of development activities. Approval of plans, plats, or construction drawings by the city shall not imply nor transfer acceptance of responsibility for the application of the principles of engineering, surveying, architecture, landscape architecture, or any other profession, from the professional corporation or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans, plats, or construction drawings were prepared and sealed.
(d)
Other permits. Nothing in this chapter shall impose any obligation on the city to obtain or assist in obtaining permits, approvals, and/or clearances from other local, state or federal agencies having jurisdiction over elements of a project. It is solely the developer's responsibility to obtain all such required permits, approvals, and/or clearances. The developer shall furnish the community development department with copies of all such permits, approvals and/or clearances before authorization to proceed with development is requested.
(e)
Standard specifications. In addition to the construction standards found in the text of this chapter, the city will maintain on file for consultation and distribution a series of standard specifications for construction of improvements required for the development of land in accordance with this chapter. In conjunction with this chapter, the standard specifications describe minimum acceptable standards for the construction of required improvements, but shall not supersede more restrictive prudent design requirements or good engineering practice as applied to specific situations on a case-by-case basis. The standard specifications are included as appendix A of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(f)
Standard drawings. The city will maintain on file for consultation and distribution a series of standard drawings illustrating details of construction of public improvements, and other elements related to the development of land in accordance with this chapter. The standard drawings illustrate minimum acceptable construction standards for public improvements required under this chapter, but shall not supersede more restrictive prudent design requirements or good engineering practice as applied to specific situations on a case-by-case basis. The standard drawings are included as appendix B of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 9, ยง 4)

Right-of-way requirements.
a.
Minimum right-of-way and pavement widths.
1.
The minimum widths for public rights-of-way or private street ingress/egress easements and pavements shall be as shown in the Table of Minimum Right-of-Way and Lane Widths. See appendix B, Standard Drawings, of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived for detailed dimensions. Total width of streets includes land width plus curb and gutter (back of curb to back of curb) or from edge of pavement if no curbs exist. Local streets will use a 24-inch curb and gutter. Other road/street classifications will use a 30-inch curb and gutter. If an existing street is used for access, the developer shall conform to the existing street width.
2.
Minimum widths of rights-of-way and lanes shall be as shown in the Table of Minimum Right-of-Way and Lane Widths.

Number of lanes will be determined based on traffic volumes, except for subdivision streets which will be typically two lanes only.
Typical section details are shown in appendix B, Standard Drawings, of the ordnance from which this chapter is derived.
b.
Right-of-way dedication.
1.
The minimum width of rights-of-way shall be dedicated based upon the street classification, as provided in this section and approved by the city engineer.
2.
On any existing street abutting a proposed development, one-half of the required width of right-of-way shall be dedicated, at no cost to the city, as measured from the centerline of the roadway along the entire property frontage. Right-of-way widths for existing streets shall be based on the current classification as determined by the city engineer.
3.
Additional rights-of-way may be required at intersections or other locations fronting the property where turning lanes, storage lanes, medians, re-alignments or other traffic safety improvements are required.
4.
If a new street or thoroughfare is proposed by the city or the state to adjoin or traverse the property, the proposed road shall be accommodated into the development plans of the property in accordance with these regulations. These right-of-way requirements shall govern except where there exist clearly defined plans of the state department of transportation (GDOT) or the city that require additional rights-of-way. In that case, the greater right-of-way requirements shall govern.
c.
Clear zone requirements. All new roads/streets should utilize the concepts, designs, and philosophies in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Roadside Design Guide, where practical and feasible to use the latest state-of-the-practice in roadside safety. New roads/streets should also use context-sensitive design concepts in the applications of clear zone. Context-sensitive design concepts are also on the GDOT website (www.dot.state.ga.us). The application of clear zone concepts on existing roads/streets needs to be used where the greatest safety benefit can be realized. Crash reports, site investigations, and maintenance records offer starting points for identifying these locations.
(2)
Access management.
a.
Applicability. Except for development projects consisting of single-family dwelling units or industrial development, land development that takes its primary access from a state or federal highway or a thoroughfare classified as a collector, principal arterial or minor arterial shall comply with these standards. These standards shall apply unless a more restrictive standard is required by the GDOT.

c.
Minimum driveway setbacks from street intersections.
1.
Driveway connections. Driveway connections shall not be permitted within the functional area of the intersection of two public streets. The functional area includes the longitudinal limits of auxiliary or turning lanes.
2.
Minimum standards. No driveway access shall be allowed within 150 feet of the centerline of an intersecting major collector or arterial street, or within 100 feet of any minor collector street. The city engineer may reduce these required distances where they prove impractical due to lot frontages of less than 100 feet.
d.
Minimum access requirements.
1.
All developments shall have one or more driveways or entrances to a public right-of-way.
2.
The number of such access points shall be as shown in the Table of Minimum Number of Access Points.

Auxiliary lanes.
1.
Along any arterial or major collector street, a deceleration lane, acceleration lane, left turn lane, larger turning radius, traffic islands or other devices or designs may be required to avoid specific traffic hazards that, otherwise, would be created by the proposed driveway location, except in instances where the driveway is for a one- or two-family residence.
2.
Deceleration lanes shall be required by the city at each access point on roads classified as arterials or collectors when the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour or higher and otherwise where considered necessary by the city engineer based on traffic volumes. Deceleration lanes are required on city roads classified as arterial and major collector streets when the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour or higher. Minimum deceleration lengths are specified in the Table of Deceleration Lane Requirements. The city engineer may vary length requirements based upon a consideration of available sight distance and traffic volumes. For state routes and federal highways, GDOT requirements shall apply whenever more restrictive.

Requirements for new streets and roadways.
a.
Design and construction. All new streets proposed to be constructed in a subdivision or other development shall be designed and constructed to the minimum standards contained in these regulations, in accordance with the classification of streets.
b.
Street Classification. If a new street or thoroughfare is proposed by the city or the state to traverse the property, the proposed road shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the street classification as shown in these regulations or as shown on plans proposed by the city or state. The specific vertical and horizontal alignment of the proposed roadway shall be as established or approved by the city and/or the state, as applicable.
c.
Access from existing streets. Street widening. When property fronting on an existing city street is to be developed and when the property is to be accessed from the existing city street, roadway improvements (pavement, curb and gutter and drainage) are required along the existing road across the entire property frontage. Required improvements shall not be less than provided in these regulations for the designated street classification.
d.
Street widening. Widening, curb and gutter and drainage shall be provided from the centerline of the existing roadway along the side of the road upon which the property abuts. In lieu of installation of curbs and gutters and/or related improvements, the developer must have presented to and received approval by the city for a street improvements and stormwater drainage plan for the development and its affected environs. Said plan must provide for adequate stormwater drainage, and will further address, as a minimum, street grading, paving, and curbs and gutters, and/or other innovative provisions for said drainage. This plan must conform to the applicable standards and specification established by the city and be prepared, signed, and sealed by a state registered professional engineer.
e.
Developer responsible for relocation and/or modifications. The developer shall be responsible for the relocation and/or modifications of public and/or private utilities as necessitated by the required street improvements.
f.
Substandard streets.
1.
If a substandard street (dirt or gravel road or inadequate width of pavement or right-of-way) provides a means of access to a development, the street shall be upgraded to the street classification standard required by this chapter. These improvements shall extend from the entrance of the development to the nearest standard paved road of an equivalent or higher classification, along the route of primary access.
2.
In the event that a development has access to a substandard street and if that substandard street is other than the primary means of access to the development, the substandard street, except as indicated below, shall be fully upgraded only along the entire property frontage and shall be paved on the opposite side of the road from the development, 12 feet from the street centerline.
3.
The upgrading of substandard streets used for access will not be required if any of the following conditions are met:
(i)
The development consists of a single one- or two-family residence on an existing recorded lot within the city;
(ii)
Total traffic on the substandard street is less than 2,000 vehicles per day, including projected traffic volume from the development.
g.
Improvements along state highways. For any development which abuts a state or federal highway, improvements to the roadway and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the state highway shall comply with the standards and requirements of the state department of transportation and these regulations. A permit for the proposed access or improvements shall be required to have been approved by the GDOT and incorporated into the construction drawings for the project prior to issuance of a development permit by the city.
h.
Permanent dead-end streets. New streets shall connect at both ends to existing streets unless the city engineer determines that unique parcel configuration or terrain make a fully connected street pattern infeasible or unsafe.
1.
When necessary, streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround and may be no more than 600 feet in length, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer.
2.
The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center of the cul-de-sac to the center of the intersection with another street.
3.
Cul-de-sacs shall conform to the standard drawings found in appendix B of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
i.
Temporary dead-end streets.
1.
A temporary dead-end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision to provide access to abutting property for planned continuity of future circulation, improved access for public safety vehicles or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring properties. Such dead-end streets shall be designed to meet the requirements of these regulations and to allow their reasonable extension and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. A temporary vehicular turnaround shall be provided as required by the subdivision regulations.
2.
Existing dead-end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development.
3.
Subsections (4)i.1 and 2 of this section may be modified by the city engineer in cases of serious topographical hardship or unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of a cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead-end street or the removal of the dead-end street back to its nearest intersection.
4.
Where a dead-end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves four or more lots in a multi-phase subdivision and such street is to be extended later, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround complying with subsection (4)i.1 of this section. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead-end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat.
j.
Access roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, major utility easement, limited access highway right-of-way or a major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. Locations of such service roads shall be aligned with similar service roads on adjacent properties.
k.
Construction access drives. Construction access drives are required for vehicles with a gross weight of 10,000 pounds or more.
1.
On multi-phase developments, the developer shall be required to dedicate, install, maintain and remove temporary construction access drives for the ingress and egress of construction vehicles, personnel and equipment.
2.
Temporary construction access drives shall be shown on the concept plan and preliminary plat and shall access an existing city road where possible. Construction access drives shall be permitted through the city, and shall comply with sight distance requirements in subsection (3)e of this section.
3.
Temporary construction access drives shall be utilized as the sole means of ingress and egress during the construction of subsequent phases of the development, to prevent the flow of construction and heavy vehicular traffic on newly constructed streets completed under earlier phases.
4.
If the city engineer determines that a temporary construction access drive cannot be provided, due to site-specific restrictions, then the developer shall provide a maintenance bond for those portions of the newly constructed roadway utilized for construction access.
l.
Half streets. Both the construction of new half streets and the extension of access to existing half streets shall be prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed development tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed development.
m.
Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way, which could control or is intended to control access to streets, alleys or public lands, shall not be permitted unless control is given to the city under ownership, dedication or easement conditions approved by the city attorney or acceptable to the city engineer. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties.
n.
Alleys. Alleys are to be constructed to the following standards:
1.
Minimum width of right-of-way or easement: 20 feet.
2.
Minimum 14-foot-wide paved travel lane.

(iii)
Alleys shall be signed, "Fire Lanes - No Parking."
o.
Street jogs.
1.
Local streets shall either directly align or have offsets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential subdivision streets and a minimum of 200 feet for nonresidential subdivision streets, as measured between the centerlines.
2.
Where it is not feasible to align new streets or entrances with an existing street intersecting nearby on the opposite side of a collector or arterial street, then the new street intersection shall be no less than 600 feet from the intersection of the existing street, as measured between centerlines of the two opposing streets.
p.
Traffic calming measures. Street layout and configuration should include a series of relatively short interconnected roadways in lieu of longer straight roads, to discourage excessive speeds. Additional traffic calming measures may be required by the city engineer. Any specific measures employed shall be approved by the city engineer.
(5)
Street intersection.
a.
Angle of intersections. Intersections of two public streets shall form an angle that is between 80 and 100 degrees, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. If the intersection is signalized, the angle of the intersection may be reduced subject to the review and approval of the city engineer.
b.
Intersection approaches.
1.
The approaching street at any intersection shall be designed and constructed to provide both the minimum horizontal and vertical approach distances, as defined in this section and indicated in the Table of Intersection Approach Distances contained in this subsection b.
2.
Minimum horizontal approach distance is defined as the minimum distance required along the centerline of an approaching street, perpendicular or no less than 85 degrees to the intersected street, as measured from the edge of pavement of the intersected street to the point of horizontal curvature on the approaching street.
3.
Minimum vertical approach distance is defined as the minimum distance required along the centerline of the approaching street, at a grade less than or equal to the recommended grade indicated in the Table of Intersection Approach Distances, as measured from the edge of pavement of the intersected street to a point on the profile of the approaching street where grades exceed recommended values.
4.
The use of vertical curves, drainage boxes or other approved methods shall be used in the design of the approaching street at any intersection to prevent drainage of surface water from draining into the travel lanes of the intersected street.

Sec. 111-340. - Utilities.
All authorized public utilities must be installed by a state licensed underground utility contractor who must meet minimum bonding and insurance requirements as determined by the city.
(1)
Placement of utilities. All authorized public and private underground or overhead utilities shall be located within the right-of-way of a public street or within an easement designated for such use. Within public street rights-of-way, placement of the various authorized utilities (water, sanitary sewer, natural gas, power, telephone, and cable TV) shall conform to the specific locations for such use designated by the city. Private underground utilities such as lawn sprinkler systems, septic tanks and drain fields, exterior lighting systems, and heating and cooling piping are not permitted within public street rights-of-way.
(2)
Easements.
a.
Easements required. Permanent easements for public water, drainage and sanitary sewer facilities shall be dedicated to the city.
b.
Easement widths. The minimum width of permanent easements for a single utility shall be 15 feet. Where more than one utility has a common easement, the minimum easement width shall be increased by five feet for each additional utility. However, additional easement widths may be required by the city where the depth of the utility is excessive or other conditions will cause difficulty in accessing the utility.
c.
Dedication requirements. Before dedication, the developer shall grass and stabilize all disturbed areas within and adjacent to easements which are not covered by paving or other improvements. An acceptable stand of grass free of eroded or bare areas must be achieved before the city will consider dedication.
(3)
Utility line extension requirements. If existing water mains and/or sanitary sewers must be extended to serve a development, the developer shall install or have installed the necessary extensions at no cost to the city under the existing city policy and procedures at plan approval time.
(4)
Water distribution system design criteria.
a.
Pressure. All water mains, including those not designed to provide fire protection, shall be sized after hydraulic analysis performed by a state registered professional engineer to maintain a minimum pressure of 40 psi at ground level under all conditions of design flow. Regardless of water system design pressure and flows, all water mains shall be a minimum of eight inches.
b.
Design flow. The design flow is to consist of projected peak demand plus fire flow (where applicable). To determine projected peak flow for residential developments, utilize values in the Table of Peak Water Demands for Residential Developments. For developments other than residential, utilize AWWA "Manual of Water Supply Practices M22, Sizing Water Service Lines and Meters" to estimate peak demand. For fire flow, select proper value from the Table of Minimum Design Fire Flows.
c.
Sprinkler connections. For each fire protection sprinkler connection to the city's water system, the developer must provide a double detector check valve installation consisting of not less than two detector check valves with bypass meter on the second unit and two gate valves all enclosed in an accessible, non-floodable concrete pit. The pit is to have a double leaf aluminum access hatch which should be sized for easy access for maintenance.
d.
State approval. It is the developer's responsibility to obtain the approval of the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources of all water distribution system additions and extensions. In addition to the other requirements, the city must receive a copy of the approval before the developer will be allowed to proceed with construction.
(5)
Location of water mains, fire hydrants and other fixtures.
a.
Water mains. Water mains shall be located along city streets on the south and west side of the street, five feet from the back of the curb. The minimum cover is to be 42 inches.

Maximum hourly commercial/institutional sewage flow.
3.
Maximum hourly industrial sewage flow.
4.
Groundwater infiltration.
5.
Topography of the area.
6.

7.
Design new sewers in residential areas on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. A peaking factor of not less than 2ยฝ must be applied to the average daily flow to establish peak design flow. Sewers shall be designed to carry peak design flow when flowing one-half full.
8.
In nonresidential developments, base sewer design on the estimated peak flow from the development but in no case less than 0.4 gallon per square foot of gross building areas. Sewers shall be designed to carry peak flow when flowing one-half full.
b.
Size and shape. The minimum size sanitary sewer shall be eight inches. Design sewers to give mean velocities, when flowing half full, of not less than 2.0 feet per second based on the Manning formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The Table of Minimum Sewer Slopes contained in this section gives the minimum as-built slopes which must be provided to allow dedication of sewers to the city; however, where possible, greater slopes are desirable. Sewers shall be placed with a uniform slope between manholes.
c.
Manholes.
1.
Install manholes at the following locations:
(i)
End of each sewer.
(ii)
At all changes in grade, size, or alignment.
(iii)
At all sewer intersections.
(iv)
At distances not greater than 400 feet for sewer 15 inches and smaller.
2.
When pipe sizes change at a manhole, the 0.8 depth point of both sewers shall be aligned at the same elevation.
3.
When the same size pipe enters and leaves a manhole, at least a 0.1-foot drop in elevation shall be provided between the entering and the exiting inverts.
4.
U-shaped flow channels shall be constructed through manholes.
d.
Relation to water mains.
1.
Whenever possible, lay sewers at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions prevent a separation of ten feet, lay the lines in separate trenches. In either case, construct the elevation of the crown of the sewer at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main.
2.
When sewers cross under water mains, lay the sewer so that the top of the sewer is at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main. Install the two pipes such that a full length of pipe will be centered over the crossing so that all joints will be separated as much as possible. Install ductile iron pipe for both lines when the crossing is less than two feet of separation.
