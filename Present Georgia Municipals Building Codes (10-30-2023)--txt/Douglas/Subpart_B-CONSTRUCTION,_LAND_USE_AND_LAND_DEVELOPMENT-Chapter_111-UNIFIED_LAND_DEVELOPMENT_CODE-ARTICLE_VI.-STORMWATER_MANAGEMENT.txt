ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT

Sec. 111-170. - Purpose.
(a)
Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants; and stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
(b)
The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
(2)
Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
(3)
Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime;
(4)
Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety;
(5)
Provide a guideline of minimum stormwater requirements for developers and property owners;
(6)
Assist in maintaining eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 6, § 1)
Sec. 111-171. - Applicability.
(a)
This article shall be applicable to all projects causing an increase in stormwater runoff quantity by the addition of impervious surfaces, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a variance by the city under the specifications of this chapter. This article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules.
(b)
To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the city has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development and redevelopment sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one acre or more and to construction activity disturbing less than one acre that increases the amount of impervious area by ten percent. The following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria:
(1)
Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or approved by the state or other applicable regulatory authority, as applicable;
(2)
Single-family structures if the lot is not part of a common development; additions or modifications to existing single-family structures;
(3)
Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land and do not increase the amount of impervious surface area by at least ten percent, provided the developments are not part of a larger common development plan. Documentation must be provided by the developer or his qualified representative as determined by the city;
(4)
Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by and/or approved by the city.
(c)
When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by this section. These stormwater requirements are dependent on the amount of increase in stormwater runoff created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by city marshal. In no case shall the stormwater runoff be increased by more than one cubic foot per second for a ten-year frequency storm event, without providing adequate stormwater management.

Sec. 111-181. - General performance criteria for stormwater management.
Unless judged by the city to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites:
(1)
All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
(2)
All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not impact a jurisdictional wetland or local water body. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (ACE).
(3)
The proposed improvements shall, if possible, promote infiltration through the use of structural and nonstructural methods. The proposed improvements shall, if possible, mimic the post development site annual groundwater recharge rates to the pre-development site annual groundwater recharge rate.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 6, § 13)
Sec. 111-182. - Basic stormwater management design criteria.
(a)
Minimum control requirements. Unless the city grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from the requirements, this article shall control the release of stormwater runoff. All new developments or redevelopments shall provide controlled release of stormwater runoff generated by the two-year, five-year, ten-year, 25-year, 50-year and 100-year 24-hour frequency storm events. The peak release rate of stormwater runoff from a new development or redevelopment shall not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate of the pre-developed site for all storm intensities listed above. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, time and rate of runoff.
(b)
Site design feasibility. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be considered are:
(1)

(1)
Maximizing flow paths from inflow points to outflow points;
(2)
Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
(3)
Elimination of erosive flow velocities;
(4)
Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
(d)
Maintenance agreements. All stormwater treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any stormwater management permits.
(e)
Nonstructural stormwater practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices.
