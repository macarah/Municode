State Law reference— Code of ethics for government service, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1; Ethics in Government Act, O.C.G.A. § 21-5-1 et seq.

Sec. 2-684. - Policies.
The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his own private standing. The principle policies which form the foundation of this article are:
(1)
The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
(2)
The Constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and the state and ordinances of the city should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct.
(3)
The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.
(4)
Elected officials should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their elected office.
(5)
All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality.
(Code 1993, pt. II, § 2-461; Ord. No. 11232009 , 11-23-2009)
Sec. 2-685. - Intent.
It is the intent of this article that the city commission members shall not knowingly engage in any activity which is incompatible with the proper discharge of their official duties or which would tend to impair their judgment or actions in the performance of their official duties. Furthermore, city commission members should avoid any action which might result in or create the appearance of the following:
(1)
Using public office for private gain.
(2)
Impeding city efficiency or economy.
(3)
Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of those who conduct the affairs and business of the city.
(Code 1993, pt. II, § 2-462; Ord. No. 11232009 , 11-23-2009)
Sec. 2-686. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Benefit means anything, regardless of its monetary value, perceived or intended by either the one who offers it or the one to whom it is offered or which, under certain circumstances, a reasonable prudent person would recognize as being sufficient in value or likely to be intended to influence a member of the city commission in the performance or nonperformance of an official action.
City official or official, unless otherwise expressly defined, does not include city employees but does mean the mayor, members of the city commission, municipal court judges (including substitute judges), city manager, city clerk, city attorney, and all other persons holding positions designated by the city Charter, as amended. The term "city official" also includes all individuals, including city employees, appointed by the mayor and/or city commission as appropriate to city authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the mayor and/or city commission.
Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the city commission or other city board or commission, as well as the discussions or deliberations of the board or commission, which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body.
Employee means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the city.
Immediate family means the spouse, mother, father, grandparent, brother, sister, son or daughter of any city official related by blood, adoption or marriage. The relationship by marriage shall include in-laws.
Incidental interest means an interest in a person, entity or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value.
Remote interest means an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public.
Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where:
(1)
The interest is ownership of five percent or more of the voting stock, shares or equity of the entity or ownership of $5,000.00 or more of the equity or market value of the entity;
(2)
The funds received by the person from the other person or entity during the previous 12 months either equal or exceed:
a.

b.
Ten percent of the recipient's gross income during that period;
whichever is less;
(3)
The person serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors or other governing board of a for-profit entity other than a corporate entity owned or created by the city commission; or
(4)
