ARTICLE XI. - SOLAR ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS

Sec. 111-408. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Ordinance means this solar ordinance.
Permit means any permit required by federal, state, or local law or regulation, including this ordinance.
Solar Energy System (SES) means a device or structural design feature that provides for the collection, storage, and distribution of solar energy for electricity generation. For purposes of this ordinance, SES refers only to: (1) photovoltaic SESs that convert solar energy directly into electricity through a semiconductor device; or (2) solar thermal systems that use collectors to convert the sun's rays into useful forms of energy for water heating, space heating, or space cooling. SES as used in this ordinance excludes concentrated solar systems that use mirrors to focus the energy from the sun to create thermal energy that can be used to produce electricity.
(1)
Building-integrated solar energy system means an SES where solar materials are used in place of traditional building components such that the SES is structurally an integral part of a house, building, or other structure, for example as a building facade, skylight, or shingles.
(2)
Rooftop solar energy system means an SES that is structurally mounted to the roof of a house, building, or other structure.
(3)
Ground mounted solar energy system means an SES that is structurally mounted to the ground. For purposes of this ordinance, the acreage of land occupied by a ground mounted solar energy system is calculated by drawing a perimeter around the outermost SES solar panels and auxiliary structures. Substations and transmission lines outside this perimeter shall not be included in the calculation.
(4)
Small scale ground mounted solar energy system (small scale SES) means a ground mounted SES that occupies less than three acres.
(5)
Intermediate scale ground mounted solar energy system (intermediate scale SES) means a ground mounted SES that occupies between three and 15 acres.
(6)
Large scale ground mounted solar energy system (large scale SES) means a ground mounted SES that occupies more than 15 acres.
Visual buffer means natural vegetation, plantings, earth berms, and/or decorative fencing that provide a visual and lighting barrier between an SES and a residential property. The visual buffer is not part of the SES and shall not be included when: (1) calculating the acreage of land occupied by the SES; or (2) determining whether the SES adheres to applicable setback requirements.
Zoning authority means the applicable county or city land use decision-making body as determined by local ordinance and appeal procedures.

Sec. 111-413. - General requirements for ground mounted solar energy systems.
The following requirements apply to all small, intermediate, and large scale ground mounted SESs, in addition to the specific requirements in this ordinance that apply to each SES size respectively:
(1)
Solar access. A property owner may obtain a solar easement from another property owner for the purpose of ensuring the ground mounted SES adequate exposure to sunlight.
(2)
Visual buffer. A ground mounted SES shall require a visual buffer where the SES is visible from residential property. If the visual buffer utilizes natural vegetation or plantings, it shall be of a size and thickness sufficient to provide a visual and lighting barrier between the SES and the residential property within 12 months from the completion of construction of the SES. All other visual buffers shall be in place at the time the SES commences operation.
(3)
Impervious surface. An SES shall comply with federal, state, and local stormwater management, erosion, and sediment control provisions and impervious surface coverage requirements. For purposes of compliance with such regulations, an SES shall be considered pervious if it maintains sheet flow and allows for water to infiltrate under and around the panels through a pervious surface and into the subsoil.
(4)
Lighting. To reduce light pollution, lighting of a ground mounted SES shall:

Tree removal. The removal or destruction of trees or natural vegetation for an SES shall comply with the requirements of the underlying zoning ordinance. If a ground mounted SES is built on a lot with more than 70 percent tree coverage, then no more than 25 percent of the existing tree coverage may be removed and replaced. In a case of hardship due to the lack of sunlight, a variance up to 50 percent of existing trees may be approved by the building inspector.
(6)
Maintenance. A ground mounted SES shall be maintained in good working order.
(7)
Abandonment. A ground mounted SES shall be considered abandoned if it ceases to produce energy on a continuous basis for more than 12 months without prior approval from the zoning authority.
(8)
Decommissioning. If a ground mounted SES has reached the end of its reasonable life or it is abandoned, then:
a.
A small scale SES and all structures associated with it shall be removed and all materials shall be recycled or otherwise reused to the extent reasonably practicable; and
b.
An intermediate or large scale SES shall be decommissioned in accordance with decommissioning plan in the permit application (see section 111-417(5)).
