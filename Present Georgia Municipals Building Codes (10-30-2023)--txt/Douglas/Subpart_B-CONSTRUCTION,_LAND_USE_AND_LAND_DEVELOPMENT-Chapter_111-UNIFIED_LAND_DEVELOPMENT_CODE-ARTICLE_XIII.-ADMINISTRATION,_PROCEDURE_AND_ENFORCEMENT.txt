Appeals to these regulations may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board by filing with the city manager from whom the appeal is taken and with the zoning board of appeals notice of said appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The city manager shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
(2)
An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the commission after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with the city manager, that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the officer's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property.

(2)
To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases a variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, vowing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this Code shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the zoning board of appeals that:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
b.
The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
c.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and

(3)
To decide on other matters where a decision of the zoning board of appeals may be specifically required by the provisions of this chapter. In exercising these powers, the zoning board of appeals may be reversed or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
