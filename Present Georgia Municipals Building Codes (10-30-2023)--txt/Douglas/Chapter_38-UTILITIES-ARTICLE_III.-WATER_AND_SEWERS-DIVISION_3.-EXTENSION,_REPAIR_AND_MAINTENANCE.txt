The determination shall be made prior to the issuance of any building or occupancy permit. If the applicant for connection to the utility system installed by others is applying for such service of an existing structure, the determination of the rebate shall be determined in keeping with the policy hereinabove established.

Reimbursement to original applicant only. The reimbursement noted in this section shall be paid only to the original applicant and may not be assigned or in any way inure to subsequent owners of the property originally served by the subject utility installation and shall terminate upon change in ownership of the property originally served by the utility extensions. Should the original owner include in the cost of any lot sold the pro rata cost of such installation, the reimbursement shall be null and void.
