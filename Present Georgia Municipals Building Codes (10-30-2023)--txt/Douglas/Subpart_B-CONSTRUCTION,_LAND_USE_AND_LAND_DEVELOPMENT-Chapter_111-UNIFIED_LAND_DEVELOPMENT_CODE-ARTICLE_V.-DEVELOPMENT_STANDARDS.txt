Sec. 111-134. - Planned development standards.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The purpose of this section is to provide an alternative means of residential, commercial, public service, industrial and mixed use land development and an alternative zoning/site plan review procedure that may be used to establish residential, commercial, public service, industrial and mixed use zoning districts at appropriate locations and in accordance with the planning and development objectives of the city.
(2)
A planned development (PD) established according to the provisions of this section may depart from the strict application of use, setback, minimum lot, parking, and other requirements of standard zoning districts. A PD shall be consistent with the overall planning and development goals of the city. It is the purpose of this section to offer flexibility for development while maintaining and protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the city's residents.
(3)
This section intends to establish a more holistic living and working environment by enabling the application of creative and imaginative approaches to development design and community planning. A PD should provide a variety of natural features and open spaces, efficient and economical land use, improved amenities, orderly development, and the protection of existing and future adjacent development and properties. Therefore, the PD alternative may allow uses and combination of uses which are not specifically allowed in standard zoning districts.
(b)
Prevailing code. To the extent that any provisions of this section conflict with other provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
(c)
Definition of planned development.
(1)
A planned development (PD) may be a residential PD, a commercial PD, a mixed use PD, an industrial PD, or a public service PD. A PD shall consist of land under unified control which may be planned and developed as a whole as a single development or as an approved programmed series of developments by multiple developers. A typical PD will include principal and accessory uses and structures that are substantially related to the character of the development itself and to the surrounding area of which it is a part. The term "unified control," as used in this subsection, shall mean that all land to be included within a PD shall be owned or otherwise under the legal control of the person or legal entity which has applied for the PD zoning district. Such person or entity shall be legally capable of providing a commitment to the city that the PD development will comply with all PD documents, plans, standards, and conditions ultimately approved by the city.
(2)
A PD zoning district shall consist of the approved PD classification, the PD conceptual master plan and the PD final development plan, as well as any other plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically included as development documents in the approval of the PD by ordinance by the city commission. The ordinance approving a PD shall be deemed a zoning ordinance. The provisions of the individual PD zoning ordinance shall replace all conflicting development regulations set forth in this chapter which would otherwise apply to the development. The PD ordinance shall be recorded in the public records of the county and the city.
(3)
The applicant may proceed with development or any land-disturbing activities only after a plat, if required by the city commission, is recorded and after certification by the community development director that the building plans and other required documents and information substantially conform to all documents approved as part of the PD ordinance. The applicant must also provide evidence that would bind his successors in title to any commitments made for the approval of the PD.
(d)
Zoning map. The boundaries of land zoned PD by ordinance of the city commission shall be indicated as such on the official zoning map of the city.
(e)
Location. A PD may be located anywhere in the city.
(f)
Minimum size. The minimum size of a PD is two acres.
(g)
General requirements.
(1)
Circulation, parking, utilities, drainage and other standards. PD standards for circulation, parking, utilities, drainage and other standards shall apply as described in this chapter, except as specifically modified by the city commission as part of the PD ordinance.
(2)
Open space. Not less than 25 percent of the PD shall be open space. Required open space may include all common vegetation and landscape areas.
(3)
Maximum building area. Not more than 50 percent of the total development site shall be covered by buildings.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 5, § 9)
Sec. 111-135. - Procedures for PD rezoning/land development approval.
(a)
Initial application. In addition to information required for an application for rezoning in general, an applicant for PD zoning/development approval shall submit the following materials and data to the community development department:
(1)
Legal documents demonstrating unified control over the proposed PD.
(2)
A PD application, which includes:
a.
The title of the project (name);
b.
The names of the professional planners and engineers and the developers;
c.
A master development plan to include a boundary and topographic survey of the proposed PD site and an inclusive list of all uses proposed to be located within the PD and on each parcel thereof;
d.
Computation of the gross acreage of each use and the proposed PD overall;
e.
Any other matter deemed relevant by the community development director to the development and use of the property.
(b)
Fees. Each applicant for a rezoning/development approval to PD shall pay a fee to the city for examination of the proposed PD application and related materials and the inspection of all required improvements shown on such plans. Such fee shall be determined by the city commission by resolution.
(c)
Procedure. Upon application for rezoning/development approval of land to a PD zoning district, submission of a master development plan and other documents deemed appropriate by the applicant or required by the community development director, appropriate city staff, the planning commission and city commission shall process and review the application as a rezoning of land as follows:
(1)
Pre-application meeting. The applicant and city staff shall jointly review the application, master development plan and all other documents associated with the application at a pre-application meeting. The purpose of this pre-application meeting is to discuss the application at an informal setting and identify all zoning and other regulations applicable to the property and to identify specifically those variations from the regulations which may be justified with this application.
(2)
Planning commission.
a.
Following the pre-application meeting, upon receipt of a complete application and completion of the review by the community development department, a rezoning/development approval review shall be conducted by the planning commission held as for other applications for rezoning.
b.
The planning commission will require, prior to its recommendation to the city commission, evidence of the PD impact on traffic, water and sewer facilities in the area.
c.
The planning commission shall either recommend to the city commission that the PD district rezoning be granted and that the application, the master development plan, individually or in combination with a final PD development plan, and any other required plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically included as part of the application, be approved, with or without conditions, or that the application be denied. In making the recommendation, the planning commission shall find that the application and the master development plan, individually or in combination with a final PD development plan, and any other required plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically included as part of the application, does or does not meet the requirements of this chapter and specifically this section.
(3)
Conditions. In approving a rezoning of land to a PD district classification, the planning commission may recommend and the city commission may approve a variation of the strict application of the development requirements of this chapter and may instead impose appropriate conditions to otherwise attain the objectives of this chapter. These conditions shall be binding upon the applicant and successors with interest in the PD. Deviations from approved plans except in a manner described in this chapter or failure to comply with any conditions shall constitute a violation of the respective PD ordinance and of this chapter.
(4)
City commission.
a.
Upon completion of the planning commission review of the PD rezoning application, the master development plan, individually or in combination with a final PD development plan, and any other required plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically included as part of the application, the city commission shall schedule the application for public hearing.
b.
Notice of the public hearing shall be provided according to the law for rezonings generally.
c.
The city commission shall either approve the application, the master development plan, individually or in combination with a final PD development plan, and any other required plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically included as part of the application, with or without conditions or shall deny the application. Approval of an application shall take the form of an ordinance rezoning the property to a PD district. The chapter shall identify the property by legal description, the master development plan, individually or in combination with a final PD development plan, the development documents and all conditions of approval. The ordinance shall provide that no development permits or orders shall be issued by the city until a final PD development plan, if not included as part of the master development plan, has been approved as provided in this section. The ordinance shall also state the expiration date for the final PD development plan, if applicable. The city commission may decide to deny the application. When an application is denied, the city commission shall state the reasons for the denial and indicate what further modifications to the master development plan or other submitted documents must be made for approval.
(5)
Final development plan.
a.
Following the approval of the rezoning application and the master development plan not inclusive of a final development plan by adoption of a PD ordinance by the city commission, the applicant shall submit a final development plan to the city commission for approval. The final development plan shall be deemed a development approval. The final development plan approval shall be submitted and approved by the city within two years of the effective date of the PD zoning ordinance unless a longer time is permitted by the city commission. The final development plan shall implement the master plan with all the changes, additions and conditions required and approved by the city commission.
b.
Except for any areas of the PD site set aside and designated for future development, the final development plan shall include:
1.
A designation of land uses;
2.
The exact location and dimensions of all buildings, structures, infrastructure, utilities, and other improvements, including the number and location of all parking spaces and the location and dimension of landscape areas;
3.
The location of areas to be set aside for open space and conservation areas;
4.
Open space calculations and building pad areas, and calculations on attachments;
5.
The location, dimensions and appearance of all signage, lighting, fencing and buildings and a description of all exterior building materials;
6.
A statement of the covenants and restrictions proposed to be imposed upon the use of land, building and structures; and
7.
A proposed plan of maintenance shall be provided to assure the continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions, and facilities are not to be provided, operated or maintained at general public expense. Such statements shall be approved by the city attorney.
c.
Development permits. Upon approval of the final development plan, the city commission shall adopt a development ordinance adopting the final development plan. The ordinance shall also state the expiration date for the final PD development plan, which shall expire two years from the effective date of the development ordinance if no development permits or orders have been issued to the development during that time. Two one-year extensions may be granted by the city commission upon application by the applicant.
(d)
Change or modification. Any major changes or amendments to a PD master development plan or a PD final development plan shall be processed as an amendment to the PD district zoning district under the same process as a new zoning application. Major changes or amendments shall include:
(1)
A change of 20 percent or more in the area of any land use designations shown on the final development plan.
(2)
Any change in the list of proposed uses.
(3)
An increase in residential density of 20 percent or more.
(4)
An increase in nonresidential square footage of 20 percent or more.
(5)
A change in the boundary of the PD district.
(6)
A change in the final development plan or approval regarding any areas set aside and designated for future development.
(7)
Any other change determined by the community development director to have a potentially significant impact on city services or the surrounding neighborhood.
(8)
An amendment of greater than 12 months to the originally approved time table of development.
(9)
Any change or amendment to a PD master development plan or a final development plan which is not a major amendment shall be a minor amendment. Minor amendments may be approved by the city commission upon proper application for the amendment and after a public hearing. The city commission may require that notice of the minor amendment and public hearing be given to the surrounding property owners by posting or publication in the local newspaper of general circulation.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 5, § 10)
Sec. 111-136. - Subdivision standards.
(a)
Blocks.
(1)
The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
a.
Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
b.
Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions.
c.
Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street and pedestrian traffic.
d.
Limitations and opportunities of topography.
(2)
Block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet or be less than 400 feet except where topography, property lines or other conditions peculiar to the site make such dimensions impracticable and are approved by the community development director/city commission.
(3)
In cases where block lengths are allowed to exceed 1,200 feet, easements, not less than 20 feet in width, shall be provided where needed for crosswalks and for the placement of utilities and they shall be deeded to the city for that purpose. In addition, the community development director/city commission may require the provision of crosswalks in special areas where they are deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and to other community services and facilities.
(4)
Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets or where prevented by topographical conditions or size of property, in which case the community development director/city commission may approve a single tier of lots when properly designed to meet at least the minimum requirements of this chapter. This provision shall not prevent the inclusion within any subdivision of blocks of greater width or irregular outline, including super blocks, which blocks shall be indented by dead-end roads, looped access roads, or crosswalks, to provide access to the central areas thereof, and may contain at or near their centers, public or joint use areas such as parks and playgrounds when covered by agreements as to maintenance of such interior areas.
(5)
In cases where the platting is incomplete or disconnected, the city engineer shall determine the outline of the block.
(b)
Lots.
(1)
In no case shall the lot dimensions be less than the minimum requirements of Table 111-129. Where the following subdivision standards require greater minimum dimensions than Table 111-129, the requirements of this section shall apply:
a.
Residential lots served by a public sewerage system shall be not less than 7,200 square feet in area.
b.
Residential lots served by a private sewerage system and a public water supply shall be not less than 80 feet in width and 15,000 square feet in area.
c.
Residential lots served by a private sewerage system and a private water supply shall be not less than 100 feet in width and one-half acre in area.
d.
In addition, any lot served by a private sewerage system shall conform to whatever greater area may be required by the county health department.
(2)
The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate for the off-street loading and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Furthermore, industrial lots shall be no less than 65 feet in width and one acre in area where served by public water and sanitary sewerage systems. Where either or both utilities are not provided by a public system, the minimum lot width and area shall be set by the county health department, but in no case shall they be less than the above requirements.
(3)
Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit appropriate building setback from an orientation to both streets.
(4)
Each lot shall have direct access to a public street and in no case shall any lot have less than 30 feet of street frontage.
(5)
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where desirable to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least 20 feet, across which there shall be no right-of-way access, shall be provided along the rear property line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
(6)
Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines.
(7)
Property numbers may be assigned to each lot in accordance with a property numbering system set up by the city.
(c)
Conformance to utilities master plans. All proposed subdivisions shall conform to any storm drainage and sanitary sewer master plans and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the city commission.
(d)
Monuments.
(1)
Monuments shall be placed at all block corners, angle points, points of curves in streets and at intermediate points as required by the city engineer. Monuments shall be of reinforced concrete with dimensions at least four inches by four inches by 24 inches with bronze center pins of one-fourth inch diameter and four inches length and the top six inches below the finished grade.
(2)
Lot corners shall be marked with solid steel rods not less than five-eighths inch in diameter and 24 inches in length and driven so as to be flush with the finished grade.
(Code 1993, pt. III, ch. 5, § 11)
Sec. 111-137. - Streets and driveway standards.
Whenever any persons shall construct a road or street or alley to be used by the public generally, he shall first comply with all provisions of this chapter pertaining to the development of roads and streets and alleys, and shall construct same in accordance with the standards fixed by this chapter.
(1)
Streets.
a.
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to state and/or local requirements, respectively.
b.
Where such is not shown in any street or highway plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
1.
Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas by extending to the boundaries of the proposed subdivision;
2.
Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the city commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical; or
3.
Demonstrate that the plan set forth in the design of the subdivision offers the best solution to the problem of circulation, safety, convenience, topography and service to abutting properties for the site and adjacent areas.
c.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial or connector street, the community development director or city commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in the non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
d.
Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the community development director or city commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
e.
Minor streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be substantially discouraged.
f.
Private streets and reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely placed with the city under conditions approved by the community development director or city commission. Every lot in subdivided property shall be served from a publicly-dedicated street.
g.
On intersecting streets with their centerlines offset, where it is impossible to obtain continuous pavement alignment (by offsetting the pavement within the right-of-way), the minimum centerline offset shall be 200 feet.
h.
The road pattern shall conform reasonably closely to the natural contours of the land. In order to discourage through and high speed traffic and to increase the value and stability of the neighborhood, straight portions of residential roads of undue length shall be avoided in level or nearly level areas by the use of slight amounts of curvature.
i.
When a deflection in the alignment of a street occurs, the street shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to meet the sight distance requirements. In no case shall an arterial street have a centerline radius of less than 500 feet or a minor street have a centerline radius less than 200 feet except upon written recommendation of the city engineer.
j.
A tangent shall be introduced between reverse curves on all streets and shall be designed by a civil engineer using the geometric design of highway and streets manual as published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials or other approved sources.
k.
The community development director/city commission shall have the right to reject any plan that provides for the intersection of more than two streets at any one location. A traffic circle or additional cutback of corners may be required to improve circulation and to avoid traffic hazards. Likewise, a leveling area shall be made at each intersection when the grade of the street exceeds seven percent. The leveling area should have a grade not over four percent and should be at least 100 feet long.
l.
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle less than 80 degrees or more than 100 degrees.
m.
Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a curb radius of 20 feet. The planning commission may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in the place of rounded corners.
n.
Minimum street right-of-way widths shall conform to the following:
Table 111-137. Minimum Street Right-of-Way Widths

Residential 50 feet radius 40 feet radius
  Notes:
*Lane widths include only pavement width. Example: Two lanes at 11 feet with two feet C&G would be 26 feet back of curb to back of curb.
Lane widths on collector streets and other local (non-subdivision) streets will be based on design speed and traffic volumes.
Number of lanes will be determined based on traffic volumes, except for subdivision streets which will be typically two lanes only.
Typical section details are shown in appendix B, Standard Drawings, of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(Note: Rights-of-way in excess of 100 feet shall be acquired through normal right-of-way acquisition procedures.)
o.
Half-width streets shall be prohibited except where recommended by the city engineer as being essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations and where the community development director/city commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Such portion of the street shall be distinctly designated upon the map or plat as being a portion of a street and no improvement shall be made other than rough grading until the full width shall be designated for public purposes. Whenever a tract to be subdivided is bounded by a previously-dedicated half street, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
p.
Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional rights-of-way if needed to meet the above minimum street width requirements. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing right-of-way, shall be provided.
q.
Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall be no longer than 600 feet, including the diameter of the turnaround, and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet.

Sec. 111-143. - Tree preservation.
(a)
Protected tree species and criteria.
(1)
Protected trees are those trees which warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees may be designated for preservation because of rarity, aesthetic value, historical value, botanical importance, and importance to overall community planning and size. The size or condition of trees will be evaluated by the community development director to determine if they qualify as specimen trees.
(2)
Protected tree species.
a.
Any tree native to the area which has reached a DBH of not less than six inches.
b.
Historic trees, which are those that have achieved 50 percent or more of the typical DBH for that species.
(b)
Permit required.
(1)
No protected tree shall be removed without a tree removal permit pursuant to article XIII of this chapter.
(2)
The tree protection requirements of this section shall apply to all multifamily, nonresidential, manufactured home park and subdivision developments. Building permits for the construction of new detached single-family residences, including manufactured homes not located in a manufactured home park, are not subject to the requirements of this section. Bona fide agricultural uses and operations are also exempt from the provisions of this section.
(c)
Tree protection requirements for protected trees.
(1)
Trees that meet the requirements under subsection (a) of this section and that are located within a development or redevelopment site or lot shall be protected to the maximum extent possible.
(2)
All practical measures shall be taken to leave protected trees in place and preserved within development sites.
(3)
Protected trees within parking areas shall be preserved with tree wells or other appropriate measures, if practical.
(4)
Any parking space requirement that would require the removal of a protected tree may be waived by the community development director if no fewer than 90 percent of the required parking spaces will be provided. Otherwise, protected trees shall be relocated within the project site.
(d)
Tree replacement requirements for protected trees.
(1)
Relocation. Protected trees within building envelopes or for which there is no practical alternative for preservation shall:
a.
Be relocated within the project site; or
b.
Be relocated to a site designated by the community development director.
(2)
Replacement. Protected trees, for which relocation is not possible or is not expected to be successful, shall be replaced with like species or species having the potential for comparable size, quality, and longevity.
a.
Physical. Protected trees shall be replaced at a ratio of 1:1 with respect to the DBH, for example a six-inch DBH protected tree shall be replaced either with another six-inch DBH tree or two 4½-inch DBH trees. The minimum size for replacement trees is 4½ inches DBH in order to ensure successful planting.
b.
Monetary. As determined by the community development director, moneys may be contributed as a portion of the tree replacement requirements in place of the physical replacement of trees. This tree replacement payment into the city tree replacement fund shall only be applicable for a maximum 50 percent mitigation of the required number of trees to be replaced. The remaining 50 percent mitigation shall consist of 50 percent of the required trees planted.
(3)
Relocated trees that do not survive at least two years shall, in turn, be replaced. A mechanism for financial assurance that relocated and replacement trees will meet survival criteria shall be provided.
(4)
A site plan shall indicate the preservation of all protected trees in all areas of a development site or lot, including parking areas and open space. The site plan shall show protective actions to ensure the preservation and survival of all protected trees. Tree protection shall consist of chainlink, orange laminated plastic, wooden post or rail fencing or other equivalent material. All devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing, or grading. The community development director shall inspect and approve the installation of protection control devices before a land disturbance permit is issued.
(e)
Protection during development and construction. To assure the health and survival of protected trees that are not to be removed, the developer shall avoid the following kinds of tree injuries during all development activities:
(1)
Prior to any land preparation or other development activities, a protective barrier easily visible to equipment operators shall be placed around all protected trees so as to encompass the entire tree protection area.
(2)
No attachment, wires, signs or permits may be fastened to any protected tree.
(3)
No equipment, construction materials or debris of any kind shall be placed within the protective barrier.
(4)
Required protective barriers and perimeter lines shall remain in place until all construction activity, except landscaping within the protected area, is terminated.
(5)
No fuel, paint, solvent, oil, thinner, asphalt, cement, grout or any other construction chemical or other material or tools of any kind shall be stored, or allowed in any manner to enter, within a required protective barrier or perimeter line.
(6)
No equipment shall be cleaned within a required protective barrier or perimeter line.
(7)
Injuries by grade changes.
(8)
Water, sewer, and other utility lines should be routed around the tree protection zones of protected trees. If a line cannot reasonably be routed around the tree protection zone, the line shall be tunneled beneath the area within the zone. The tunnel shall be off-set to one side of the trunk to prevent damage to the main tap roots.
(9)
Injuries by paving.
(f)
Emergencies/safety. In the case of emergencies such as hurricanes, windstorms, floods, freezes or other disasters or hazards, the requirements of this section may be waived by the city manager or his designee upon a finding that such waiver is necessary so that public or private work to restored order in the community will not be impeded or that the safety of a residence or other building is not compromised.
