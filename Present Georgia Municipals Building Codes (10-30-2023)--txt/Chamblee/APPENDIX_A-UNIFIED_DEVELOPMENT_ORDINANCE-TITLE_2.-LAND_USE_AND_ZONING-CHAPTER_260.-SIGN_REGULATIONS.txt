CHAPTER 260. - SIGN REGULATIONS

Section 260-1. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Findings. The Mayor and Council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the City's overall public welfare as well as an aesthetic nuisance.
(b)
The Mayor and Council further find that some signage has a single targeted function and identification of signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of identifying addresses, which is a benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. In addition, directional signs are used for the sole purpose of ensuring safe movement of vehicles entering and exiting property to and from public rights-of-way, private roads and driveways. While such signage may be referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
(c)
Intent of Mayor and Council. By enacting this chapter, the Mayor and Council intend to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Further the objectives of the City's comprehensive plan, which is expressly incorporated herein;
(3)
Protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens and others within the City;
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(5)
Promote the aesthetic qualities of the City;
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
Promote economic development;
(8)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; and
(9)
Promote the stated purposes of the UDO, which are expressly incorporated herein.
(d)
Intent of sign regulations. Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this chapter, any sign authorized under this chapter can contain any message, other than messages containing obscenity as defined herein, or other than a sign that advertises an activity that is illegal under state or federal laws.

(a)
Computation of sign area. In order to determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this chapter, the following shall establish how sign areas are measured.
(1)
Sign area.
a.
The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the sign area, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles delimiting each sign module, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. If a combination of rectangles is used for the measurement of sign area, rectangles shall be contiguous.
b.
For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign.
c.
For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign.
d.
For wall and projecting signs, the computation of the area of the sign copy shall include the full sign structure, including channel letters, cabinets, back plates, and any portion of the sign not integral to the structure of the building.
e.
The computation of area of sign copy for all other signs shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign copy or a sign module.
f.
Changeable copy signs. For any sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
g.
Treatment of open spaces. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign copy, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign copy, sign module, or sign structure.
h.
Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are, parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be the total area of all sides.
(b)
Multi-faced signs. For sign structures having three faces and the interior angle formed between each of the faces is 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the area of the sign shall be the largest total sign face area that can be viewed from any point in the public right-of-way or another parcel.
(c)
Location of Sign.
(1)
No sign or sign structure shall extend into or above, or be anchored or placed in any portion of a public right-of-way except as specifically provided in this chapter.

See Section 230-7 for sight distance and visibility at intersections.
(d)
Measurement of distance. Minimum distances required hereunder shall be measured along the shortest straight line from the nearest point on a sign structure to the nearest point on a property line, sign structure, building or structure to which the minimum distance requirement applies.

Section 260-15. - Nonconforming signs.
(a)
Nonconforming signs; defined.
(1)
A nonconforming sign is a sign that was lawfully erected and maintained prior to the adoption or amendment of Chapter 260, and which by reason of such adoption or amendment no longer conforms to one or more of the applicable regulations and restrictions of Chapter 260 as adopted or amended.
(2)
Any sign that was not lawfully erected in accordance with the sign regulations in effect at the time of the sign's construction, or was subsequently altered in a way inconsistent with the sign regulations in effect at the time of its alteration, is considered an illegal sign and shall not be granted legal nonconformity status.
(b)
Retention of legal nonconformity status.
(1)
A nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its nonconforming designation and become an illegal sign if:
a.
The sign is altered in any way that would make the sign less in compliance with the requirements of this chapter than it was before the alteration;
b.
The sign is relocated on the property, unless the relocation results in the sign becoming conforming;
c.
Any part of the sign structure is replaced, other than the face of the sign;
d.
The deterioration of the sign or damage for any reason to the sign makes it a hazard to public safety; or
e.
The sign has deteriorated or been damaged to such extent that repairs required to restore the sign would cost more than 50 percent of its current replacement value; provided that where damage to the sign results from Act of God or other circumstances beyond the control of the sign owner, the sign may be restored regardless of cost; in such instance, timely reconstruction shall result in retention of nonconforming status.
(2)
Nothing in this Section shall prevent the owner of a nonconforming sign from continuing to maintain such sign, nor to prevent an owner from making routine changes to the copy or text of an existing legal nonconforming sign so long as the degree of such change does not enlarge the size or height of the sign face, does not change the nature of the sign structure, and does not so alter the sign that it would require a building permit or electrical permit.
