CHAPTER 270. - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS

Section 270-1. - Purpose and intent.
Within the districts established by Title 2 of the Chamblee Unified Development Ordinance (UDO) and in other provisions and amendments thereto, there exist lots, uses of land, structures, and development features that were lawfully established before the UDO was adopted or amended, but that would be prohibited under the terms of Title 2 or future amendment. They are collectively referred to herein as "nonconforming situations."
Nonconforming structures include nonconforming buildings. An example of a nonconforming structure would be a building that was legally permitted prior to the enactment of this ordinance or prior to annexation that now fails to meet the regulations established in this UDO.
An example of a nonconforming use of land would be a food processing plant that is located in a VC district. It was legally permitted in the M district in 1982; however, the use is not permitted in the current VC district.
Common examples of nonconforming development features are off-street parking or loading areas that contain fewer spaces than required by current regulations and sites that do not comply with current landscaping or screening requirements.
Such nonconforming situations are hereby declared to be incompatible with authorized and permitted uses and regulations within the district(s) involved. It is the intent of the City to require the cessation of certain of these nonconforming situations and to allow others to continue on a limited basis until they are otherwise removed or cease. Furthermore, the City intends that nonconforming situations not be used as grounds for adding other buildings, structures, or uses of land prohibited by this Title 2 of the UDO, and that such nonconforming situations not be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 270-2. - Increase of nonconformity prohibited.
Unless otherwise specifically authorized, no nonconforming situation shall be enlarged, expanded, moved or otherwise altered in any manner that increases any aspect of the existing degree of nonconformity.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 270-3. - Determination of nonconformity status.
(a)
The burden of proving a nonconformity was lawfully established rests entirely with the subject landowner.
(b)
A preponderance of evidence must be provided by the subject landowner and be sufficient to show that the nonconformity was lawfully established before adoption of the subject regulations. Evidence must also indicate that the nonconformity has been continuous and that the situation has not lost its nonconforming status. Examples of reliable evidence include: occupational tax certificates; building permits; zoning compliance permits; city/county billing records; utility billing records; assessment, tax or rent records; and directory listings.
(c)
The Planning and Development Director shall determine whether adequate proof of nonconforming status has been provided by the subject landowner.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17; Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 270-4. - Nonconforming lots of record.
(a)
An undeveloped lot that has an area, frontage, or other characteristic that does not conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located but was legally subdivided as a lot of record at the time it was permitted may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is now located; however, any use or structure built on this lot subsequent to the enactment of this UDO and any further subdivision of this lot or combination of this lot with another lot shall conform to all other standards of this UDO.
(b)
Where land is taken for public purposes from a lot of record that was conforming at the time of such taking but becomes nonconforming due to said taking, the lot remaining shall be construed as a nonconforming lot of record. Such lot is subject to the provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section 270-4.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 270-5. - Nonconforming uses.
(a)
A nonconforming use of land may be continued so long as it is and remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
(1)
No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land or floor area than was occupied prior to the date of adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance making such use nonconforming.
(2)
Unless otherwise specifically authorized, no nonconforming use of land shall be moved, enlarged, or extended, in whole or in part, onto any portion of the lot or parcel other than that portion occupied by such use prior to the date of adoption or amendment of the zoning ordinance making such use nonconforming.
(3)
If any nonconforming use of land is discontinued for any reason for a full year, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the regulations specified by this UDO for the district in which such land is located.
(4)
Vacancy or non-use shall constitute discontinuance regardless of the intent of the owner, tenant, or lessee. Such restriction shall not apply for any period of time that such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the premises.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 270-6. - Nonconforming structures.
(a)
A nonconforming structure may be continued so long as it is and remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
(1)
No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases any aspect of its existing degree of nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be enlarged or altered if the degree of its nonconformity remains the same or is decreased, provided such structure is used for a permitted use.
(2)
Standards applicable to specific structure types.
a.
Detached single-family and two-family residential primary and accessory structures: Should a nonconforming one- or two-family residential structure or nonconforming portion of such structure be destroyed in whole or in part, by any means except by willful act of the owner or tenant, in whole or in part, it may be reconstructed, provided said reconstruction does not increase any aspect of the previously existing aspect of nonconformity and further provided that said reconstructed structure is used for a permitted use.
b.
All other primary and accessory structures: Should any other nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means except through a willful act of the owner or tenant, to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this zoning ordinance. Should such structure or portion thereof be so destroyed to an extent of 50 percent or less of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it may be reconstructed, provided said reconstruction does not increase any aspect of the previously existing aspect of nonconformity; said reconstructed structure is used for a permitted use, and; said reconstruction complies with Section 270-7.
(3)
A nonconforming structure may be moved on its own lot only if such movement reduces the degree of nonconformity or eliminates such nonconformity.
(4)
Where a nonconforming structure is moved off its previous lot, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
(5)
In cases where land is taken for public purposes from lots of record that are conforming at the time of such taking in such manner as to reduce setback(s) previously provided in relation to a portion of a structure below setback requirements applicable within the district, the portion of the structure involved shall be construed to be nonconforming.
(b)
Unsafe buildings. Nothing in this UDO shall prevent the maintenance, strengthening, or restoring to a safe condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by the Chief Building Official or other proper authority.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)
Section 270-7. - Nonconforming development features.
(a)
Nonconforming development features may remain except as otherwise expressly stated in this UDO, but the nature and extent of nonconforming site features may not be increased except as otherwise expressly stated in this UDO.
(b)
No change to any nonconforming development feature shall be made which increases the degree of nonconformity with the requirements of the UDO, but changes may be made which result in the same or a lesser degree of nonconformity, subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 270-9. In cases where land is taken for public purposes in such a manner as to reduce existing off-street parking, loading or other development features that is required by the regulations for the current district, the deficiency thus created shall be construed as a nonconforming development feature.
(Ord. No. 743 , 12-19-17)

Chapter 320, Article 3—Landscape Regulations.
a.
The Planning and Development Director is authorized to approve alternative compliance landscape plans upon a determination that one or more of the following conditions or opportunities are present:
1.
The subject site has space limitations or an unusual shape that makes strict compliance impossible or impractical;
2.
Physical conditions on or adjacent to the site such as topography, soils, vegetation or existing structures or utilities are such that strict compliance is impossible, impractical or of no value in terms of advancing the general purposes of this UDO;

Line of sight at intersections not impacted;
3.
No alternatives exist for moving or closing;
4.
The subject property owner shall pay a fee in lieu for the estimated cost to close the curb cut and provide necessary improvements (e.g.; curb and gutter, landscaping, etc.) based on the adopted fee schedule. The access easement and payment into the fund shall be accomplished prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy/completion; and
5.
The following phased approach is accommodated:
(i)
The subject property owner shall grant an access easement for the interparcel connectivity to any adjacent parcels on any block face.
(ii)
Should any of those adjacent parcels on the same block face redevelop in the future, existing curb cuts to the subject property shall be permanently closed with the installation of curb and gutter and landscaping so access is achieved from the adjacent property.
(iii)
The exact location of the retained curb cut, on either the subject or future redevelopment property, shall be determined at the time based on traffic analysis and shall be subject to the approval of the Planning and Development Director.
(iv)
When determining the number of curb cuts permitted to be retained through these phased alternative measures, it is dependent on meeting the Minimum Driveway Spacing in Section 350-2.
