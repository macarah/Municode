ARTICLE I. - HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION
A homestead of each resident under the age of 65 of the City of Chamblee actually occupied by the owner as a residence and homestead, but only so long as actually occupied by the owner primarily as such, is hereby exempted from City ad valorem taxes, except taxes levied by said City for the payment of interest on and retirement of bonded indebtedness, in an amount of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) of its value. The exemption granted to the homestead within this paragraph shall extend to and shall apply to those properties, the legal title to which is vested in one or more titleholders, if actually occupied by one or more such titleholders as a residence. In such instances, such exemptions shall be granted to such properties, if claimed in the manner required by the City by one or more of the owners actually residing on such property.
