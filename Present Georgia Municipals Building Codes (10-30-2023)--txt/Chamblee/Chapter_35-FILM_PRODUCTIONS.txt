Chapter 35 - FILM PRODUCTIONS

Sec. 35-1. - Purpose.
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for film productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as the City of Chamblee. The city is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract movies, television, and other productions to the city.
Despite the many positive benefits a film production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly-planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit.
(Ord. No. 693 , pt. I, 11-17-15)
Sec. 35-2. - Scope of coverage.
The permit required by this chapter shall be required for all movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, photo shoots, infomercials and public service announcements, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Regulation by this chapter shall not apply to amateur photographers, reporters or cameramen in the employ of a newspaper, news service, radio or television broadcasting station engaged in on-the-spot broadcasting, reporting or photographing of news of general public interest (this exception is not to include magazine or documentary programs), or productions which are conducted by the city or any city board or commission. Any film production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, film production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. No public highway, street or road shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter.

Sec. 35-7. - Film production activity standards.
In addition to the general standards, the following minimum standards shall be met in order to be permitted. Due to the varying requirements of film productions and nature of the industry, these standards are not intended to be all inclusive and additional conditions may be reasonably imposed, as warranted, to minimize anticipated adverse effects:
(1)
No permit shall be effective for more than 14 consecutive days from its date of issuance. Permits may be extended by the city manager, for reasonable cause, provided a daily filming fee shall apply. A single application shall include all locations for the same production within the city. Application shall be made no less than five business days prior to the first scheduled event or day of filming. The permit shall be available, on location, at all times while production activity is occurring and shown to city inspectors upon request.
(2)
Normal hours of activity shall be 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. daily; all preparation and wrap-up shall occur within one hour of this time frame. Noise shall be kept to a minimum and shall not violate the provisions of Chamblee Code section 34-27, Sound level limitations.
(3)
Street closure(s), obstruction or interference with normal traffic flow, including pedestrian use of sidewalks and public rights-of-way shall be detailed in the application, including any use of on-street parking spaces and/or parking in alleys or side streets.
(4)
Facilities and locations to be used for base camp, food service, and parking shall be approved as a condition of the permit; any other required permit(s) shall be obtained prior to issuance of the permit under this chapter.
(5)
The city will not intervene on behalf of any permittee or negotiate access rights to private property with property owners; the permittee is expected to deal directly with private property owners for required permission and consent. An applicant is required to obtain the property owner's permission, consent, and/or lease for use of property not owned or controlled by the city. Written permission of the property owner must be presented at time of permit application. An applicant is required to minimize interference with the normal activities of a neighborhood or commercial area, including access to private or public property.
(6)
In the event that the applicant desires to locate their production event at a facility owned or managed by the city, or on the public right-of-way, the city shall charge a daily fee in an amount determined by city manager or his designee not to exceed $1,000.00 per day. If an existing facility charge has been established by the city at a facility owned or managed by the city, that fee will be charged to the applicant.
(7)
Based upon the proposed scope of production activity and in consideration of any potential danger to the safety, health and welfare of the community, particularly private property and residents near the location, the chief of police and/or fire marshal may require on-site security (qualified private security or use of off-duty law enforcement officers) and/or may require personnel and equipment be placed on standby for portions of the production activity at the expense of the applicant. The application shall detail the planned time, place and manner of any of the following production activities: pyrotechnics, demolition, discharge of firearms or other weapons, motor vehicle chases, physical stunts, and similar actions.
