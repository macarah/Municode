ARTICLE 7. - TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 757 , adopted Dec. 18, 2018, deleted the former Art. 7, §§ 280-49—280-53, and enacted a new Art. 7 as set out herein. The former Art. 7 was entitled "Temporary Outdoor Sales," and derived from Ord. No. 743 , adopted Dec. 19, 2017.

Section 280-50. - Purpose and intent.
Traffic congestion results in a number of problems, including economic costs due to delayed travel times, air pollution and accidents. By requiring traffic impact studies for proposed developments meeting certain thresholds, the City will be better able to determine the transportation demands of development proposals and provide for reduction of adverse impacts on the transportation system.
(Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-51. - Objectives.
The City finds that requiring a traffic impact study for proposed developments that meet certain thresholds will help to achieve the following objectives:
(1)
Forecast additional traffic associated with new development, based on accepted practices.
(2)
Determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development.
(3)
Allow the local government to assess the impacts that a proposed development may have and assist the local government in making decisions regarding development proposals.
(4)
Help to ensure safe and reasonable traffic conditions on streets after the development is complete.
(5)
Reduce the negative impacts created by developments by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the development.
(6)
Provide information relevant to comprehensive planning, transportation planning, transit planning and the provision of programs and facilities for traffic safety, road improvements, transportation demand management, pedestrian access and other transportation system considerations.
(Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-52. - Thresholds of applicability.
All DCI and rezoning applications for development that meets or exceeds the following thresholds shall require a traffic impact study:
EXPAND
Type of Development Threshold
Office Greater than 125,000 gross square feet
Commercial Greater than 100,000 gross square feet
Warehouse Greater than 175,000 gross square feet
Hotel Greater than 150 rooms
Assembly spaces Greater than 2,000 seats
Residential, single-family detached Greater than 125 units
Residential, multifamily Greater than 150 units
General Any use that generates more than 1,800 daily trips
  (Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-53. - Exemptions.
(a)
A traffic impact study is not required if a discretionary development proposal is initiated by the city.
(b)
A discretionary development proposal may be exempted from the traffic impact study requirement by the Planning and Development Director if a prior traffic impact study for the subject property has been submitted to the city and the proposed development is substantially similar to that for which the prior traffic impact study was conducted.
(c)
Any development of regional impact that complies with rules of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) shall be exempt from this article.
(Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-54. - Required contents of a traffic impact study.
The traffic impact study shall be prepared following and meeting the standards of the GRTA Development of Regional Impact technical guidelines, dated January 14, 2002, as may be amended from time to time. In addition, the following components shall be included:
(1)
Existing, proposed, and needed multi-modal transportation (walking, bicycling, transit, etc.) options.
(2)
References. A listing of all technical documents and resources cited or consulted in preparing the traffic impact study.
(3)
Technical Appendix. Relevant technical information, including but not limited to: copies of raw traffic count data used in the analysis, calculation sheets and/or computer software output for all LOS and V/C calculations in the analysis, and warrant worksheets for signals, turn lanes, signal phasing, etc. used in the analysis.
(4)
Mitigation Measures and Costs. Listing of all intersections and road segments that are forecasted to be Level of Service "E" and "F" in the horizon year, or if phased, in the years that each phase is planned to be complete, and an identification and description of specific mitigation measures including signal, turn lane, or other warrant analyses as appropriate and necessary to bring these intersections and road segments into compliance with a Level of Service "D" or other city-adopted level of service for said road segment or intersection.
a.
If roadway improvements are needed, the study shall show a drawing at an engineering scale of 1" = 20' for all recommended lane configurations.
b.
If signalization is warranted by the traffic signal warrants outlined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), a warrant analysis shall also be conducted as a part of the traffic impact study. If a traffic signal is warranted, the warrant package in the study shall show a drawing at an engineering scale of 1" = 20', detailing the signal design and phasing plans.
c.
The estimated cost associated with implementing all such mitigation measures shall be provided in the traffic impact study. The traffic impact study may take into account any city/county/state-approved roadway, traffic signalization and other improvements in determining mitigation measures and providing recommendations.
(Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-55. - Additional technical specifications.
Planning and Development Department staff is further authorized to promulgate and require the use of additional technical specifications for conducting traffic impact studies, which shall be consistent with analysis methods included in the most recent Highway Capacity Manual, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, "Trip Generation" published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), and/or Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development: A Recommended Practice (Washington, DC: Institute of Transportation Engineers, 1991), as may be amended or republished from time to time.
(Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-56. - Recommendations for mitigation of impacts.
As part of its DCI/rezoning review, Staff shall complete review of the study and submit to the applicant all recommendations for mitigation measures as stated in the traffic impact study and include any interpretations or recommended conditions of approving the discretionary development proposal that will mitigate traffic impacts of the proposed development.
(Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-57. - Determination of project and system improvements.
(a)
Planning and Development Department staff shall determine which mitigation measures constitute "project" improvements and which mitigation measures constitute "system" improvements within the context of the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act of 1990.
(b)
In the event that a particular improvement is called for in the traffic impact study or recommended by Planning and Development Department staff, and Planning and Development Department staff is unable to uniquely attribute the recommendation as a project or system improvement or finds that such improvement has characteristics of both a project improvement and a system improvement, Planning and Development Department staff shall determine the proportion of the cost of such improvement that can reasonably be attributed to the development as a project improvement, and the portion of such improvement that can reasonably be considered a system improvement.
(Ord. No. 757 , 12-18-18)
Section 280-58. - Signage.
No less than 24 hours prior to the beginning of a traffic study, signs shall be posted in the general vicinity of any traffic counting devices, per the direction of the Planning and Development Department.
