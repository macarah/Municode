C.
The county's personnel administration is based upon merit principles and scientific methods governing the classification of positions and the employment, conduct, movement, and separation of public officers and employees.

The declared policy of the county shall be to establish a personnel system that shall be applied and administered in accordance with the following merit principles:
1.
Equal opportunity for all, regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, marital status, or political affiliation. No person shall be discriminated against in any case because of any physical, mental, or sensory handicap/disability in examination, appointment, reinstatement, reemployment, promotion, transfer, demotion, or removal, with respect to any position the duties of which, in the opinion of the county administrator or elected official, may be efficiently performed by a person with such handicap; provided that the employment will not be hazardous to the appointee or endanger the health or safety of his fellow employees or others;
2.
Impartial selection of the ablest person for government service by means of competitive tests which are fair, objective, and practical;
3.
Just opportunity for competent employees to be promoted within the service;

Prohibit or prevent the termination of, or change the employment of, any person who is unable to perform his duties;
4.
Affect the operation of the terms or conditions of any bona fide retirement, pension, employee benefit, or insurance plan;
5.
Repeal or affect any federal or state laws prescribing minimum and/or maximum age limits for employees; or
