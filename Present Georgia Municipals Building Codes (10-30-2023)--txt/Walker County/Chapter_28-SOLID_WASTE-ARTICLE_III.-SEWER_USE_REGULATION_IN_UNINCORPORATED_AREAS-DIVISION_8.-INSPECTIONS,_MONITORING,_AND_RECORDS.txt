Sec. 28-294. - Inspections, monitoring, and entry.
(a)
When required to carry out the objective of this division, including but not limited to:
(1)
Developing or assisting in the development of any effluent limitation, or other limitation, prohibition, or effluent standard, pretreatment standard, standard of performance, or permit condition under this division;
(2)
Determining whether any person is in violation of any such effluent limitation, or other limitation, prohibition, or effluent standard, pretreatment standard, standard of performance, or permit condition;
(3)
Any requirement established under this section.
(b)
The Authority shall require any industrial user to:
(1)
Establish and maintain records;
(2)
Make reports;
(3)
Install, use, and maintain monitoring equipment or methods, including where appropriate, biological monitoring methods;
(4)
Sample effluents in accordance with these methods, at such locations, at such intervals, and in such manner as the Authority shall prescribe; and
(5)
Provide such other information as the Authority may reasonably require.
(c)
Specific requirements under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section shall be established by the Authority, or the Board as applicable, for each industrial user and such requirements shall be included as a condition of the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit. The nature of degree of any requirement under this provision shall depend upon the nature of the user's discharge, the impact of the discharge on the POTW, the volume of water discharged, and the technical feasibility of an economic reasonableness of any such requirement imposed.
(d)
The Authority or its authorized representative shall, upon presentation of its credentials:
(1)
Have a right of entry to, upon, or through any user's premises in which an effluent source is located or in which any records required to be maintained under this subsection are located.
(2)
Have access at reasonable times to and copy any records, inspect any monitoring equipment or method required under subsection (b) of this section, and sample any effluents which the owner or operator of such source is required to sample.
(e)
The Authority, EPD, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Authority, EPD, and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
(f)
In the event any industrial user denies the Authority or his authorized representative the right of entry for inspection sampling effluents, inspecting and copying records, or verifying that a user is not discharging industrial wastes or performing such other duties as shall be imposed upon the Authority by this division, the Authority shall seek a warrant or use such other legal procedures as advisable and reasonably necessary to discharge the duties of this section.
(g)
Any industrial user failing or refusing to discharge any duty imposed upon the user under the provisions of this section, or who denies the Authority or authorized representative the right to enter the user's premises for purposes of inspection, sampling effluents, inspecting and copying records, or such other duties as may be imposed upon him by this section, shall be deemed to have violated the conditions of the wastewater discharge permit and such permit shall be subject to modification, suspension, or revocation under the procedures established in this division. A user who does not have an industrial waste discharge permit and denies the Authority or authorized representative the right to inspect as described herein subject to having the sewer service in question terminated by the Authority.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-1)
Sec. 28-295. - Reports.
(a)
Baseline monitoring reports. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing significant industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards, and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall be required to submit to the Authority a report which contains the information listed in the following subsections (a)(1) through (4) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall be required to submit to the Authority a report which contains the following information:
(1)
All information required by section 28-256(a)(1), (2), (3)a, and (5).
(2)
Information required by section 28-256(a)(6), based on a representative sample obtained immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist, or immediately downstream of the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to apply the combined waste stream formula. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with section 28-297. The report shall indicate the time, date, place of sampling, and methods of analysis and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. When an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated, this limit along with supporting data shall be included.
(3)
Compliance certification. A statement that has been reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a professional engineer indicating if pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance procedures or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(4)
Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance procedures will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the report shall contain the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide the additional pretreatment. The completion date in this schedule shall be no later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. If a pretreatment standard has been modified or adjusted, the information in subsections (a)(3) and (4) of this section shall apply to the modified or adjusted limits.
(b)
Compliance schedule progress reports. No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the Authority, including, as a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress reports to the Authority.
(c)
90-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the Authority a report containing the information described in section 28-256(a)(5) and (6) and subsection (a)(3) and (4) of this section.
(d)
Periodic compliance.
(1)
All significant industrial users shall submit to the Authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by their permit. In addition, this report shall include a record of average and maximum daily flows. At the discretion of the Authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Authority may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
(2)
The Authority, as applicable, may impose mass limitations on industrial users employing dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In cases where the Authority or a pretreatment standard has imposed mass limitations, the report required by subsection (a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the industrial user.
(e)
The reports required in this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration or production rates and mass limits where requested by the Authority, as applicable, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards or industrial permit. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Authority as alternative standards, the report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable treatment standard or permit.
(f)
The Authority may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
(1)
The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility, provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process water.
(2)
The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than 5 years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for a subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit.
(3)
In demonstrating that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least 1 sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.
(4)
The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 28-303 and must include the certification statement in section 28-312.
(5)
Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA-approved method from 40 CFR 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
(6)
Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Authority must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Authority for 3 years after expiration of the waiver.
(7)
Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and the revision of the user's permit by the Authority, the industrial user must certify each report with the statement in section 28-312, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the industrial user.
(8)
In the event a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately notify the Authority and comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection (d) of this section, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Authority.
(9)
This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
(g)
Reporting requirements for industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards. Significant Noncategorical Industrial Users must submit to the Authority at least once every 6 months (on dates specified by the Authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of pollutants required to be reported by the user's wastewater discharge permit. In cases where the permit requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the Authority to determine the compliance status of the user. These reports must be based on sampling and analysis in the period covered by the report and in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR 136.
(h)
All monitoring and compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 28-303.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-2)
Sec. 28-296. - Monitoring facilities.
(a)
All significant industrial users shall install a monitoring station of a standard design or 1 satisfactory to the Authority within 1 year from adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. All users who propose to discharge or who in the judgment of the Authority could now or in the future discharge wastewater with constituents and characteristics different from that produced by a domestic premises may be required to install a monitoring facility.
(b)
Installation. Required monitoring facilities shall be constructed, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of wastewaters. If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the Authority, it shall be provided, installed, and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's premises outside the building. The Authority may, however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right-of-way and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
(c)
Access. If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for Authority personnel. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The entire facility and any sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by and at the expense of the user.
(d)
The industrial user shall be required to design any necessary facility and to submit according to the permit compliance schedule an engineering report, including detailed design plans and operating procedures to the Authority for review in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The Authority shall review the plans and other documents within 45 days and shall recommend to the industrial user any changes deemed appropriate.
(e)
Upon approval of plans and other documents, the industrial user shall secure all building, electrical, plumbing, and other permits required and proceed to construct any necessary facility and establish required operating procedures within the time provided in the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit.
(f)
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities must be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-3)
Sec. 28-297. - Sampling and analysis.
(a)
All collected samples must be of such nature that they provide a true and accurate representation of the industry's normal workday effluent quality.
(b)
Chain-of-custody procedures, sample preservation techniques, and sample holding times recommended by EPA shall be followed in all self-monitoring activities.
(c)
Monitoring shall be performed at the approved monitoring station on the effluent sewer. Location and design of the monitoring station shall be subject to the review and approval of the Authority. Any change in monitoring location will be subject to the approval of the Authority.
(d)
All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by EPA under the provisions of section 304(h) of the Act, 33 USC 1314(h), and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by EPA or the Authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by EPA or the Authority.
(e)
Except as indicated in subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in a laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(f)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Alternately, pH compliance may be assessed through the use of a strip-chart or a circular chart over the monitoring period from a continuous pH recorder, at the discretion of the Authority.
(g)
For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in section 28-295(a) and (c) and 40 CFR 503.12(b) and (d), a minimum of 4 grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist. For facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For reports required by section 28-295(d) and 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the Authority will specify the number of grab samples the industrial user is required to collect in order to assess and ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards.
(h)
The Authority shall inspect and sample the effluent from each significant industrial user at least once every 12 months, except where the Authority has authorized an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical standard, the Authority must sample for the waived pollutant at least once during the term of the user's permit or control mechanism. In the event that the Authority determines that a waived pollutant is present in the industrial user's discharge or is expected to be present due to changes in the facility's operations, the Authority must begin effluent monitoring of the user's discharge and inspections of the facility at least once every 12 months.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-4)
Sec. 28-298. - Dangerous discharge notification.
(a)
Telephone notification. Any person or user causing or suffering any discharge, whether accidental or not, which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health and welfare or the environment, or which is likely to cause interference with the POTW, shall notify the Authority immediately by telephone. In the absence of the Authority, notification shall be given to the Authority employee then in charge of the treatment works. Such notification will not relieve the permit holder from any expense, loss, liability, fines, or penalty which may be incurred as a consequence of the discharge.
(b)
Written report. Within 5 days following such occurrence, the user shall provide the Authority with a detailed written report describing the cause of the dangerous discharge and measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
(c)
Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employers of a contact in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-5)
Sec. 28-299. - Slug discharge reporting.
The industrial user shall notify the Authority immediately by telephone of all discharges that could cause a problem to the Authority, including any slug discharge, as defined by section 28-226. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume (if known), and corrective action taken by user. Each significant industrial user shall also immediately notify the Authority of any changes at the facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-6)
Sec. 28-300. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous wastes.
(a)
Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the Authority, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 28-301. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of section 28-295.
(b)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR parts 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(c)
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(e)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-7)
Sec. 28-301. - Notification of changed discharge.
All industrial users shall promptly notify the Authority in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes, for which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under section 28-300. No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions until and unless the Authority Manager has responded to the industrial user's notice. The Authority may deny an increase in wastewater flows or pollutants or impose conditions on the increase if deemed necessary to protect the POTW from interference or pass-through. For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed substantial.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-8)
Sec. 28-302. - Provisions governing fraud and false statements.
The reports required to be submitted under this section shall be subject to the provisions of 18 USC 1001 relating to fraud and false statements and the provisions of sections 309(c)(4) and (6) of the Act (33 USC 1311), as amended, governing false statements, representation, or certifications in reports required under the Act.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 9-9)
Sec. 28-303. - Signatory requirements.
