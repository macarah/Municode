DIVISION 3. - BUILDING SEWERS, CONNECTIONS, AND PERMITS

Sec. 28-114. - Installation, maintenance, repair of sewer service lines; charge; exception.
(a)
Definition. A standard building sewer or sanitary sewer service line is a 4- or 6-inch pipe extending from the sewer main or trunk location in a street, alley, or easement to the property served by the main or trunk.
(b)
Installation of sewer service lines.
(1)
Four-inch building sewers shall be laid on a grade of at least 1 percent. Larger building sewers shall be laid on a grade that will produce a velocity when flowing full of at least 2 feet per second. The slope and alignment of all building sewers shall be neat and regular.
(2)
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where 1 building stands at the rear of another as an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as 1 building sewer.
(3)
Cleanouts shall be located 5 feet outside the building; 1 as it taps onto the utility lateral and 1 at each change of direction of the building sewer that is greater than 45 degrees. Additional cleanouts shall be placed not more than 75 feet apart in horizontal building sewers of 4-inch nominal diameter and not more than 100 feet apart for larger pipes. Cleanouts shall be extended to or above the finished grade level directly above installation point. Cleanouts shall not be smaller than 4 inches.
(4)
Building sewers shall be constructed only of 1 of the following approved materials:
a.
Cast iron soil pipe using rubber compression joints of approved type;
b.
Polyvinyl chloride pipe with rubber compression joints;
c.
ABS composite sewer pipe with solvent-welded or rubber compression joints of approved type; or
d.
Similar materials of equal or superior quality following Authority approval. Under no circumstances will cement mortar joints be acceptable. Each connection to the sewer system must be made at a tee or stubbed-out service line, or in the absence of any other provision, by means of a saddle of a type approved by the Authority, attached to the sewer. No connection may be made by breaking into an existing sewer and inserting the service line.
e.
The building sewer may be brought into the building below the basement floor when gravity flow from the building to the sewer is at a grade of 1 percent or more where possible. In cases where basement or floor levels are lower than the ground elevation at the point of connection to the sewer, adequate precautions through the installation of check valves or other backflow prevention devices to protect against flooding shall be provided by the owner. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the sewer, wastes carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged into the Authority's sewer.
f.
The methods to be used in excavating, placing of pipe, jointing, testing, backfilling the trench, or other activities in the construction of a building sewer that have not been described above shall conform to the requirements of the Standard Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and policies adopted by the Authority. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the Manager before installation.
g.
All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Authority.
h.
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, area drains, basement drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
(c)
Standard sewer stub-outs. Hereafter, as a part of sanitary sewer projects in the Walker County, the Authority shall install, or cause to be installed, standard sanitary sewer service stub-outs from mains or trunks located in a street, alley, or easement to the property line of each lot or residence on the street being sewered. In the case of sewers being constructed in undeveloped subdivisions located within a designated sewer project, the standard sanitary sewer service stub-out may be constructed to each lot as shown by the developer on the plat of the subdivision as filed in the Register's Office of Walker County, Georgia. Sewer service stub-outs will not be constructed at the expense of the Authority in a street where the property is not subdivided and undeveloped. In such cases, a fee shall be charged upon connection to the sewer line as provided in division 2 of article VI of this chapter.
(d)
Sewer tap fee. A sewer tap fee shall be paid by property owners at the time that application is made to the Authority for permission to tie on to the sanitary sewer line. The collection of such payments shall be the responsibility of the Authority. This service tap fee shall be in addition to any required fees for inspection, street cuts, or other fees.
(e)
Title and maintenance. When a property owner ties into a sanitary sewer service line installed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and pays the sewer service line charge levied in subsection (d) of this section, the Authority, by appropriate instrument, shall convey and release to the property owner all its right, title, and interest in the sanitary sewer service line so installed by the Authority. Thereafter, all repairs and maintenance of the sanitary sewer service line shall be the responsibility of the property owner or user of the sewer; provided, for all sanitary sewer service lines hereafter installed by developers in subdivisions and not by the Authority, for which no sewer service line charge is charged to the property owner, all repairs and maintenance of such sanitary sewer service lines shall be the responsibility of either the property owner, user of the sewer, or the developer, as the owner, user, and developer shall agree by separate contract between themselves.
(f)
Location of sewer stub-outs and tees. The plumbing contractor is responsible for locating sewer service line stub-outs and tees. Authority personnel will provide whatever information is available for this purpose. If a manhole needed for locating a service line has been lost, then the Authority shall be responsible for locating the manhole.
(g)
Taps on authority sewers. Where a sewer service line stub-out has not been provided, the connection to the sanitary sewer shall be made using a wye-type or tee-type connection. If no wye or tee exists within 3 feet of either side of the location shown in the Authority's records, then a tap will be provided by the Authority when the sewer main is uncovered. All taps made directly into the Authority's sewer lines shall be made by Authority personnel. The plumbing contractor shall excavate to the Authority's sewer and expose the pipe in preparation for the tap. Only 1 service line shall be allowed to be installed in a trench. A tap fee and an inspection fee shall be paid by the property owner at the time application is made to the Authority for permission to connect to the sewer line. The tap fee shall not apply where a sewer service line stub-out charge has been paid under subsection (d) of this section.
(h)
Manhole required. A new manhole will be required whenever a sewer service line larger than 6 inches is needed to tie into the Authority's sewer. The plumbing contractor shall excavate to the Authority's sewer and sufficiently expose the pipe for installation of a manhole. The Authority's personnel shall install the manhole. The cost of the manhole, including labor and materials, shall be charged to the owner after construction is completed.
(i)
Maintenance of sewer service lines. All repairs and maintenance of the sanitary sewer service line to include correction of excessive inflow or infiltration shall be the responsibility of the property owner or user of the sewer. The Authority shall be responsible for the maintenance of collector lines only up to the point where the owner's sewer service line connects to the Authority's lines. The Authority may require the user or owner to make repairs to a sewer service line to correct excessive inflow or infiltration.
(j)
Exceptions for State highways and railroads. When the installation of sanitary sewer service lines is required for sewers constructed in highways or streets owned by the State of Georgia for which boring rather than open cutting is required by regulation of the State of Georgia, installation shall be at the expense of the property owner, and the provisions of subsection (c) of this section shall not be applicable. Installation of sanitary sewer service lines in State highways or streets must be approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
(k)
Cost of building sewers. All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the building sewer to the community sewer shall be borne by the owner. All costs and expenses associated with the installation and operation of pumping equipment necessary to lift sewage to the level of the community sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the Authority from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
(l)
Service lines to enter sanitary sewers at junction; exception. No service lines shall enter a sanitary sewer at any point except where a junction has been made and left therefor unless by special permission of the Authority. In all cases where such permission is given, the work shall be done under the inspection of the Authority's personnel and at the risk and expense of the party making the connection.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 4-1)
Sec. 28-115. - Permit required to make connection.
(a)
Before the owner of any property connects such property into the Authority sewer, the owner or owner's agent shall make application to and be issued a permit (work order) by the Authority. The work shall be performed only by a plumbing contractor approved by the Authority. All connections shall be inspected and approved by the Authority.
(b)
In order to secure the required connection permit, the owner or owner's agent shall make application at the Authority's office. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the Authority. A permit and inspection fee shall be paid to the Authority at the time the application for permit is filed.
(c)
All connections to the public sewer and all building sewers from the building to the public sewer shall be inspected and approved by the building inspector before the underground portion is backfilled or covered.
(d)
The applicant shall notify the building inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the building inspector.
(e)
Connections made without an approved application may be severed by order of the Authority. Such unapproved connection may be allowed to remain active if uncovered, inspected, and accepted; however, the owner shall be required to pay an unapproved/uninspected connection fee in lieu of the permit application fee in an amount double the current regular fee.
(f)
No permit for a connection which may be used for discharge of industrial process wastes or other nondomestic wastes regulated by division 7 of article III of this chapter and which would cause the Authority to violate its NPDES permit, shall be issued except upon separate application to the Authority and approval of the discharge under the provisions of division 7 of article III.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 4-2)
Sec. 28-116. - Sewer construction; acceptance of work.
(a)
It is the policy of the Authority to construct conventional gravity sewer systems whenever it is feasible. Low pressure sewer systems with grinder pump installation and use shall be limited to:
(1)
New residential subdivisions only when the construction of a conventional gravity sewer system is not feasible; the installer of the low pressure sewer system can demonstrate that no other technically feasible alternative is available; and where it is specifically determined by the Board of the Authority to be in the best interest of the Authority; and
(2)
Existing residential neighborhoods where septic systems have failed and a low-pressure sewer system in the opinion of the Authority is more cost effective and environmentally sound than a conventional sewer system.
(b)
All sewer construction involving sanitary sewer lines, pump stations, metering stations, and appurtenances which are to become a part of the Authority's sewer system shall not be constructed until the plans are approved and the construction inspected and approved by the Authority.
(1)
All new developments will not be considered for acceptance and continued maintenance by the Authority until all the following conditions have been met:
a.
80 percent of all phases of the developments have been completed.
b.
A camera inspection of all sewer lines has been performed by the Authority.
c.
An evaluation of all lift and/or pump stations has been conducted by the Authority.
d.
The Authority has all utility easements recorded and on file.
e.
Any deficiency in the system must be repaired and brought up to the Authority's standards before the system will be taken over by the Authority.
(2)
Once these requirements have been met, the Authority will issue the developer a letter of acceptance and assume maintenance responsibility from that time forward. Prior to this all maintenance will be the developer's responsibility.
(c)
The cost of the materials and installation of gravity systems (including laterals from main to property line and cleanouts at the property line) or low-pressure systems (including the grinder pump and house lateral) which shall become part of the Authority's system, shall be borne by the installer.
(d)
Multifamily residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, tourist, and church-related properties shall be responsible for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of necessary pumps, pump basins, electrical appurtenances, and piping to the public right-of-way required for sewer service to said establishments.
(e)
Any construction work where the Authority's sewers are opened, uncovered, or undercut must have the prior approval of the Authority.
