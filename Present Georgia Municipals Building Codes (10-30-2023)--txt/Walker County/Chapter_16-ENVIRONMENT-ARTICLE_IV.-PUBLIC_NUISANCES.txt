ARTICLE IV. - PUBLIC NUISANCES

Sec. 16-485. - Nuisance prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation or other entity to cause, permit, maintain, or allow the creation or maintenance of a public nuisance, as defined or more specifically described in this article.
(Ord. 11-18-2004(4))
Sec. 16-486. - Purposes.
It is important for a community to appear clean, well kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties.
(Ord. 11-18-2004(4))
Sec. 16-487. - Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Abandoned vehicle means a vehicle, including cars, trucks, trailers, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, mobile homes, manufactured homes, or any other similar vehicle, that meets 1 or more of the following conditions:
(1)
Has been left unattended upon a highway, street, or alley or other public property outside a designated parking space for a period of 48 hours;

(3)
Has no tag correctly displayed on the vehicle or the owner cannot provide to the County Police Officer proof of insurance.
Continuing nuisance. A continuing nuisance does not have to be constant or unceasing, but merely one that occurs often or regularly, or one that occurs after a notification has been given that the activity is causing such harm as would constitute a nuisance as defined herein and/or a request for abatement has been made. Exceptions: The following shall be exemptions under this definition:
(1)
No agricultural activities carried on by an agricultural facility or operation as defined by O.C.G.A. ยง 41-1-7 within an A-1 zone shall be deemed a violation of this article.

(4)
The normal lawful activities of businesses and industries presently in existence or later established in their proper respective zones shall not be deemed to be violation of this article.
Nuisance means anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another, and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful, shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable person. Nuisances are either public or private.
Private nuisance means a private nuisance is one limited in its injurious effects to 1 or a few individuals.
Public nuisance means a public nuisance is one, which damages all persons who come within the sphere of its operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals.
