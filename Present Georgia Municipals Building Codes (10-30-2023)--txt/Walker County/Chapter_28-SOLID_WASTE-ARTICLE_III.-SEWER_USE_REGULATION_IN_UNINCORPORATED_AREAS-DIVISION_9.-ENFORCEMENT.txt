DIVISION 9. - ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 28-345. - Complaints and orders.
(a)
Should the Authority have reason to believe that a violation of any provision of this division or orders of the Board issued pursuant thereto has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur, the Authority may order that a written complaint be served upon the alleged violator.
(b)
The complaint shall specify the provision of the pretreatment program or order alleged to be violated or about to be violated, the facts alleged to constitute a violation thereof, and may order that necessary corrective action be taken within a reasonable time to be prescribed in such order and shall inform the violators of the opportunity for a hearing before the Board.
(c)
Any such order shall become final and not subject to review unless the person named therein request by written petition a hearing before the Board as provided in section 28-348, no later than 30 days after the date such order is served; provided, however, that the Board may review such final order on the same grounds upon which a Court of the State may review default judgments.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 10-1)
Sec. 28-346. - Additional remedies.
(a)
In addition to other remedies provided herein, the Authority may issue a show-cause notice to any user who appears to be violating any provision of this article to show cause why sewer service should not be discontinued. The notice shall include the nature of the violation with sufficient specificity as to the character of the violation and the date when such violation occurred to enable the user to prepare a defense. Such notice shall be mailed to the user by certified mail, return receipt requested, or shall be personally delivered to the user at least 20 days prior to the proposed action, except in the event of an emergency. At the show-cause hearing, the user may present any defense to such charges, either in person or through submission of written or documentary proof. Following the hearing or opportunity for a hearing, the Board may at the Board's discretion order termination of sewer service if satisfied from all available proof that the violation was willful, and the termination is necessary to abate the offending condition or to prevent future violations. The Board may terminate service for a period not to exceed 1 year for a willful violation and may terminate service indefinitely to abate offending conditions or prevent future violations subject to the correction of such conditions or violations by the user.
(b)
Any violation of provisions of this article that is not corrected or abated following a notice and opportunity for a hearing shall be grounds for termination of water service and/or plugging of the sewer line.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 10-2)
Sec. 28-347. - Emergency termination of service.
(a)
When the Authority finds that an emergency exists in which immediate action is required to protect public health, safety, or welfare, the health of animals, fish, or aquatic life, a public water supply, or the facilities of the POTW of the pretreatment agency, the Authority may, without prior notice, issue an order reciting the existence of such an emergency and requiring that certain action be taken as the Authority deems necessary to meet the emergency.
(b)
If the violator fails to respond or is unable to respond to the Authority's order, the Authority may take such emergency action as deemed necessary or contract with a qualified person to carry out the emergency measures. The Authority may assess the person responsible for the emergency condition for actual costs incurred by the Authority in meeting the emergency.
(c)
In the event such emergency action adversely affects the user, the Authority shall provide the user an opportunity for a hearing as soon as practicable thereafter to consider restoration of service upon abatement of the condition or other reasonable conditions. Following the hearing, the Authority may take any such authorized action should the proof warrant such action.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 10-3)
Sec. 28-348. - Hearings.

(5)
Any member of the Board may administer oaths and examine witnesses.

(9)
Upon agreement of all parties, the testimony of any person may be taken by deposition or written interrogatories.

(10)
The party at the hearing bearing the affirmative burden of proof shall first call witnesses, which shall be followed by witnesses called by other party. Rebuttal witnesses shall be called in the same order. The Chairperson shall rule on any evidentiary questions arising during such hearing and shall make other rulings necessary or advisable to facilitate an orderly hearing subject to approval of the Board. The Board, the Authority, its representative, and all parties shall have the right to examine any witness. The Board shall not be bound by or limited to rules of evidence applicable to legal proceedings.
(11)
Any person aggrieved by any order or determination of the Authority where an appeal is not otherwise provided by this section may appeal said order or determination to be reviewed by the Board under the provisions of this section. A written notice of appeal shall be filed with the Authority and the Chairperson and said notice shall set forth with particularity the action or inaction of the Authority complained of and the relief being sought by the person filing said appeal. A special meeting of the Board may be called by the Chairperson upon the filing of such appeal, and the Board may, at members' discretion, suspend the operation of the order or determination of the Authority on which the appeal is based until such time as the Board has acted upon the appeal.
(12)
The Vice-Chairperson or the Chairperson pro tern shall possess all the authority delegated to the Chairperson by this section when acting in his absence or in his place.

(1)
Violates any effluent standard or limitation imposed by a pretreatment program.
(2)
Violates the terms or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to a pretreatment program.

(3)
When any assessment becomes final because of a person's failure to appeal the Authority's assessment, the Authority may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment and seek execution of such judgment and the court, in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to appeal such assessment as a confession of judgment in the amount of the assessment.

The severity of the discharge and its effect upon the facilities of the POTW and upon the quality and quantity of the receiving waters.
e.
Effectiveness of action taken by the violator to cease the violation.

The technical and economic reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the discharge.
g.
The economic benefit gained by the violator.

(c)
The Authority Manager may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Authority.

(d)
Whenever any assessment has become final because of a person's failure to appeal within the time provided, the Authority may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment and seek execution on such judgment.

(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 10-6)
Sec. 28-351. - Judicial proceedings and relief.
The Authority may initiate proceedings on behalf of the Authority in the Superior Court of the County in which the activities occurred against any person or industrial user who is alleged to have violated or is about to violate the pretreatment program, O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-42 through 12-5-53, section 28-345 or 28-352, or orders of the Board.

(a)
Notification of violation. When the Authority finds that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the Authority or its agent may serve upon said user written notice of the violation. Within 10 days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the Authority. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The Authority is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
(c)
Show-cause hearing. The Authority may order any industrial user which causes or contributes to a violation of this article or wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner, or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued. A show-cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.
(d)
Compliance order. When the Authority finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or a permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements deemed reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(e)
Cease and desist orders. When the Authority finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, the Authority may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to do 1 of the following:
(1)
Comply with the order.
(2)
Take appropriate remedial or preventive action needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. of 12-11-2008, § 10-8)
Sec. 28-353. - Assessment of damages to users.
When the discharge of waste or any other act or omission causes an obstruction, damage, or any other impairment to the Authority's facilities which causes an expense or damages of whatever character or nature to the Authority, the Authority shall assess the expenses and damages incurred by the Authority to clear the obstruction, repair damage to the facility, and otherwise rectify any impairment, and bill the person responsible for the damage for reimbursement of all expenses and damages suffered by the Authority. If the person responsible refuses to pay, then the Authority shall forward a copy of the statement and documentation of all expenses to the Authority's attorney who shall be authorized to take appropriate legal action.
