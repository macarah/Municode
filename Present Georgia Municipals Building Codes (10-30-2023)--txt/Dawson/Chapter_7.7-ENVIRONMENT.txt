ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 7.7-1—7.7-19. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER PROTECTION

Sec. 7.7-20. - Short title, finding of fact and objectives.
(a)
Title. This article shall be known as the "Groundwater Protection Ordinance".
(b)
Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manager land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(c)
Objective. The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse affect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. of 1-11-01(1), § 1)
Sec. 7.7-21. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district.
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of city that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition.
(Ord. of 1-11-01(1), § 2)
Sec. 7.7-22. - Definitions.
When used in this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section:
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The "drastic" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharge, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low ground water pollution potential.
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas for the city are typified by those of the coastal plain. In the coastal plain, the significant recharge areas are the surface outcroppings of the large and extensively used drinking water aquifers (e.g., the Floridan, the Clayton, etc.) and soils having high permeability according to the 1976 1:750,000 Soils Association Map of Georgia.
(Ord. of 1-11-01(1), § 3)

Secs. 7.7-26—7.7-49. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sec. 7.7-50. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the state.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavation, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
The state department of natural resources and the state department of community affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of the City of Dawson, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. The objective of this article is to make the public aware of state and federal laws that protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife.
(Ord. of 1-11-01(2), § 1)
Sec. 7.7-51. - Definitions.
[When used in this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section:]
Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and storm water; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain supporting a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities.
Generalized wetland map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the City of Dawson, Georgia, as indicated on the National Wetlands Inventory Map.
Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service.
Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Silviculture means the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees.
Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or any authority designated by the Corps.
Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city which are indicated on the generalized wetland map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation".
(Ord. of 1-11-01(2), § 2)
Sec. 7.7-52. - Wetland protection district established.
(a)
Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city.
(b)
District boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdiction wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 Permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 1-11-01(2), § 3)
Sec. 7.7-53. - Local development permitting.
(a)
Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be conducted within the wetland protection district without prior review by the city zoning administrator. Proposed activities shall be reviewed to compare proposals for land disturbance or development with the generalized wetlands map to determine whether local permitting should proceed or be deferred pending a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination. All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) below shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local permit.
