--- (4) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2013-05, § 1 adopted October 10, 2013, repealed the former Art. VIII, §§ 13-150—13-175, and enacted a new Art. VIII as set out herein. The former Art. VIII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 05-01, adopted Jan. 13, 2005; Ord. No. 05-07, adopted June 9, 2005 and Ord. No. 2013-02, adopted April 11, 2013.

Sec. 13-150. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
(b)
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and reports made available to the Council and on the findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); and upon studies in other communities including but not limited to: St. Mary's, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; North Hanover County, North Carolina; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier California; Adams County, Colorado; Denver, Colorado; Manatee County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; Las Vegas, Nevada; Cattaraugas County, New York; Islip, New York; New York City, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Cleburne, Texas, El Paso, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington; Des Moines, Washington; Seattle, Washington; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); and the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission of Pornography, the Council finds:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
(2)
Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this article as adult theaters and adult dance establishments engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
(3)
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially in those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
(4)
Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
(5)
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purposes of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented business.
(6)
At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
(7)
Since 1981 and to present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency virus caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: Six hundred (600) in 1982; Two thousand two hundred (2,200) in 1983; Four thousand six hundred (4,600) in 1984; and eight thousand five hundred fifty-five (8,555) in 1985.
(8)
As of December, 2002 there had been twenty-six thousand eight (26,008) reported cases of AIDS in the State of Georgia making Georgia the ninth highest state in the country for cumulative AIDS cases.
(9)
The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reports annually has risen, with thirty-three thousand six hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982, and forty-five thousand two hundred (45,200) through November, 1990.
(10)
The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million (500,000) cases being reported in 1990.
(11)
In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the United States has advised the American Public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
(12)
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
(13)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because of activities conducted there are unhealthy, and in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and those operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
(14)
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the area of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films.
(15)
The findings in subsections (1) through (14) raise substantial governmental concerns.
(16)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(17)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the license is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(18)
Removal of the doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
(19)
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
(20)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in the preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
(21)
In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
(22)
The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article.
(23)
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(24)
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.
