Such dead end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the department under extenuating circumstances.
2)
Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the department in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection.
3)
Where a dead end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waved if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat.
4)
Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds 1,000 feet in length, a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the property boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround. In no case shall a dead end street exceed 2,000 feet in length unless approved by the department due to unusual topographic conditions or property configuration.
5.4.5 Service roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or a limited access highway right-of-way or a major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way.

5.4.7 Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the county under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the county attorney or acceptable to the department. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties.
5.4.8 Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the department of the need. In the event the department approves a design that proposes alleys, the alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street pursuant to the standards contained in these regulations.
5.4.9 Street jogs.
1)
Street jogs shall either directly align or have off-sets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential S1 and S2 streets.
