ARTICLE V. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION ORDINANCE

Sec. 46-80. - Introduction and overview.
(a)
General purpose. An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or nonpolluting flows). These nonstormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This model ordinance provides communities with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities.
(b)
Overview. It is hereby determined that:
1.
Discharges to the county separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
2.
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the Paulding Separate Storm Sewer System from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
3.
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
4.
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
5.
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county separate storm sewer system;
6.
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system.
Therefore, Paulding County, Georgia adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the county separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
(Res. No. 05-07, § 1(Exh. A), 3-22-2005)

(b)
Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the unincorporated area of Paulding County.
(c)
Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
