ARTICLE 7 - SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

7.1 - Preconstruction requirements.
7.1.1 Contractor qualifications. Contractors performing sewer line installations must be licensed in accordance with State of Georgia law and local ordinances and approved by the water, sewer and environmental services department (hereafter referred to in this article as "the department"). They should be completely familiar with the procedures and contract requirements associated with this type of project. Unsatisfactory work will cause a contractor to not be approved for future work.
7.1.2 Soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. Developers, engineers, design professionals and contractors performing work in Paulding County are responsible for following the terms and provisions of article 9 of these regulations on soil erosion and sedimentation control.
7.1.3 Easement acquisition and utility encroachment permits.
1)
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sanitary sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the department for all facilities that are to be conveyed to the department. This process must be started early enough to allow construction of the sanitary sewer before any building construction is to begin. No building permits, water meter or sanitary sewer tap applications can be issued until off-site water mains and sanitary sewers have been constructed and accepted.
2)
All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sanitary sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, ten feet on each side of the line; except, however, that when the depth of the sanitary sewer exceeds ten feet the required sanitary sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to the bottom of the pipe.
3)
Easement drawings shall be prepared for work outside the development prior to approval of the sanitary sewer plans. The drawings shall be of a size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole number and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow, land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner. Any streets or other existing easements shall also be shown. Easement agreements referencing these drawings shall be prepared and attached to the drawings, signed by the property owners, and recorded at the Paulding County Clerk of Superior Court's office.
4)
The designer shall furnish appropriate drawings for submittal to the owner of any state or federal highways, railroads, power lines, water lines, gas lines, petroleum lines or any other utility lines on which the sanitary sewer construction will encroach. The drawing shall normally be 8½ inches x 11 inches or 8½ inches x 14 inches and shall show a plan view and a profile view. The drawing will show the same information required for easement drawings. Also, the drawing will show the right-of-way of the existing street or utility, the owner's designation of the line, the name or number of the nearest intersection or mile post or tower number and the distance to that appurtenance. The clearance distance between the street surface, or the bottom of the rail, or the utility and the sanitary sewer will be shown. The drawing will show the type of material to be used for the sanitary sewer and the method of construction to be used. The drawing will also contain any other special information required by the owner of the facility on which the sanitary sewer is encroaching. Three copies of the utility encroachment drawing will be furnished with the plans when they are submitted for approval. Construction permits shall not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been complied with.
7.2 - Design criteria.
7.2.1 General. The criteria listed herein are not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the Paulding County Department of Water, Sewer and Environmental Services. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD Regulations, Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. FD-5, and other available literature.
7.2.2 Sanitary sewers separate from storm sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers only in which rainwater from roofs, streets and other areas and groundwater from foundation drains are excluded. Overflows from sanitary sewers to storm sewers are not permitted.
7.2.3 Sizing factors.
1)
The sanitary sewer system should be designed for the estimated ultimate tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed. Sewers will be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc.
2)
In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 1) maximum hourly sewage flow; 2) additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants; 3) ground water infiltration; 4) topography of the area; and 5) depth of excavation.
3)
New sanitary sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally all sanitary sewers shall be designed with a peaking factor of not less than four and this may be increased as required by the department. Peak factors will be higher for smaller basins. Sanitary sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of ⅔-pipe diameter. When deviation from the foregoing per capita rates are demonstrated, a description of the procedure used for design shall be included.
No sewer main shall be less than eight inches and no service lateral shall be less than six inches.
7.2.4 Depth requirements.
1)
Any sewers installed in the street shall be sufficiently deep to provide six feet of cover at the inlet end of all service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way.
2)
Any sewers on off-street easements shall have a minimum of four feet of cover. In extraordinary circumstances where there is no other alternative, ductile iron pipe shall be used where there is less than six feet of cover. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed, if the fill will impede the natural flow of surface water or will cause an erosion problem.
7.2.5 Slope.
1)
All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second based on Manning's Formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes that should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable (see following page):
Minimum Slope In Feet
EXPAND
Sewer Size
(Inches) Per 100 Feet
6 1.00
8 0.40
10 0.29
12 0.22
14 0.17
15 0.15
16 0.14
18 0.12
21 0.10
24 0.08
27 0.07
30 0.06
36 0.05
  2)
These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two feet per second and maintain a cleansing action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 15 percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be 20 percent and sewers shall be designed at less than 15 percent whenever possible.
7.2.6 Increasing size. When a small sewer is connected to a larger one, the connection shall be made by matching the crowns of both sewers to same elevation.
7.2.7 Ductile iron pipe.
1)
Ductile iron pipe shall be required for sanitary sewer mains:
(a)
Over or under all storm sewers.
(b)
Crossing water mains.
(c)
Under all stream crossings.
(d)
With less than six feet of cover or over 18 feet of cover.
(e)
With 15 percent or greater slope.
(f)
Inside casings.
(g)
At all other locations specified by the department.
7.2.8 Sanitary sewer pipe material requirements. The department reserves the right to disallow any manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Acceptable sanitary sewer pipe materials include Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Ductile Iron Pipe (D.I.P), and Steel Pipe and Reinforced Concrete Pipe (R.C.P.). Ductile Iron Pipe shall be used where certain conditions exist. This should be addressed at the preliminary review stage.
7.2.9 Subgrade and pipe bedding. All D.I.P., Steel or R.C.P. pipe shall have a minimum of Class "C" bedding. All PVC pipe shall have a minimum of Class "B" bedding. Wherever water or wet soil is encountered, Class "B" bedding shall be provided. If specifically designated on the plans, Class "A" or "B" bedding may be required. Typically the manufacturer's recommendations shall govern the bedding requirements of the various pipes at the varying depths. However, the department reserves the right to increase the bedding requirements for any sewer main where the department believes the manufacturer's recommendations are not sufficient.
7.2.10 Manholes.
1)
Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; all changes in grade, size, or alignment; at all intersections; and at distances not greater than 400 feet. In no circumstances will a spacing of greater than 300 feet be allowed when the slope exceeds ten percent. Cleanouts may be used only for service laterals and special conditions and shall not be substituted for manholes. Manholes in cross-country areas shall be elevated so that the top is 18 inches above grade, with bolt down ceiling lids and a vent pipe extending above the 100-year flood elevation.
2)
A drop pipe shall be provided for a sewer entering a manhole at an elevation of more than two feet above the manhole invert. Drop manholes shall be constructed in accordance with the standard details. The drop pipe shall be of ductile iron materials with mechanical joints. Also, at least one piece of ductile iron pipe shall be used on the incoming line to reach a solid, unexcavated foundation. All outside 90 degree elbows shall have thrust block poured below the elbow. Outside drop manholes will be noted on the construction plans. Where the difference in elevation between the incoming sanitary sewer and the manhole invert is less than two feet, the invert shall be row back brick, sloped from invert to invert to prevent solids deposition.
3)
The flow channel through manholes should be made to conform in shape and slope to that of the sewers. Minimum drop through a manhole should be 0.1 feet. Precast inverts shall not be used.
7.2.11 Protection of water supply.
1)
There shall be no physical cross-connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer that would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply.
2)
A horizontal separation of at least ten feet is required between sanitary sewer lines and existing or proposed water mains (measured edge to edge). Should conditions prevent a separation of ten feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches and sanitary sewers shall be ductile iron. Where sewer mains cross existing or proposed water lines, an 18-inch vertical separation is required between the two mains (measured edge to edge).
3)
Wherever possible, the elevation of the crown of the sewer shall be at least 18 inches below the invert of the water main. The two pipes shall be installed such that a full length of pipe will be centered over the crossing so that all joints will be separated as much as possible. Ductile iron pipe shall be installed for both mains at points where the two lines cross.
4)
When sewers are laid within public streets, the manholes and lines shall normally be laid along the center of the street at a depth of not less than seven feet below the road surface to the top of the pipe so that service laterals will have six feet of cover at the edge of the right-of-way. In curves and other areas where this is not possible, the lines and manholes are to be installed within the confines of the curb to avoid conflict with the curb and other utilities. Ductile iron pipe shall be used for sewer lines crossing storm sewers and at other locations specified by the department.
7.2.12 Service laterals.
1)
A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All services shall be shown on the construction plans. All service laterals shall be a minimum of six inches in diameter. A common service shall not be allowed for two or more buildings. The service shall extend to five feet inside the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten feet of the lower corner of the lot. The contractor shall install a cleanout at the right-of-way and extend the PVC cleanout to a height of three foot above the finished grade. The contractor shall also place a four inches x four inches pre-treated wood post painted green above the end of the service lateral to enable the builder to locate the service. All service laterals shall have six feet of cover at the right-of-way. Where such cover cannot be achieved, services shall be ductile iron.
2)
Six inch services shall be laid at a minimum grade of one percent. Service laterals tied directly to manholes shall enter the manholes through cored holes and shall be provided with a pre-molded rubber boot as described in this article. Laterals shall enter the manhole no higher than six inches above the table and shall be provided with a concrete flume to slope the flow into the manhole invert.
3)
The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of another service lateral. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first floor elevation at the building line. The builder shall be responsible for the location of services prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenance. The department will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction.
4)
No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for such connection, when proper permit is issued. After the service is run from the end of the lateral provided by the sewer line contractor to the house plumbing, the cleanout at the right-of-way may be cut down to a level six inches below the finished grade. The cleanout shall be provided with a cast iron ferrule with a brass screw plug to enable the cleanout to be located with a metal detector. Plastic plugs are not allowed.
7.2.13 Provisions for future extensions.
1)
Where the developer does not contemplate installation of sewers to the most upstream property line of drainage basins running through the development, a 20-foot wide permanent easement and 60-foot wide construction easement shall be required for future use of the department. These easements must be shown and recorded on the final plat.
2)
Sanitary sewer lines must end at a manhole. Stubbing out sewer lines for future extensions without placing a manhole cover at the end of the sewer line is not allowed.
7.2.14 Sanitary sewer line extension requirements. If an existing trunk line must be extended to serve the property, the developer may be required to pay all of the initial costs. If the line extension would serve other developments within a one-year period, the department may negotiate with the initial developer for a pro rata share participation from future developers who wish to connect to the extension during the one-year period.
7.2.15 Air and vacuum relief valve assemblies. A and V assemblies shall be located along sewer force mains where appropriate as determined by a design professional in responsible charge of the sanitary sewer system design. All A and V assembly locations are subject to the approval of the department.
7.2.16 Polyethylene encasement. Ductile iron pipe shall be provided with polyethylene encasement whenever the sewer line either crosses or is in close proximity to a steel gas main.
7.2.17 Easements.

Both mains shall be ductile iron pipe. At crossings, one full length of sewer pipe must be located so that both joints are as far from the water main as possible. In cases where sanitary sewer mains parallel water mains, there shall be a minimum of ten feet horizontal separation maintained between the mains. These distances are measured edge to edge.
(c)
No excavation shall be made under highways, streets, alleys or private property until satisfactory arrangements have been made with the state, city, county or owners of the property to be crossed. All excavated material shall be placed so as to not interfere with public travel on the streets and highways along which the lines are laid. Not more than 100 feet of trench shall be opened on any line in advance of pipe laying.
(d)
When possible, all crossings of paved highways or driveways by pipe line shall be made by boring or jacking the pipe under the pavement and shall be done in such manner as not to damage the pavement or foundation, unless the casing or pipe is in solid rock, in which case the crossing shall be made by the open cut method or by tunneling.
(e)
Wherever streets, roads or driveways are cut, they shall be immediately backfilled and compacted after the pipe is laid and shall be maintained in first-class condition as passable at all times until repaved.
(f)
Backfilling, compaction, dressing and clean-up shall be kept as close to the line laying crew as is practical, and negligence in this feature of the work will not be tolerated.

(k)
Construction occurring around active sanitary sewerage systems shall be done in such a way so as to prevent the spillage of sewage.
2)
All materials shall be considered as rock which cannot be excavated except by drilling, blasting or wedging. It shall consist of undecomposed stone in solid layers or of boulders of not less than one-half cubic yard. Wherever rock is encountered in the excavation, it shall be removed by suitable means. If blasting is used for removal of rock, the contractor shall take all proper safety precautions. He shall comply with all rules and regulations for the protection of life and property that may be imposed by any public body having jurisdiction relative to the handling, storing and use of explosives. He is fully responsible for filing for and acquiring any blasting permits that may be required by those agencies having jurisdiction. Before blasting, the contractor shall cover the excavation with heavy timbers and mats in such a manner as to prevent damage to persons or the adjacent property. Rock excavation near existing pipelines or other structures shall be conducted with the utmost care to avoid damage. The contractor shall be wholly responsible for any damage resulting from blasting, and any injury or damage to structures or property shall be promptly repaired by the contractor to the satisfaction of the department and property owner.

After the pipe has been laid, backfilling shall be done in two distinct operations. In general, all backfill beneath, around and to a depth of 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be placed by hand in four inch layers for the full width of the trench and thoroughly compacted by hand with vibratory equipment. The remainder of the backfill shall be placed in six inch layers and compacted to the top of the trench, either by pneumatic had tamps, hydro-tamps, or other approved methods. Care shall be taken so that the pipe is not laterally displaced during backfilling operations. The backfill lifts shall be placed by an approved method in accordance with that hereinafter specified. Backfill materials shall be the excavated materials without bricks, stone, foreign matter or corrosive materials, where not otherwise specified or indicated on the plans.
2)
Backfill under permanent concrete or bituminous pavement and as elsewhere specified or indicated on the plans shall be approved bank-run sand or gravel or crushed stone free from large stones and containing not more than ten percent by weight of loam or clay. This backfill shall be compacted to 100 percent as determined by the Modified Proctor test for the top two feet of trench and 95 percent by the Modified Proctor test from pipe bedding to two feet below trench top. Mechanical vibrating equipment shall be used to achieve the required compaction. Pavement shall be replaced immediately after the backfilling operation is completed.
3)
Backfill under gravel or crushed stone surfaced roadways shall be the approved suitable excavated material placed in six inch layers thoroughly compacted for the full depth and width of the trench, conforming to the compaction, density compaction method and materials as specified in the immediately preceding paragraph.
4)
Backfill in unpaved areas shall be compacted with mechanical vibrating equipment to 90 percent as determined by the Modified Proctor test. Backfill material from pipe bedding to ground surface shall be excavated earth free from large stones and other debris.
5)
The contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, sidewalks, landscapes, surface structures, etc., removed or disturbed as part of the work to a condition equal to or better than before the work began to the satisfaction of the department.
6)
Where sheeting is used in connection with the work, it is in no case to be withdrawn before the trench is sufficiently filled to prevent damage to banks, road surfaces, adjacent pipes, adjacent structures or adjacent property, public or private.
7.4.8 Stream crossings.
1)
The preferred method of crossing a river, stream, creek impoundment or wet weather ditch is with a minimum of two feet of cover between the lowest point in the stream and the top of outside diameter of the pipe. Ductile iron pipe is required for all stream crossings and shall extend a minimum of ten feet beyond the top of the bank on each side. Concrete collars or encasement must be provided at all joints for ductile iron pipe with less than three feet of cover.
2)
The stream bed and banks at the crossing site shall be protected from erosion with the use of rip-rap, as defined and sized in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Appendix C (Construction Materials), most current edition.
3)
Aerial crossings will require detailed plans and will be allowed only when, in the department's opinion, there is no reasonable alternative.
4)
Erosion control measures shall be installed prior to installing pipe across any stream. All work should be performed when stream flows are at their lowest, and all work should be performed as quickly and safely as possible. As soon as conditions permit, the stream bed shall be cleared of all falsework, debris, and other obstructions placed therein or caused by the construction operations.
5)
Erosion control measures can include, but are not limited to, the following items: a) silt fencing, types a, b and/or c; b) erosion control check dams; c) channel diversion through temporary storm drain pipe; and d) rock filter dams. The construction and installation of these various structures are detailed in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia or the Georgia D.O.T. Standards and Construction Details, both of which are available for purchase to the contractor.
7.4.9 Casing for sanitary sewers.
1)
Where pipe is required to be installed under railroads, highways, streets or other facilities by jacking or boring methods, construction shall be done in a manner that will not interfere with the operation of the utility, and shall not weaken the roadbed or structure.
2)
Casing pipe shall be installed at the locations shown on the plans. Unless directed otherwise, the installation procedure shall be the dry bore method. The hole is to be mechanically bored and cased through the soil by a cutting head on a continuous auger mounted inside the casing pipe. The installation of the casing and boring of the hole shall be done simultaneously by jacking. The diameter of the bore shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the casing pipe as closely as practical. Any voids that develop during the installation operation shall be pressure grouted. Each segment of the casing pipe shall be welded (full circumference butt weld) to the adjoining segment. The completed casing shall have no sags or crowns that cause the grade for any segment to be less than the minimum slope for the size pipe being installed.
3)
Excavation material will be removed and placed at the top of the working pit. Backfill material and methods of backfilling and tamping shall be as previously outlined in this article. Carrier pipe shall be D.I.P. and shall be inserted within the casing by use of approved casing spacers. Inside of casings, the sewer main joints shall be slip joint restrained by using U.S. Pipe "Field-Lok" gaskets or approved equal.
4)
The annular space between the carrier pipe and the casing shall be pressure grouted after the carrier pipe is sufficiently secured on grade to prevent floating during grouting. The carrier pipe should be filled with water prior to grouting to aid in the prevention of floating. At each end of the casing pipe, the void between the carrier pipe and casing shall be sealed with brick and mortar.
7.4.10 Sewer service laterals.

The contractor shall install a cleanout at the right-of-way and extend the PVC cleanout to a height of three feet above the finished grade. The contractor shall also place a four-inch x four-inch pre-treated wood post painted green above the end of the service lateral to enable the builder to locate the service. All service laterals shall have six feet of cover at the right-of-way. Where six feet of cover cannot be achieved, services shall be ductile iron.
2)
Six-inch services shall be laid at a minimum grade of one percent. Service laterals tied directly to manholes shall enter the manholes through cored holes and shall be provided with a pre-molded rubber boot. Laterals shall enter the manhole no higher than six inches above the table and shall be provided with a concrete flume to slope the flow into the manhole invert.
3)
The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of another service lateral. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first floor elevation at the building line. The builder shall be responsible for the location of the services prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenances. The department will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction.
4)
No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for this connection, when proper permit is issued. After the service is run from the end of the lateral provided by the sewer line contractor to the house plumbing, the cleanout at the right-of-way may be cut down to a level six inches below the finished grade. The cleanout shall be provided with a cast iron ferrule with a brass screw plug to enable the cleanout to be located with a metal detector. Plastic plugs are not allowed.
7.4.11 Setting fittings on force mains.
1)
Fittings shall be placed where shown on the plans. Fittings shall be properly braced to ensure that they will not be blown off or broken loose under the greatest possible force of the sewage flow. All fittings shall be mechanical joint with retainer glands unless specified otherwise. In situations where there is insufficient undisturbed earth to act as a bearing surface or where otherwise directed by the department, fittings shall be restrained by the use of threaded rods or other method acceptable to the department.
2)
Prior to blocking any joint or fitting with concrete, that joint or fitting shall be wrapped with polyethylene film in such a manner that the concrete will not stick directly to the pipe but that the load bearing capacity of the blocking will not be affected.
7.4.12 Bracing, sheeting and/or shoring. Whenever the condition of the ground is such that it is necessary to protect the work, the street, the roadway or the workmen, the sides of the trench shall be supported with suitable bracing, sheeting and/or shoring to be furnished by the contractor at his own expense.
7.4.13 Location and protection of existing underground utilities. It is the responsibility of the contractor to locate the underground utilities and to protect same. Utility lines or services damaged by the contractor shall be repaired by the contractor at his own expense.

3)
The contractor shall do all maintenance work necessary to keep all planted areas in satisfactory condition until the work is finally accepted. This shall include mowing, repairing washed that occur, reseeding, and water as required to produce a healthy and growing stand of grass. Mowing will be required to remove tall and obnoxious weeds before they go to seed.
4)
It is the intent of these specifications to produce a stand of grass that is alive and growing, without any bare spots larger than one square foot. The contractor shall repeat all work, including any plowing, fertilizing, watering and seeding as necessary to produce a satisfactory stand.
7.5 - Inspection and tests.
7.5.1 General.
1)
All lines designed to operate as gravity sanitary sewers and all force mains shall be successfully tested. Tests of installed piping shall be completed as described in the following sections.
2)
All piping to be tested must satisfactorily comply with these tests before being eligible for acceptance.
3)
These tests must be performed in the presence of the department's inspectors or designees in order for the test to be accepted as valid.
7.5.2 Concealed work. The department's inspectors may direct that the contractor notify the department and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, wyes, bends, service laterals or other appurtenances.
7.5.3 Minimum tests. All new gravity sewer lines constructed will be tested for infiltration, exfiltration and deflection. Flexible pipe sewers (PVC) shall be subjected to the Mandrel Test. The sewer lines may be televised if the department's inspectors cannot see through the line properly or suspects that the joints may be offset or broken. Force mains will be subjected to a pressure/leakage test. Slopes of sewer mains that are close to minimum grade will be checked to insure cleansing velocity. The department may require manholes to be subjected to a vacuum test to check potential infiltration. The backfill in the trench above the pipeline will be subjected to compaction tests as detailed below. Any defects located during testing must be corrected before construction of the project may proceed. All costs associated with testing will be paid by the developer. Tests will be performed as follows:
1)
Measurement of infiltration.
(a)
The contractor shall furnish an adequate number of plugs of the proper size and acceptable weirs to measure infiltration into the system. Measurements of flow shall be performed on any lines with a visible flow of water.
(b)
In no case will an infiltration rate of greater than 100 GPD per inch diameter per mile of pipe be allowed. Also, any visible or audible leak must be dug up and repaired. Any increase in flow between two adjacent manholes must be corrected.
2)
Exfiltration test (low air pressure test).
(a)
After completing backfill of a gravity sewer line section, conduct a low pressure air test of all pipe constructed, using methods and devices acceptable to the department. Perform such test using the following general procedures:
i.
Temporarily plug line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested.
ii.
Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure, if any.
iii.
Wait at least two minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure.
iv.
Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure.
v.
Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure.
vi.
The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown by the following table:
EXPAND
Pipe Diameter
(in inches) Seconds per
100 feet
of Pipe Pipe Diameter
(in inches) Seconds per
100 feet
of Pipe
6 17 30 85
8 23 36 102
10 28 42 119
12 34 48 136
15 43 54 153
18 51 60 170
21 60 66 187
24 68 72 204
  (b)
Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement.
(c)
Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until the inspector witnesses a successful test on each line segment.
Note: Upon request, the department may allow substitution of a water exfiltration test in lieu of the low air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to 100 GPD per inch diameter per mile of pipe.
3)
Deflection test.
(a)
Every section of sewer line shall be visibly checked for deflection. A passing section shall show a full circle when observed from one end. This may be done using mirrors to reflect sun light or by using lamps. Any section that fails this visual test shall be further checked as follows:
The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one inch of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction.
4)
Mandrel test for flexible pipe (PVC).
(a)
All PVC gravity sewer mains shall be subjected to the Mandrel Test. The procedure for testing flexible pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows. See ASTM specifications for mandrel dimensions and more details.
(b)
Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel.
(c)
During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line. (A nylon ski rope is recommended)
(d)
After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe.
(e)
Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered.
(f)
Draw the mandrel through the sanitary sewer line.
(g)
An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sanitary sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to department approval, for correcting the problem.
(h)
Retest after correcting the problem.
5)
T.V. inspection. In the event that the inspector cannot see through the line properly or conditions cause him to suspect that the line may be settled or broken or that the joints may not be made properly, he may direct that a T.V. camera be passed though the line. A video tape of the inspection will be made. Any discrepancies noted such as sagged pipes, broken pipes, bad joints, etc., will be dug up and will be corrected. Internal grouting to repair new lines will not be allowed. After connection of the discrepancies, the line will be reinspected.
6)
Compaction testing.
(a)
Compaction testing will be required for sanitary sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of five tests per 1,000 feet of sanitary sewer shall be conducted at varying depths.
(b)
The department may require additional compaction tests be conducted if any other areas where the department's inspectors suspect the backfill has not been compacted in accordance with these regulations. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well.
7.5.4 Timing of service connections. In no circumstance shall any homes, buildings or plumbing fixtures be connected to the sanitary sewers until the sewers have been inspected and approved by the department.
7.6 - Pre-treatment requirements for industrial wastewater.
Some industrial and other developments may be required to pre-treat sewage prior to discharge into the county's collection system. Requirements for pre-treatment will be determined on a case by case basis.
7.7 - Other requirements.
No part of these regulations is intended to relieve the developer of his responsibility to comply with the requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division or other appropriate agencies.
7.8 - Decentralized sewer systems, private sewer treatment facilities and community septic systems.
