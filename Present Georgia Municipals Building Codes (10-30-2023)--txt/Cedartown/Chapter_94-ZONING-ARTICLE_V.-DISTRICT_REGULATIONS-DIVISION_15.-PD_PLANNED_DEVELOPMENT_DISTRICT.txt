DIVISION 15. - PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 94-385. - Purpose.
(a)
Planned development zoning is of a substantially different character than other types of zoning. Because of the difference in character, special standards and procedures are hereby established to govern and guide the creation of planned development zoning districts.
(b)
Planned development zoning is a privilege to be earned and not a right which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the standards established in this division. The planning commission and/or city commission may require any reasonable condition or design consideration which will promote proper development of benefit to the community. It is not intended that the commission and/or commission automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density increases in the case of each planned development. The commission and commission shall grant only such increase or latitude which is consistent with the benefit accruing to the city as a result of the planned development. As a condition for approval, each planned development must be compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning district within which it is located, and each planned development shall be consistent with the objectives of the city comprehensive plan and all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations of the city.
(c)
Some specific purposes of the planned development procedures are:
(1)
To take advantage of advances in technology, architectural design and functional land use design;
(2)
To permit flexibility of design in the placement, height, and uses of buildings, open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas, and to more efficiently utilize potentials of site characterized by special features of geography, topography, size and shape; and
(3)
To protect floodplains from encroachment by development within the city.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-386. - Types of planned development.
The types of planned development are:
(1)
PD-1, planned residential development;
(2)
PD-2, planned commercial (business) development; and
(3)
PD-3, planned industrial development.
(4)
PD-4, planned mixed use development
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-387. - General standards for planned developments.
Before an application for planned development can be approved, the applicant must present evidence which clearly supports the following conclusions:
(1)
The proposed development advances the general welfare of the community and the immediate vicinity;
(2)
The plan is in conformity with the comprehensive plan and other applicable laws, ordinances and/or regulations;
(3)
The proposed development is consistent in all respects with the purpose and intent of this chapter;
(4)
The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development, and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development;
(5)
The development will not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities, such as fire and police protection;
(6)
The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, lighting, and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a planned development not used for structures, parking and loading areas, or accessways shall be landscaped or otherwise improved. The height of buildings shall be compatible with surrounding land uses as well as the general characteristics of the area to be developed and the surrounding area and acceptable to the criteria for height restrictions established by this chapter and/or applicable fire regulations;
(7)
Natural features such as watercourses, trees and rock outcrops will be preserved, to the degree possible, so that they can be incorporated into the layout to enhance the overall design of the planned development; and
(8)
The planned development can be substantially completed within the period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the developer.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-388. - Ownership control.
All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by a person or joint tenants or tenants in common. Individual properties in a planned unit development may be sold after a plat has been recorded, with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed. If the applicant of a planned development is not intending to develop the property but instead plans to sell all or a portion of the area designated as planned development or otherwise to allow a third party to develop the property, the city may reduce the standards of site approval if site specifications are not yet available with the understanding that any future purchasers or developers will have to complete the entire approval process once plans for improvement are available.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-389. - Procedure for approval.
(a)
Preapplication conference. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a planned development, the developer shall request a preapplication conference with the planning commission, to include city staff and such persons as determined by the city that may provide adequate representation for the city. The purpose of such conference is to allow the developer to present a general concept of his proposed development prior to the preparation of detailed plans. For this purpose, the presentation shall include, but not be limited to the following:
(1)
Written letter of intent from the developer establishing his intentions as to development of the land.
(2)
Topographic survey and location map.
(3)
Sketch plans and conceptual objectives regarding land use pattern, structure location and type, street and lot arrangement and tentative lot sizes.
(4)
Tentative proposals regarding water supply, sewage disposal, surface drainage, street improvements and flood control measures.
(5)
The planning commission shall then instruct the developer to file an application and advise the developer to familiarize himself with the city zoning requirements, comprehensive plan, and all other development regulations affecting the proposed development. A copy of this division shall be made available upon request.
(b)
Preliminary plan. Seven copies of the preliminary plan of the planned development and the application shall be filed with the zoning officer, who shall, in turn, forward them to the planning commission for consideration. The required procedure for consideration and approval of the preliminary plan shall be as follows:
(1)
An application for zoning amendment shall be secured from the zoning officer. The completed application shall be filed with the zoning officer accompanied by other subdivision requirements as specified in this Code.
(2)
The planning commission shall study materials received and confer with other agencies, as appropriate, and city officials to determine general acceptability of the proposal as submitted. In the course of such preliminary consideration, the planning commission may request and the applicant shall supply additional material needed to make specific determinations.
(3)
Following such study, the planning commission shall hold a conference or conferences with the applicant to discuss desirable changes in the first or succeeding drafts of the preliminary development plan and report.
(4)
Recommendations of the planning commission to the applicant shall be in writing, and following any such conference, agreements between the applicant and the planning commission as to changes in the preliminary plan or other matters are to be recorded and acknowledged by the planning commission and the applicant in writing. Items on which no agreement is reached or on which there is specific disagreement shall be recorded, and the applicant may place in the record his reasons for any disagreement.
(5)
Upon the occurrence of either of the following conditions, the planning commission will schedule the proposed plan for a public hearing:
a.
When the preliminary development plan has been approved in principal (as a whole or with reservations specifically indicated); or
b.
When the applicant indicates in writing that no further negotiations with the planning commission are desired before proceeding.
Regardless of which subsection of this section is satisfied, the planning commission must make its recommendations to the city commission within 60 days from the submission of the preliminary plan application. The planning commission shall make its recommendations to the city commission. Such recommendations shall indicate approval, approval with specific reservations or disapproval with reasons.
(4)
The city commission shall then schedule a public hearing on the matter. Within 60 days from the public hearing for the preliminary plan and respective planned development zone designation, the city commission shall approve the proposal outright, approve the proposal subject to conditions, or deny the proposal. Commission approval shall be by ordinance. If conditions are attached to commission approval, there shall be no change in the zoning map until such conditions are formally accepted in writing by the developer. When approved, the area of land proposed for development shall be designated PD-1, PD-2, PD-3 or PD-4 and shall be used only in accordance with the uses and densities shown on the planned development approved and adopted preliminary plan.
(c)
Approval and recording of final development plan.
(1)
The purpose of such recording is to designate with particularity the land subdivided into conventional lots, as well as the dimension of other lands not so treated, into common open areas and building areas, and also to define each building site as well as the use of the land in general.
(2)
The approval and recording of the final development plan may be accomplished in stages if the stages have been specified in the construction schedule approved with the preliminary plan.
a.
Upon the designation of the planned development district by commission, the final development plan shall be presented and approved in a form suitable for recording with the county clerk's office.
b.
The proposed plat (the final development plan in a form suitable for rezoning) shall then be forwarded to the planning commission for review and, if approved, shall be forwarded to the city manager, who shall make appropriate arrangement with the applicant to ensure the accomplishment of public improvements at the applicant's expense and as provided by this Code. The city manager shall consult with the commission concerning any land to be publicly or commonly owned and shall arrange for the necessary legal deeds.
c.
The final plat shall be presented by the city manager and the proposed developers to the city commission for formal approval and recording.
d.
The approved record plat shall then be submitted to the county clerk's office for recording within six months after approval by commission.
e.
No final development plan within the corporate limits of the city shall be so recorded unless it shall have the approval of commission, as indicated by the signatures of the chairman and the city clerk, inscribed thereon.
(d)
Zoning permit. No zoning permit shall be issued by the zoning officer until the final development plan has been approved and duly recorded.
(e)
Certificate of zoning compliance.
(1)
The zoning officer shall issue no certificate of zoning compliance until all utilities have been accepted by the city in accordance with the final development plan.
(2)
If all utilities, including roadways, have not been accepted by the city, the zoning officer may issue a temporary certificate of zoning compliance upon certification by the city manager that the existing public utilities are functionally acceptable and adequate for the use of the premises. Should the city manager find, while the temporary certificate of zoning compliance is in force, that the existing utilities are no longer functionally acceptable and adequate, the city manager may order the cancellation of the temporary certificate of zoning compliance and direct the developer to vacate the premises of occupants.
(3)
The temporary certificate of zoning compliance remains in effect until all utilities, including roadways, are accepted by the city, at which time the zoning officer will issue a permanent certificate of occupancy.
(f)
Changes in the planned development.
(1)
A planned development shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded final plan, and all recorded amendments shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and assignees and shall limit and control the use of premises (including the general internal use of buildings and structures) and location of structures in the planned development as set forth therein. Any deviation from the approved and recorded final plan must have planning commission review and city commission approval in writing and as an amendment to the plan.
(2)
All requested changes or revisions to an approval and recorded final plat must be made to the planning commission. The commission must determine if these proposed changes are deemed "minor" or "major" plan revisions, as hereinafter defined. For purposes of this chapter, these terms are defined as follows:
a.
Major changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the planned development, including, but not limited to, increases in the number of units per acre; change in location or amount on nonresidential land use; more than ten percent modification in proportion of housing types; reductions of proposed open space; significant redesign of roadways, utilities or drainage may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plan and supporting data, and following the "preliminary approval" steps and subsequent amendment of the final planned development plan.
b.
Minor changes. A minor change is any change not defined as a major change. The city zoning officer and the planning commission may jointly approve minor changes in the planned development which do not change the concept or intent of the development without repeating the "preliminary approval" steps. The zoning officer shall enter in detail all minor changes on the official final development plan on record with the city.
(g)
Schedule of construction. A modification of the schedule may be approved by the city commission if the developer shall present satisfactory evidence of reasonable effort toward meeting the initial schedule and justification for the modification. If construction falls more than one year behind schedule, as determined by the city engineer, and the developer fails to justify the delay to the commission's satisfaction, commission may proceed to complete all or any part of such improvements and recover the costs thereof by laying claim to the guarantee specified in section 94-394.
(h)
Effect of denial of a planned development.
(1)
If an application for a planned development is denied wholly or partly, then for a period of one year from the date of submission thereof, the planning commission need not consider any resubmission therefore.
(2)
If a preliminary development plan is approved and the final development plan is thereafter disapproved, the applicant, or his successor in interest, may at any time submit one or more new versions of the final development plan, so long as the new versions are in full compliance with the approved preliminary development plan, including any conditions attached to said plan.

Sec. 94-390. - PD-1 planned residential development.
(a)
Policies guiding development. This district is intended to provide flexibility in the arrangement and design of residential dwellings, based upon a unified development plan conceived and carried out for an entire area. Within this district, appropriate and reasonable population density is maintained while a variety of dwelling unit types is encouraged. Natural features such as topography, trees and drainageways are encouraged to remain in their natural state to the degree possible. Such developments are generally characterized by a significant proportion of usable open space and a unified design concept with particular attention devoted to the periphery of the development, the overall objective being the compatibility of the development with its surroundings.
(b)
Permitted uses.
(1)
Permitted uses are those included as permitted, conditional and accessory uses in all residential zones, as established by this chapter.
(2)
Convenience establishments as conditional uses are those established as necessary for the proper development of the community and to be so located, designated and operated to serve primarily the needs of the persons within the planned development plot. Uses shall be generally limited to those uses permitted in the C-1 and C-2 districts, with no direct access or advertising signs for such uses to be visible from the exterior of the development. Such convenience establishments and their parking areas shall not occupy more than five percent of the total area of the development. No separate building or structure designed or intended to be used, in whole or in part, for business purposes shall be constructed within a residential planned development until not less than 30 percent of the dwelling units proposed in the development plan are certified for occupancy.
(c)
Area requirements. The minimum land area required for a planned residential development shall be five acres. This area requirement may be reduced at the discretion of the planning commission and city commission if it can be demonstrated that a waiver is necessary to achieve an improved site design and that surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities will not be adversely affected.
(d)
Density requirements. Any combination or cluster of housing units is permitted, provided that the average lot area per family or dwelling unit contained in the site, exclusive of the area of street rights-of-way, parking areas and commercial areas, must be at least 80 percent of the average lot area per family required in the surrounding nonagricultural districts. This density requirement may be varied at the discretion of the planning commission and city commission if it can be demonstrated that a waiver is necessary to achieve an improved site design and that surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities will not be adversely affected.
(e)
Site design.
(1)
All housing shall be sited to preserve privacy and to ensure natural light.
(2)
Lot widths may be varied to permit a mixture of structural designs. Varied setback is encouraged.
(3)
Where feasible, housing units should be situated to abut common open space or similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is encouraged.
(f)
Structure spacing. A minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between principal structures.
(g)
Length. There shall be no continuous structure of townhouses, attached dwellings or apartments containing more than 12 dwelling units on ground floor level.
(h)
Height. The building height of any residential structure within a planned development shall not exceed 45 feet or three and one-half stories. However, the planning commission may grant an exception if it is demonstrated that additional height can be achieved with concurrent expansion of suitable open space to protect adjacent structures from adverse reduction of light and air.
(i)
Setback and screening. A minimum setback of 50 feet shall be provided along the entire perimeter of the development and retained in natural woods, or be suitably landscaped with grass and/or ground cover, shrubs and trees. Projects located adjacent to commercial or industrially zoned areas shall provide suitable screening to the residential development as adjudged by the planning commission. Screening shall not obscure traffic visibility within 50 feet of an intersection.
(j)
Common open space.
(1)
A minimum of 25 percent of the total land in any planned residential development shall be reserved for permanent common open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed. In extreme topographical conditions, at the discretion of the planning commission, this requirement may be reduced.
(2)
Only area having minimum dimensions of 50 feet by 100 feet shall qualify for computation as usable open space.
(k)
Parking requirements. A minimum of two spaces per unit, with two extra spaces for each building with multiple units.
(l)
Signs. Permitted sizes and locations of signs within the PD-1 development shall be in compliance with the standards established in article III of chapter 5.
