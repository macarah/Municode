(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-132. - Lot regulations.
(a)
Substandard lots. Any residentially zoned lot which was of record at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived that does not meet the requirements of this chapter for yards or other area or open space may be utilized for single residence purposes, provided that:
(1)
In the absence of the ability to connect to the wastewater treatment system due to the unavailability of city sewer connection, the lot can meet the requirements of the county health department for the installation of a septic tank.
When a subdivision of land or portion thereof contains lots or parcels of land that do not conform to the lot area or lot frontage provisions of this article and such tract of land is under one ownership and has remained unimproved or undeveloped for a period of two years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, it shall be incumbent upon the owner of such tract to replat the tract to conform to the minimum area and frontage provisions of this article for the district in which the lands are located, in the event of a sale of any portion of the land.
(b)
Lot reduction below minimum requirements prohibited. No parcel of land, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth, front, side, or rear yard, inner or outer courts, lot area per unit, or other requirements of this chapter are not maintained. This subsection shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public use.
(c)
Lot size. All lots shall conform to the area requirements set forth in the zoning districts in which they are located. Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to permit appropriate building setbacks from, and orientation to, both abutting streets.
(d)
Building lines. A building line meeting the front, rear and side yard setback requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel of land is located shall be established on all lots.
(e)
Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots should be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. When allowed, a strip of land at least 20 feet in width, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the lot or line of lots abutting such traffic artery.
(f)
Lot required to abut public street. No building or structure shall be erected on a lot or portion of a lot which does not abut on a public street for at least 25 feet.
(g)
Access to public streets. Access to public streets shall be maintained in accordance with a minimum 25-foot frontage on a public street.
(h)
Inspection permit requirements. To ensure the provisions of this chapter are complied with by the petitioner, no building, structure or site alterations shall be allowed to commence on a lot or portion of a lot before a building permit is obtained from the city.
(i)
[Lots at intersections.] On lots having frontage on more than one street at an intersection, the minimum front yard requirement may be reduced to one-half the regulated distance on the portion of the lot fronting on the street or streets of less importance. However, in no case shall the setback be reduced to less than 25 feet. The minimum front yard for the portion of the lot fronting on the street of greater importance shall be provided in accordance with the provisions established by this ordinance for the district in which the lot is located. For purposes of establishing the front yard, such yard shall be designated as that having the shortest frontage on the street.

(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-141. - Buffer areas and screeningโVariance.
(a)
Purpose; when required. The use of buffer areas and screening reduces potential incompatibility between or among different uses of land in proximity to each other. Where the city determines that a proposed use of land or the granting of a variance from the requirements of this chapter would have an unfavorable impact on an adjoining use, or the granting of a permit for such use or variance, a permanent buffer area or screening will be established.
(b)
Buffer area formation and maintenance. Buffer areas, when required, shall be established and permanently maintained under the following provisions:
(1)
Be maintained as a planted area (or landscaped berm), using existing vegetation, or, when required, additional plantings as provided in this subsection;
(2)
Be in such dimension as the city may determine necessary, but in no event less than 20 feet measured at right angles to property lines contiguous to the designated property line(s);
(3)
Be landscaped with trees, shrubs, flowers, grass, stone, rocks and other landscaping materials; landscaping plants shall be composed of healthy plants which possess growth characteristics of such a nature so as to produce a dense compact planting screen of not less than six feet in height;
(4)
Be free of structures other than a fence, and not be used for parking, utility easements, or drainage improvements, unless the applicant can demonstrate that these improvements are necessary;
(5)
The natural topography of the land shall be preserved and natural growth shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, with commission approval, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion. This easement may cover no more than 20 percent of the required buffer area, and shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvement; and
(6)
Where, by reason of the topography of the land or by reason of the prior removal or lack of timber and foliage, the owner of the buffer area may be required to erect a permanent wall or fence of not less than six feet in height or screen of evergreen plantings, so designed and developed to provide visual screening. These plantings shall consist of evergreen shrubs that will, with normal growth, attain a height of six feet within three years.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-142. - Additional greenscaping/landscaping requirements.
PURPOSE
It is the purpose of these provisions to provide environmentally sound landscape amenities and buffers which promote a positive community image by promoting quality development, enhancing property values, providing for landscape improvements in the city and promoting orderly growth and aesthetic quality in the city. It is also the intent to promote a healthy, natural environment whenever possible by protecting and enhancing existing vegetation.
Landscaping enhances a community's environmental and visual character and improves the overall quality of life. Vegetation can also improve air and water quality, reduce soil erosion, reduce noise and glare, provide habitat for wildlife, moderate the climate and enhance property values, thus protecting the health, safety and welfare of the community.
However, inappropriate landscaping can degrade the quality of the natural environment by requiring excess water and pesticides, or by creating unnecessary conflicts with sewers, sidewalks and vehicle access. Thus it is important to promote environmentally sound landscaping, including the use of low-maintenance, drought-resistant and native or noninvasive plants, and to ensure that the right tree is planted in the right place. Environmentally sound landscaping also means prohibiting the use of invasive and potentially invasive species. Although well-mannered non-native species can be welcomed additions to a landscape, invasive species can cause severe economic and environmental harm (including crop damage and degradation of native habitats) and can engender significant control costs.
These provisions also establishes additional standards for buffers between certain uses. Buffers between two incompatible uses minimize harmful impacts such as transmission of noise, dust and glare. Buffers can also lessen visual pollution, establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, and thus protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community. The presence of trees and other vegetation aids in storm water management, helps to prevent erosion, improves air quality, conserves energy, provides wildlife habitat and preserves and enhances property values.
Additionally, this article is intended to require the landscaping of new parking lots in order to reduce the harmful effects of wind and air turbulence, heat and noise, and the glare of motor vehicle lights; to prevent soil erosion; to provide shade; and to enhance the appearance of parking lots.
DEFINITIONS

APPLICABILITY
For parking lots of five spaces or more, the developer shall provide landscaping along the street right-of-way(s) to which the property has frontage, the parking lot perimeter and the parking lot interior as specified in this article.
Developers of new, nonresidential buildings shall provide landscaping between the building and the street right(s)-of-way to which the property has frontage, as specified in this article. Buffers and screening shall also be provided in accordance with this article.
No land use permit or building permit shall be issued, and it shall be unlawful to commence development or construction, until it is determined that the proposed development or building is in conformance with the provisions of the article, as applicable.
LANDSCAPE ADJACENT TO STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY
One of the following five planting specifications shall apply to all parking lots established after the adoption of this article. The applicant may choose but shall comply with one of the five following options for landscaping adjacent to the public right of way. The landscape requirement shall not apply to vehicle access areas and shall not include any other paved surfaces with the exception of pedestrian sidewalks or trails and areas approved for stormwater management. The topography of a particular site may necessitate the use of a combination of options along a given length of frontage.
Option 1. Minimum ten-foot wide landscape strip, planted with a minimum of one shade tree and ten shrubs per 35 linear feet of street frontage, excluding driveway openings (Figure 4-5-1).
Option 2. An earth berm at least 2.5 feet higher than the finished elevation of the parking lot, with one shade tree and five shrubs for every 35 linear feet of frontage (Figure 4-5-3).
Option 3. A six-foot landscaped strip with a minimum three-foot grade drop from the right-of-way to the parking lot. One shade tree and five shrubs are required for every 35 linear feet (Figure 4-5-3).
Option 4. A three-foot high fence of brick, stone, or finished concrete wall, with a four-foot buffer strip, planted with a minimum of one shade tree per 35 linear feet of frontage (Figure 4-5-4).
Option 5. If existing woodlands are determined by the arborist to be sufficient to meet the intent of this article, the applicant may preserve a 25-foot wide natural buffer strip to satisfy the requirements of this Code subsection (Figure 4-5-5).
PARKING LOT LANDSCAPE ALONG OTHER PROPERTY LINES
Along all property lines not abutting a street right-of-way, or along the perimeter of the developed portion of the lot in case the development does not extend to a property line, parking lots subject to the requirements of this subsection shall include a perimeter landscape strip at least five feet wide. The perimeter landscape strip shall not apply to interparcel access points but shall not include any other paved surfaces with the exception of pedestrian sidewalks or trails and areas approved for stormwater management. Within the perimeter landscape strip, the applicant shall install one tree and three shrubs for each 35 linear feet of property boundary along the perimeter to which this Code subsection applies, unless the Arborist approves the use of existing woodlands or other vegetation as meeting the intent of this article. See Figure 4-5-6.
PARKING LOT INTERIOR LANDSCAPING
Interior lot landscaping shall be required for any parking lot subject to the requirements of this article. An interior parking lot landscape island at least nine feet wide (Figure 4-5-7) and at least 150 square feet in area shall be provided for every ten spaces in each row of parking spaces abutting the perimeter or within the interior of the parking lot. Within each interior parking lot landscape island, a minimum two-inch caliper tree shall be required to be planted and maintained.
LANDSCAPE BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY
A landscape strip shall be required along the entire building frontage of any office, institutional, commercial or industrial building located within 50 feet of a street right-of-way, between said building and the street right-of-way, except for approved pedestrian and vehicle access areas.

  SCREENING AND BUFFER SPECIFICATIONS
Screening shall be established within all buffers that are required by this Code, along side and rear lot lines. The arborist may require additional screening outside landscape strips and buffers that are required along side and rear lot lines, for purposes of obscuring features such as rear entrances, utility and maintenance structures, and loading facilities. Landscaping shall be used whenever possible to screen objectionable views, noises, or nuisances, such as service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, transformers, etc.
All required screening shall consist of shrubs and/or trees but may be supplemented with walls, fences or earth berms. Screening shall be of such nature and density to screen activities on the lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting lot and shall provide year-round maximum opacity from the ground to a height of at least six feet. Trees and shrubs shall be installed to not only provide maximum opacity, but to allow for proper plant growth and maintenance.
To achieve maximum opacity within buffers, the following alternatives, or combination thereof, shall be considered by the applicant and applied, subject to the approval of the arborist:
(a)
Six-foot-high evergreen screening shrubs planted four (4) feet on center.
(b)
Tall evergreen trees stagger-planted with branches touching ground.
(c)
Combination of small shrubs planted 30 inches on center, small trees planted 30 feet on center, and large trees planted 40 feet on center.
(d)
Six-foot-high masonry wall.
In selecting materials and the size of plantings to be installed, the applicant and the Arborist shall consider the purpose of the landscape and the following required materials:

Visual relief/shade in parking areas Trees, ground cover, decorative mulch, pavers
  GENERAL PROVISIONS
Visibility. Landscaping shall not restrict visibility of motorists or pedestrians (e.g., tall shrubs or low-lying branches of trees).
Clearance. Trees must have a clear trunk at least six feet above finished grade to allow a safe clearance beneath the tree, except as otherwise provided by this Code section.
Curb stops. A curb or wheelstop shall be provided along interior parking lot landscape islands, perimeter landscape strips, and landscapes adjacent to street rights-of-way, to prevent cars from encroaching on trees, shrubs, and landscapes, as approved by the Arborist.
LANDSCAPE PLAN
A landscaping plan approved by the arborist shall be required prior to the issuance of a land use permit or building permit to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Code. The landscape plan shall be based on an accurate boundary survey of the site or reasonable property description and shall include the following:
(a)
Location and general type of existing vegetation;
(b)
Existing vegetation to be saved;
(c)
Methods and details for protecting existing vegetation during construction;
(d)
Locations and labels for all proposed plants and a plant list or schedule showing the proposed and minimum required quantities;
(e)
Location and description of other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, and courts or paved areas.
APPROVAL OF LANDSCAPING AND OTHER MATERIALS
Approval of all landscaping and other materials by the arborist shall be required. The arborist shall have broad discretion in approving the specific types of landscaping and other materials provided in the landscape requirements of this Code section. However, the following general guidance is provided and specific lists of approved species are provided in this Code:
(a)
The use of native plants as landscaping materials is encouraged wherever possible.
(b)
Invasive or potentially invasive plants are not permitted. However, well-mannered non-native plants are acceptable if they are not considered invasive or potentially invasive.
(c)
Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be preserved, whenever possible, or replaced with suitable vegetation.
(d)
Ground cover(s) should be used to supplement landscaping in appropriate areas to reduce the need for extensive grass lawns, which would require regular watering in drought conditions.
(e)
Grass areas shall be sodded. However, if grass seed must be used, it shall be a variety suitable to the area that produces complete coverage.
(f)
No artificial plants, trees, or other vegetation shall be installed.
TREE PLANTING GUIDELINES
(a)
[Acceptable trees.] Only healthy trees with a well-developed root system and a well-formed top, characteristic of the species, should be planted.
(b)
[Compatibility.] Trees selected for planting must be compatible with the specific site conditions.
(c)
[Planting times.] The ability of a species to regenerate a new root system and to become re-established should be considered. Generally, deciduous trees should be planted in the fall after leaf drop, or in early spring before bud break. There are indications that bare-root trees will re-establish more readily if planted in early spring just prior to bud break.
(d)
[Depth.] Trees should not be planted deeper than they were in their former location or container.
(e)
[Backfill.] Once the transplanted tree is set, the hole should be backfilled with soil of good texture and structure. Backfill material should be comprised of a mix of native soil, organic matter such as peat, and inorganic material such as pearlite or vermiculite in a 1:1:1 ratio, although a backfill with native soil alone may be adequate.
(f)
[Fertilizer.] The addition of fertilizer to backfill soil can cause root injury and is therefore not recommended. If fertilizer must be added, a small amount should be used. Approximately 1.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of back fill is recommended for bare root plants, and 2.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of back fill for balled and burlapped trees.
(g)
[Settling.] The backfill should be gently tamped (but not compacted) and soaked for settling. The soil should be slightly mounded to allow for settling; a ridge or dike around the perimeter of the hole can facilitate watering.
(h)
Pruning. The amount of pruning necessary for newly planted trees depends upon the trees' response to planting. A decrease in leaf surface area from pruning can result in a reduction of the production of food, thus ultimately inhibiting root development. Pruning for vigor or to train young trees should therefore be delayed until after the first growing season.
(i)
[Staking.] Staking should be used on newly planted trees only where determined necessary. The extent of staking will depend upon tree strength, form and condition at planting, expected wind conditions, the amount of vehicle or foot traffic and the level of followup maintenance. Staking can cause tree damage. Periodic followup inspections are required to prevent serious tree-staking problems. Staking should be removed as soon as the tree is capable of providing its own anchorage and support.
(j)
[Mulching.] Mulching newly planted trees will reduce competition from weeds and moderate soil moisture and temperature extremes.
(k)
[Injury, etc.] Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease or nutritional disorders.
(l)
[Root defects.] Trees selected for planting must be free of root defects.
LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE AND LANDSCAPE BOND
The owner, occupant, tenant and respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection of all landscaping required to be installed pursuant to this Code. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer or owner shall post a performance bond or cash escrow guaranteeing all landscaping materials and work for a period of two years after approval or acceptance thereof by the city in a sum established by the Arborist. The bond will be in the amount of 100 percent of the estimated cost of replacing all of the landscaping required by these specifications, unless otherwise specified by the arborist. At the end of two years, the arborist shall make an inspection and notify the owner or developer and the bond company of any corrections to be made. If no maintenance is required, or if maintenance is provided by said responsible party, the arborist shall release the bond.
