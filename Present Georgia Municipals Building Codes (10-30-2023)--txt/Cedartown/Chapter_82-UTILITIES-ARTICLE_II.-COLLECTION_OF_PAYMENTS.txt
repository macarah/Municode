ARTICLE II. - COLLECTION OF PAYMENTS

Sec. 82-21. - General charges for utility services.
All persons shall pay for all utility services (water, sewer, garbage, collection and related services) based upon the rate of charges set for such services by the city commission, through its determination of the rate of charges, schedule of fees and related matters necessary to operate such services for the city. All revenues derived therefrom shall be used for the operation, maintenance, debt retirement and other authorized expenses of the utility systems of the city. These rates of charge are approved annually during the budget process, designated as rates of charge for such service, and are incorporated as part of this section by reference. Any taxes or charges as approved by the City of Cedartown Commission in the schedule of fees and charges shall constitute a lien on the property served by said utility services.

(a)
Bills to customers for utilities shall be mailed out on such day or days of each month as may be determined as desirable by the city. Bills shall be paid at the city hall.
(b)
Failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from becoming delinquent nor relieve the consumer from payment of same.
(c)
The failure of utility users to timely pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the following penalties:
(1)
Nonpayment after the tenth of the month following the bill date will be subject to a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent account charges.
(2)
The past due amount must be paid before the 25th of the month to avoid a delinquent payment fee and/or disconnection of service.

Sec. 82-23. - Disconnection of service; reinstatement.
(a)
Pursuant to subsection 82-22(c)(2) above, if an account remains delinquent 30 days from the date due, services shall be discontinued. Notice of discontinuance of service shall be made on the premises at the time of the disconnection. The city shall have the authority to assign delinquent accounts to a collection agency and may otherwise utilize any legal remedies available to improve collection of delinquent accounts.
(b)
Service disconnected for nonpayment of bills will be restored only after bills are paid in full, such security deposit or additional security deposit as may be required by the city manager and a reconnection fee as approved by the City of Cedartown Commission in the schedule of fees and charges is paid for each meter reconnected.
(c)
Upon discontinuance of service for nonpayment of bills, in the event reconnection is not requested within 30 days, the security deposit will be applied by the city toward settlement of the account. Any balance will be refunded to the consumer; however, if the security deposit is insufficient to cover the bill, the city may proceed to collect the balance in the usual way provided by law for collection of debts.
(d)
When service is disconnected, the service technician shall record the water meter reading and lock the meter. When service is reconnected, the service technician shall verify that the usage indicated on the meter is consistent with the reading at the time service was discontinued. If there is an increase in water usage, the water service supervisor shall issue a citation for interference with utility property pursuant to section 82-1 of this Code. An additional restoration penalty shall be charged as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. Water service will not be restored until this penalty is paid in full.
