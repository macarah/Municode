ARTICLE VII. - COMMERCIAL WASTE

Sec. 50-145. - Purpose.
Excessive amounts of fats, oils and grease, grit, sand and other solid or viscous materials can cause blockage and obstruction in the sanitary sewer system, causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the environment.

This article sets forth minimum and uniform requirements for the treatment and disposal of commercial waste into the sanitary sewer system, and the transportation and ultimate disposal of commercial waste sludge and byproducts.
The objectives of this article are:
• To minimize the discharge of pollutants associated with commercial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system that may interfere with normal operation of the system, and
• To assure that the sludge and byproducts removed from commercial waste treatment systems are transported and disposed of in accordance with chapter 391-3-6-.24 of the rules and regulations of the state department of natural resources, environmental protection division.
