Chapter 69 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 69-1. - Stormwater management facility requirements; plans required.
(a)
For purposes of this chapter, "development" shall mean any land-disturbing activity greater than one-third acre or any building additions on commercial and/or industrial structures. The need for and approval of detention facilities in a residential land subdivision, commercial development, or industrial development will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the city engineer or his authorized representative. When the city engineer determines that such a facility is necessary and appropriate, developers shall hereby be required to provide retention and/or detention when rate of runoff of pre-development conditions is increased one percent or greater by post development conditions. It shall be the duty of an owner intending to develop land for residential, commercial and industrial purposes to prepare and submit to the city engineer for a review a stormwater management plan prior to engaging in any land-disturbing activities. No land-disturbing activities shall begin until the city engineer has approved this plan. Each developer's stormwater management plan will be prepared by a professional engineer or a land surveyor licensed by the state who will certify that the design meets minimum standards (≤ one percent) and will serve the intended purpose. A road-grading plan shall also be submitted as an integral part of the drainage plan.
(b)
A currently accurate topographic map of the entire development with two-foot contours will be provided to the city manager and city engineer by the developer showing the routing of water upon its entrance to and exit from the development for both pre- and post development. The developer's designer (engineer and surveyor) shall delineate and label the 100-year flood plain elevation.
(c)
Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than one percent over that which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions. This shall be provided for the two-year, 25-year, 50-year, and 100-year frequency storm levels.

The inspection and maintenance agreement, if applicable, must be approved by the city manager or his/her designee prior to plan approval, and recorded in the deed records upon final plat approval.
The inspection and maintenance agreement shall identify by name or official title the person(s) responsible for carrying out the inspection and maintenance. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management facility or practice, unless assumed by a governmental agency, shall remain with the property owner and shall pass to any successor owner. If portions of the land are sold or otherwise transferred, legally binding arrangements shall be made to pass the inspection and maintenance responsibility to the appropriate successors in title. These arrangements shall designate for each portion of the site, the person to be permanently responsible for its inspection and maintenance.
As part of the inspection and maintenance agreement, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often routine inspection and maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility or practice. The agreement shall also include plans for annual inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled maintenance and shall also include remedies for the default thereof.
In addition to enforcing the terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city manager or his/her designee may also enforce all of the provisions for ongoing inspection and maintenance in section 69-50.
The city manager or his/her designee, in lieu of an inspection and maintenance agreement, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this ordinance and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
(e)

(Ord. No. 9-2011, § 3, 8-8-11; Ord. No. 7-2019 , § 2(Exh. A), 12-9-19)
Sec. 69-48. - Postdevelopment stormwater management performance criteria.
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article:
(a)
Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(1)
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
(2)
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and,
(3)
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city manager or his/her designee are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
(b)
Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
(1)
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer;
(2)
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
(3)
Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control.
(c)
Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the postdevelopment peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided.
(d)
Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(e)
Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city manager or his/her designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city manager or his/her designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question.
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.
(f)
Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (a). The applicant may, if approved by the city manager or his/her designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.
(g)
Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual;
(2)
All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and,
(3)
Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual.
(h)
Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
