The decision to relocate said facilities in order to accommodate the city's improvements shall be made by the development services director upon review of the location and construction of the franchisee's facilities.
If the development services director determines that the project necessitates the relocation of the franchisee's then existing facilities, the city shall: within a reasonable time, which shall be no less than 30 days, prior to the commencement of such improvement project, provide the franchisee with written notice requiring such relocation.

In the event of an emergency as described herein, the franchisee shall relocate its facilities within the time period specified by the development services director.
The franchisee may, after receipt of written notice requesting a relocation of its facilities, submit to the city written alternatives to such relocation. The city shall evaluate such alternatives and advise the franchisee in writing if one or more of the alternatives is suitable to accommodate the work, which would otherwise necessitate relocation of the facilities. If so requested by the city, the franchisee shall submit additional information to assist the city in making such evaluation. The city shall give each alternative proposed by the franchisee full and fair consideration, within a reasonable time, so as to allow for the relocation work to be performed in a timely manner.
