DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 94-425. - Limitation on number of unrelated occupants in single-family districts.
(a)
It shall be unlawful and a violation of this Code for any occupants residing in or for the owner of any single-family dwelling or unit located in the R-1, R-2, or R-2A zoning districts to have more than 3 unrelated individuals residing therein. Furthermore, no family as defined in this Code shall have, in addition to the members of their family, more than two unrelated individuals residing with such family. For purposes of this section, one unrelated individual residing with a family shall include the minor child or children of such unrelated individual residing with him or her.
(b)
Any person or persons found guilty of violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-13 of this Code.
(c)
Prima facie proof of occupancy of a dwelling unit by more than three unrelated persons shall be established in any prosecution for violation of this section if it is shown that the same four or more vehicles registered to persons having different surnames and addresses were parked overnight at the dwelling a majority of nights in any 21-day period. The establishment of a prima facie level of proof in this subsection does not preclude a showing of an unauthorized occupancy of a dwelling unit by a person in any other manner.
(d)
The property owner and any agent of the property owner shall be legally responsible for directly or indirectly allowing, preventing, causing, or failing to prohibit the occupancy by more than 3 unrelated persons of a single family dwelling unit located in the R-1, R-2, and R-2A zoning districts as prohibited by this Code section.
(e)
For purposes of the prohibitions set forth in this Code section, any nonconforming use created by the definition of what "family" as provided at the time of adoption of this ordinance in 2007, and the regulations related thereto, which was a legal use at the time of such adoption shall be permitted to continue through January 1, 2008. After the date of adoption of this chapter, the use of such dwellings shall be in compliance herewith. However, any use established subsequent to the adoption of this definition of "family" and this ordinance, which use did violate and continues to violate any standards of this Code section, is illegal, not nonconforming, and shall be prosecuted as any other violation of this Code.
