ARTICLE III. - NONCONFORMING USES

Sec. 94-85. - General purpose.
Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there exists:
(1)
Lots;
(2)
Structures;
(3)
Uses of land and structures; and
(4)
Characteristics of use.
which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on; provided that the building shall be completed within one year from the date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and is not the subject of a proper enacted moratorium. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-86. - Classification changes.
(a)
When a district shall be changed, any then existing nonconforming use in the changed district may be continued or changed to a use of similar or higher classification, provided all other regulations governing the new use are complied with.
(b)
Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued or changed to a higher classification or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use or a lower classification.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-87. - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only).
Where at the time of passage of this chapter lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
(a)
No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
(b)
No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter;
(c)
If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located; and,
(d)
No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-88. - Nonconforming structures or structures and premises in combination.
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more or of structure and premises in combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(a)
No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
(b)
Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
(c)
If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises may as a special exception be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the commission, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter;
(d)
Any structure or structure and land in combination on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
(e)
When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for 60 days (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and
(f)
Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. If a nonconforming building and premises in combination suffers damage which does not exceed 50 percent of its fair market value immediately preceding such damage, the building and premises may be reconstructed, restored and reused (as before) if completed within 12 months from the time such damage occurred.
(g)
Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-89. - Repairs and maintenance.
On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a district under the terms of this chapter (other than a change through commission action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-90. - Amortization and discontinuance.
There are found to be certain uses of land, buildings and structures which have an adverse effect on the carrying out of the comprehensive plan and which can reasonably be discontinued after a reasonable time irrespective of aforementioned rules as to nonconforming uses. The following uses shall be removed or made conforming within the specified amortization period. Said amortization period shall commence upon the effective date of this chapter.
(a)
Fences, walls and foliage which constitute a hazard by virtue of impairing sight distances at a curve or intersection shall be made conforming within one calendar year.
(b)
Outdoor advertising signs and billboards deemed a nuisance or hazard shall conform within five years.
(c)
All provisions in business or industrial districts of this chapter setting forth specifications for the operation of a business or industry requiring fencing or opaque shielding shall be complied with within one calendar year. This shall include buffer zones.
(d)
Nonconforming open storage operations, such as truck parking, automobile wrecking or salvage, salvage material storage and similar uses shall be made conforming within two calendar years.
