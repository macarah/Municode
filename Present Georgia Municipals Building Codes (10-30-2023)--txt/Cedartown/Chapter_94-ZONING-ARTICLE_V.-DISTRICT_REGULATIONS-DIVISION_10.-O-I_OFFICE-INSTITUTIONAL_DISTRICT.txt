DIVISION 10. - O-I OFFICE-INSTITUTIONAL DISTRICT

Sec. 94-305. - Intent.
The O-I office-institutional districts are intended to promote and preserve districts with lower density office activities, institutional, clinical, and professional types uses. This district also allows for a mix of certain compatible residential activities. The O-I district in many cases is a practical tool for providing transition from residential uses where it is elected not to use a buffer. The O-I development standards require adequate yard space and off-street parking and service facilities. Permitted uses are restricted to protect the character of the city and from encroachment of uses capable of adversely affecting the limited character of the district.
(Ord. No. 20-2008, 12-8-08)
Sec. 94-306. - Required conditions.
Specialized retail sales, displays of merchandise, and storage must be within a completely enclosed building. Certain residential uses will be allowed in the O-I district as conditional uses; particular commercial uses will be permitted as conditional uses after review by the planning commission and city commission. This mixed-use environment will help preserve the historic character and allow for a greater degree of flexibility in the use of transitional zones with other existing properties.
