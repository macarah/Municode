Whenever a change to an approved and addressed road name is requested by a property owner or developer with access to the subject road, the following procedures shall apply.
(1)
A complete application shall be made with the Jackson County Department of Public Development which shall be accompanied by a petition signed by 66 percent (two-thirds) or more of the property owners adjoining the said road in agreement. (An affected property owner is one who owns an interest in property contiguous to the street.) A nonrefundable application fee of $250.00 must be submitted to the Jackson County Public Development Department prior to processing; provided, however, applications initiated by city or county staff will have no fees associated with them.
(2)
Within 30 days of submittal the department will determine the percentage of the affected property owners that has signed the petition. If less than 66 percent of the affected property owners have signed the petition, it will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant. If 66 percent or more have signed, the department will review the proposed road name for compliance with the requirements of this article.
(3)
If the proposed road name meets all criteria provided in the GISOP, the proposed road name will be placed on a "reserve list" in the road book. A letter will then be sent by the Jackson County GIS department to affected county departments for review and comments. If the requested name change receives any unfavorable comments, the Jackson County GIS Department will schedule a meeting with affected departments and agencies to develop recommendations as to the beginning and ending points of said change (if necessary), or name change, or any road number changes that may be applicable.
(4)
After review and acceptance by the county departments of the request, and if 66 percent or more of the affected property owners have signed a petition, then the proposal will be placed on the agenda of the Arcade City Council. If all of the affected property owners do not agree to the requested road name change, or if less than 100 percent have signed the petition, then an advertised public hearing before the Arcade City Council will be scheduled and held. Note, however, that at least 66 percent of the affected property owners must sign the petition for it to be accepted for processing.
(5)
A notice advertising the name change shall be required to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and county at least 15 days, but not more than 45 days, before the public hearing.
(6)
If, after public hearing, the name change is approved by the Arcade City Council, then the county departments will make changes as necessary and again notify affected property owners and public agencies in writing at least ten days before the change becomes effective.
(7)
The applicant for road name change that has been approved shall be responsible for revising any final plats and paying any associated fees. The applicant shall also be responsible for the cost of new road name signs that will replace existing road name signs.

Owners of adjoining properties shall be notified in writing that the change is taking place and provided a list of proposed road names from which input shall be considered. A selection will be chosen after receiving input and be presented to the Arcade City Council for approval. For any case in which a continuous road has multiple names, the Jackson County GIS Department will determine the correct name and notify owners along such road of the name change. In the event of a conflict in either road naming or addressing, the Jackson County GIS Department will use its best judgment to resolve the conflict and have the responsibility of notifying the owner, E 9-1-1, USPS, and other agencies.
