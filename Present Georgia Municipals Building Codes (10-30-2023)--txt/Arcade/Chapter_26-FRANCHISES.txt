Sec. 26-1. - Private utility providers.
No person, business entity or other organization shall engage in the business of providing telephone, cable television, electricity, natural gas, or waste disposal/trash services within the city limits without having first applied for and receiving a franchise under this chapter and a business license to engage in such business.
Sec. 26-2. - Application; authorization; private contractors.
(a)
Upon application being filed on forms prepared and approved by the city council and execution of a franchise agreement with the city, firms may be franchised for operation within the city. Such franchised firm shall be approved and authorized by the city council to provide such services as provided for in the franchise agreement. Franchises shall be granted for a period of one year. The city may award a new franchise to any applicant at any time; however, any new franchise must not have an effective date before the expiration of an existing franchise covering that territory unless the new franchise is a renewal or unless the existing franchise is terminated as provided in this section. Franchises shall be granted or disapproved after investigation into the financial status of applicants; the ability of the applicant to serve the franchised area; the needs of the area; and the ability of the applicant to provide a service as would be in the best interests and serve the general welfare of the citizens of the area.
(b)
No franchise hereunder may be delegated, assigned or otherwise transferred to any person or entity by the existing franchise without the express written permission and approval from the city council.
(c)
In the event a franchise is granted to any private contractor, the individual subscribing to the private contractor shall still be required to pay any fees and assessment provided by this chapter.
