(22)
Any waters or wastes which, by interaction with other waters or wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form solids which interfere with the collection system or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
(f)
Permit for exceeding concentration limits. The city may issue permits specifying limits greater than the limits in this chapter based on special agreements with the city, provided that all applicable state and/or federal categorical pretreatment requirements are met and provided that local treatment plant mass loadings are not violated. The permission to exceed concentration limits will be revoked if POTW mass loadings are exceeded. Additional testing requirements will be necessary for an industry which seeks permission to exceed concentration limits and may include testing of the waste treatment plant influent and effluent as well as the user's own effluent. The costs associated with such testing will be paid by the user for the parameter the user seeks permission to exceed.
(g)
Modification of limits. The city reserves the right to modify the industrial discharge limits and conditions at the time of the permit renewal. Industrial users requesting permit variances must do so at least 60 days prior to the expiration of their discharge permits.

Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations and limits set by the city as stated in their permit. Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. The city in no way shall be responsible for the design operation of the plant; the review is intended only to ensure compatibility of the pretreatment system with the wastewater system.
(i)
Publication of list of users in significant noncompliance. The city may annually publish in the local newspaper a list of the users which are in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the same 12 months.
(j)
Report of discharges; sampling; recordkeeping.
(1)
Reporting requirements. The user will be required to submit to the city engineer reports indicating the nature and concentration of effluents on a periodic basis. Specific reporting requirements will be indicated in the user's permit.
(2)
Analytical techniques. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and procedures approved by the EPA.
(3)
Sample collection.
a.
The user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city engineer may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
b.
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(4)
Timing of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(5)
Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city.
(k)
Compliance with federal pretreatment limits. No industry will exceed the pretreatment limits as established by the EPA in accordance with section 307(b) and (c) of the Act (33 USC 1347) which apply to a specific category of industrial users.
(l)
Dilution of discharge. No user shall increase the use of water or in any way dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(m)
Reports of changed conditions.
(1)
Each user must notify the city engineer of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater, at least 90 days before the change.
(2)
The city engineer may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application.
(3)
The city engineer may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(4)
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(n)
Confidentiality of information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections, shall be available without restriction unless the user contends such information and data constitute a trade secret, in which case the information may be withheld from the general public. The effluent data will never be considered as confidential information. Information accepted by the city as confidential, and portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes, shall be transmitted to a government agency when required to document compliance with the pretreatment program. In matters of judicial review or enforcement proceedings against an industrial user, the city shall provide all available information pertaining to that industry to the government agency.
(o)
Monitoring facilities. The city shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of all building sewers before they leave the property. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
(p)
Effect of new federal categorical pretreatment standards; modification of federal pretreatment standards.
(1)
Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter.
(2)
Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the state for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. For purposes of this subsection, the term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system and 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) or 40 CFR 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
(q)
Compliance with federal categorical pretreatment standards.
(1)
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated.
(2)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the city engineer may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(3)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city engineer shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(4)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(5)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(r)
Baseline monitoring reports.
(1)
Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the city engineer a report which contains the information listed in subsection (r)(2) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the city engineer a report which contains the information listed in subsection (r)(2) of this section. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
(2)
Users described in subsection (r)(1) of this section shall submit the following information:
a.
The name and address of the facility, including the name of the operator and owner.
b.
A list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility.
c.
A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operations carried out by such user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of water use and discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.
d.
Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily water use and wastewater discharges, in gallons per day, to the POTW from all process streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
e.
Measurement of pollutants. The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.
