(Code 1987, § 12-6)
Sec. 74-7. - EPA sewer user charge system.
(a)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Act means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as PL 92-500, as amended.
BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of oxygen utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedures in five days at 20 degrees Celsius expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/l).
Domestic strength wastes means any wastes which have an average daily concentration not exceeding 350 mg/l BOD or 250 mg/l of SS.
EPA user charge means that portion of the total sewer bill which is attributable to the implementation of the EPA user charge system. Such rates include collection of operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses.
Operation, maintenance, and replacement costs means the treatment works in good repair and at design specifications. This includes labor, supplies, utilities, chemicals, billing, administration, and general expenses including installation and/or repair of equipment, accessories, or appurtenances necessary during the service life of the treatment works.
Over-strength wastes means any wastewater discharged into the treatment works which exceeds a BOD of 350 mg/l or a SS of 250 mg/l.
SS (suspended solids) means solids that either float on the surface of or are in suspension in water, sewage, or other liquids and which are removable by laboratory filtering.
Toxic pollutant means any discharge into the treatment works which interferes with the normal biological process of the treatment works or in some way reduces the efficiency of the treatment works or causes special procedures to be necessary to properly dispose of either effluent or sludge produced by the treatment works so that the cost of such disposal is increased.
User means any person who discharges wastes into the treatment works whether continuously or occasionally. A wastewater customer is a user, but a user does not necessarily have to be a wastewater customer.
Wastewater customer means any residence, business, industry, school, or other building tied into and receiving services from the treatment works and receiving periodic billings thereof.
(b)
Calculation. The EPA user charge system shall result in the calculation of three unit charges:
(1)
An administrative charge to be calculated based on the administration costs and the number of wastewater customers to be assessed on a per meter basis;
(2)
An operation, maintenance, and replacement fee calculated based on the volume of water used by wastewater customers and the total operation, maintenance, and replacement costs incurred by the city to be assessed on a per 1,000 gallons of water used basis; and,
(3)
A surcharge rate to be applied to all overstrength wastes to be based on the strength and volume of such wastes and the cost of treatment.
The calculation procedures for these charges are more particularly described in "Guidance For Developing EPA User Charge Systems For Small Municipalities" prepared by the Georgia Institute of Technology Engineering Experiment Station, dated May 1980.
(c)
Toxic pollutants. Any user discharging any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the aforementioned treatment works shall be required to pay for such increased cost.
(d)
Biennial review. The city shall review not less often than every two years the wastewater contribution of users, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the treatment works, and the approved user charge system. The city shall revise the charges for users to accomplish the following:
(1)
Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs among users;
(2)
Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and maintenance costs necessary to proper operation and maintenance (including minor replacement) of the treatment works; and
(3)
Apply excess revenues collected to adjust future rates accordingly.
(e)
Notification. The city will notify each user at least annually in conjunction with a regular bill or other mailing, of the rate attributable to the user charge.
(f)
Effect on agreements. The user charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts between the city and users which are inconsistent with the requirements of section 204(b)(1)(A) of the Act and 40 CFR 35, dated September 27, 1978.
(g)
EPA user charge unit rates. The EPA user charge, which includes charges for operations, maintenance, and replacement expenses, will be assessed for all contributors to the treatment works and shall be as set forth in the schedule of rates and charges.

Nonpayment by the tenth of month following month of reading will be subject to a penalty of 25 percent of the delinquent account.
(2)
Nonpayment by the 16th day of the month will result in the water being shut off from the water user's property.
(3)
Nonpayment for 60 days after original date will allow the city, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to terminate the agreement, and in such event, the water user shall not be entitled to receive, nor the city obligated to supply, any water under this agreement.
(b)
Water and sewer service shall not be reconnected until customer's delinquent bill, including penalty and disconnection charges, have been paid in full. Should such customer thereafter desire to be reconnected to the water and sewer system, a reconnection charge as set forth in the schedule of rates and charges shall be collected. Bills shall be paid at the city hall and a failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from becoming delinquent, nor relieve the consumer from payment of same.
