Sec. 5-5-1. - Purpose.
Athens-Clarke County is authorized by the State constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof and state law, to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout Athens-Clarke County, which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of Athens-Clarke County. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The Athens-Clarke County Commission has determined that development in Athens-Clarke County to date, and the outlook for continued development at an increasing rate in the future, has created and will continue to create additional needs for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within Athens-Clarke County. Athens-Clarke County has engaged a consultant to perform Professional Engineering and Financial Analyses of Athens-Clarke County's stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to Athens-Clarke County for dealing with stormwater management, and has received, reviewed and considered the results of the consultant's analyses which identify stormwater management needs, propose strategic program goals and priorities, estimate the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, examine reasonable charges by Athens-Clarke County for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within Athens-Clarke County to support such costs. The Athens-Clarke County Commission finds and concludes from the Professional Engineering and Financial Analyses that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services, systems and facilities within Athens-Clarke County. Athens-Clarke County Commission finds and concludes from the Professional Engineering and Financial Analyses that a fair and equitable rate structure for those owners of developed property in Athens-Clarke County receiving the benefits of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the proceeds of which will be dedicated to Athens-Clarke County stormwater utility for carrying out its purposes, will be essential if Athens-Clarke County is to provide the level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of Athens-Clarke County.
(Ord. of 12-7-2004, § 1)
Sec. 5-5-2. - Findings.
The Athens-Clarke County Commission makes the following findings of fact:
(a)
Athens-Clarke County is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout Athens-Clarke County.
(b)
The management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond Athens-Clarke County is a matter that affects the health, safety and welfare of all residents and businesses in Athens-Clarke County.
(c)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may create environmental damage to the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to Athens-Clarke County.
(d)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within Athens-Clarke County and surrounding areas.
(e)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the operations of sanitary sewer operated by Athens-Clarke County by, among other things, increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(f)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on Athens-Clarke County's wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies.
(g)
The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.) (the "Act"), and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act imposed by regulatory obligations of its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit require Athens-Clarke County to reduce pollution in its stormwater discharge and increase water quality to the maximum extent practicable.
(h)
Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing and future development in Athens-Clarke County. Athens-Clarke County has several rivers and streams listed on the list of impaired waters produced by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, or other appropriate authorities pursuant to Section 303(d) of the Act.
(i)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES permit will substantially increase the cost of stormwater management above that which is currently spent for drainage and flood control.
(j)
The cost of operating and maintaining the Athens-Clarke County stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(k)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the unified government of Athens-Clarke County hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(l)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Athens-Clarke County is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Charter of Athens-Clarke County to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ III(a)(6).
(m)
The unified government of Athens-Clarke County fully incorporates by reference into these findings the Stormwater Utility Development and Implementation Plan dated May 2004, the Funding Action Strategy dated September 2003, the Stormwater Areawide Master Plan dated March 2001 (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Professional Engineering and Financial Analyses"), said documents on file in the office of the transportation and public works department.
(n)
The Professional Engineering and Financial Analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to Athens-Clarke County assess and define the stormwater management issues, needs, goals, program priorities and operational opportunities of Athens-Clarke County.
(o)
Given the issues, needs, goals, priorities and operational opportunities identified in the Professional Engineering and Financial Analyses submitted to Athens-Clarke County, Athens-Clarke County determines to establish a stormwater utility within Athens-Clarke County that is dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in Athens-Clarke County in concert with other water resource management programs.
(p)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout Athens-Clarke County. Development in Athens-Clarke County has altered the natural hydrology with some natural elements having been replaced or augmented by man-made facilities. Even areas of Athens-Clarke County that remain less densely developed and rural in character with natural stormwater drainage predominating demand services along roads where ditches and culverts have been installed. As a result, stormwater management services systems and facilities needs apply to all areas of Athens-Clarke County.
(q)
The stormwater needs in Athens-Clarke County include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities and regulation of the use therefore renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of Athens-Clarke County, and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of Athens-Clarke County concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the Professional Engineering and Financial Analyses.
(r)
The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the long-term demands the properties owned impose on Athens-Clarke County's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(s)
Athens-Clarke County presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by Athens-Clarke County, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of Athens-Clarke County to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in Athens-Clarke County in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources in Athens-Clarke County. In order to do so, Athens-Clarke County must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems and facilities.
(t)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout Athens-Clarke County, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in Athens-Clarke County through stormwater service charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described more fully herein.
(u)
A schedule of stormwater utility service charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout Athens-Clarke County. Such service charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by Athens-Clarke County Commissioners.
(v)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which significantly reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on Athens-Clarke County's stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by Athens-Clarke County and as set forth herein.
(w)
The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by Athens-Clarke County or to be provided by Athens-Clarke County in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge.
(x)
In addition to impervious area, the amount and types of pollutants that are carried by stormwater runoff is closely tied to the use of the property. Sampling of stormwater runoff from across the United States has demonstrated that the runoff from the more heavily used property, such as commercial and industrial developments, contain greater quantities of pollutants than less intensely developed residential properties. The water quality component of Athens-Clarke County's stormwater program will concentrate more heavily in those areas where the land use of the properties generates the greatest quantity of pollutants and will be reflected in the stormwater quality charge of those properties.
(y)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and the commission directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the Athens-Clarke County stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be disbursed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

(b)
Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities which are located on private or public property not owned by Athens-Clarke County, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to Athens-Clarke County for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management and systems and facilities, shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the laws of the state and the United States.
(c)
It is the express intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of Athens-Clarke County. Athens-Clarke County expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon Athens-Clarke County, its commissioners, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship.
(Ord. of 12-7-2004, § 1)
Sec. 5-5-7. - Service charges, user fees, etc.
(a)
It shall be the policy of Athens-Clarke County that service charges and user fees for the stormwater management services, systems and facilities to be provided by the stormwater utility in the service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services, systems and facilities by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities. Stormwater service charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant service charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rates, charges or fees. Service charge rates shall be coordinated with the use of other rates, charges or fees employed for stormwater management within Athens-Clarke County, whether within or outside the defined service areas, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements and special assessments. In setting the rentals, rates, charges, fees or licenses for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, Athens-Clarke County Commission shall also take into consideration the impact such will have in regulating the use of such services, systems and facilities.
(b)
The cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may include operating expenses, capital investments and reserve accounts.
(c)
Service areas shall be established to reflect significant variations in services provided to stormwater utility customers. The boundaries of the service areas are described herein and depicted generally and for informational purposes only on the official map of Athens-Clarke County stormwater utility service areas prepared and maintained by the director, and amended from time to time, referred to in this section as the "map."
(d)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to Athens-Clarke County's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(Ord. of 12-7-2004, § 1)
Sec. 5-5-8. - Service charge rates.
(a)
Stormwater service charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the Athens-Clarke County Commission. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the Athens-Clarke County Commission to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, reflect the value of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities to those property owners who benefit therefrom, and which, together with other sources of support available to Athens-Clarke County stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, nonoperating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the Athens-Clarke County Commission.
(b)
The basis for computation of the charge for stormwater services to all developed property within Athens-Clarke County is established under this section. The amount of charge to be imposed, the establishment of formulas for the calculation of charges, the creation of customer classifications for the imposition of charges, and changes in such charges, formulas and customer classifications may be made by further resolution of the Athens-Clarke County Commission. All charges established pursuant to this section shall be fair and reasonable.
(c)
The director shall assign a customer classification to all developed property within Athens-Clarke County. The director shall be responsible for determining the impervious area, land area, land use or other factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the stormwater fee based on the best available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the county board of assessors, aerial photography, the property owner, tenant or developer. The director may require additional information as necessary to make the determination. The billing amount shall be updated by the director based on any additions to the impervious area as approved through the building permit process.
(d)
Charges shall be imposed to recover all or a portion of the costs of the stormwater utility. Such charges, established herein, may include the following components:
(1)
Base charge. A base charge may be imposed on all developed property in Athens-Clarke County. The base charge is established in recognition of the fact that all properties in Athens-Clarke County receive services from the stormwater management activities provided by Athens-Clarke County and that all developed property contributes to the stormwater discharge that Athens-Clarke County must manage. The base charge shall be charged to collect the administrative costs of the stormwater utility and may include capital, operating and maintenance costs of the stormwater utility which are not recovered by other means. The base charge is based on the ERU and is calculated using the formula identified below.
(2)
Quantity charge. A quantity charge may be imposed on all developed property in Athens-Clarke County. The quantity charge shall be charged based upon the impervious area and/or other factors affecting the volume and rate of stormwater runoff as reasonably determined by the Athens-Clarke County. The quantity charge is based on ERU and is calculated using the formula identified below.
(3)
Quality charge. A quality charge may be charged to all developed property in Athens-Clarke County. The quality charge reflects the services provided to treat stormwater or compensate for the difference in pollutants from properties of different land use. The quality charge is determined by multiplying the base charges by a water quality factor as described below.
(e)
Calculation of charges. The monthly stormwater utility charges imposed to recover the cost of the stormwater utility program are as follows:
EXPAND
Base Charge ..... $ 2.07 × ERU
Quantity Charge ..... $ 0.86 × ERU
Quality Charge ..... $ 0.57 × ERU ×

The director shall be responsible for determining the impervious area and other required information for each developed property in Athens-Clarke County based on the best available information, including, but not limited to, data supplied by the county board of assessors, aerial photography, the property owner, developer or other method as may be required. The number of ERUs that will form the basis of the base charge and quantity charge shall be established in the following manner:
1.
Small single-family—The charges shall be equal to 0.6 ERUs.
2.
Medium single-family—The charges shall be equal to 1.0 ERU.
3.
Large single-family—The charges shall be equal to 1.8 ERUs.
