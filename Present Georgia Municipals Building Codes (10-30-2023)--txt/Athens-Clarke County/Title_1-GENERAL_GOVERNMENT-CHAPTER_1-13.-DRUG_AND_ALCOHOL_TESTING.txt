Athens-Clarke County employees are a most valuable resource, and it is Athens-Clarke County's goal to provide a healthy, satisfying work environment which promotes personal opportunities for growth. Athens-Clarke County's policy is to: (1) assure that employees are not impaired in their ability to perform assigned duties in a safe, productive, and healthy manner; (2) create a workplace environment free from the adverse effects of drug abuse and alcohol misuse; (3) prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of controlled substances; and (4) encourage employees to seek professional assistance any time personal problems, including alcohol or drug dependency, adversely affect their ability to perform their assigned duties.
Drug and alcohol use by Athens-Clarke County employees during assigned working hours, in government buildings or on government grounds, or otherwise while on government business, is prohibited. This shall include the use of illegal substances, the abuse of prescription medications and the use of alcohol.
( Ord. of 4-5-2016 , § 1)

Sec. 1-13-3. - Pre-employment drug and alcohol testing.
A.
All job applicants being considered for employment in Category I and Category III positions shall be required to pass a drug and alcohol screening test as the final step prior to being hired. All job applicants shall be informed in advance that said testing shall be required.
B.
For purposes of administering drug and alcohol testing for Category I and Category III positions, pre-employment testing may be required not only for new hires but also for the employment actions of promotion, demotion, and re-employment to a safety sensitive position, unless the requirement is waived by the Human Resources Director because the employee has passed a drug and alcohol test within the last 30 days.
( Ord. of 4-5-2016 , § 1)
Sec. 1-13-4. - Employees subject to random drug and alcohol testing.
A.
Only those employees set forth in section 1-13-2, Category I and Category III, shall be subject to random testing for drugs and alcohol. A statistically valid computer-based random selection method will be used to select employees for random drug and alcohol testing, thus allowing each employee in a Category I and Category III position to have an equal chance of being tested.
B.
Random testing shall be done just before, during, or just after scheduled duty hours. The testing dates and times shall be with unpredictable frequency throughout the year. Category I and Category III employees hired during the year shall be added to the selection pool during the month following their hire. Some Category I and Category III employees may be tested more than once a year; some may not be tested at all depending upon the random selection. All Category I and Category III employees remain in the random selection pool at all times, regardless of whether they have been previously selected randomly for testing. Employees are to receive no prior notification of the random testing. Employees shall report to the designated testing facility for testing within two hours of receipt of the notification form from their supervisor.
( Ord. of 4-5-2016 , § 1)
Sec. 1-13-5. - Drug and/or alcohol screening test based on reasonable suspicion.

Situations that may give rise to a conclusion that an employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol include, but are not limited to, the following:

If testing cannot be done within a two-hour window, the supervisor must document the reason.
C.
Supervisors who suspect that an employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol shall immediately report the incident to their division manager and department director.

E.
Following the determination that reasonable suspicion exists, the employee shall immediately be transported to and from the testing site by the employee's supervisor or a designee. If an employee is found to be in violation of these regulations, then following the testing procedure, the person transporting the employee shall make appropriate arrangements to transport the employee home.
F.
Supervisors shall be required to document in writing, within the next 24 hours, the specific facts, symptoms or observations that formed the basis for their determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing of an employee.

These procedures and guidelines shall be available for inspection by contacting the Athens-Clarke County Safety and Risk Manager.
B.
In accordance with HHS and SAMHSA guidelines, all urine drug testing specimens must be collected as "split" specimens. The term "split" specimen means that one urine specimen will be divided into two separately sealed specimen bottles for submission to the laboratory—one bottle (primary to be split with one half used for initial screening and the other half for the confirmation screening) and a secondary bottle for split sample testing if it is requested.
C.
Whenever an initial test is found to be positive, an automatic confirmation test will be performed. If result is positive, then that employee has 72 hours from the time of the initial notice to request from the medical review officer that the secondary bottle for split sample testing be sent to a second lab.
D.
If the employee does not contest the results, or if the secondary bottle of the split sample also tests positive, then the employer shall, within five working days after receipt of a positive confirmed test result from the laboratory, notify the employee in writing of the positive results. Such notification shall include the results, the option to contest the results within five working days of such notice, and the consequences of such results being suspension for three days with pay pending termination. If the secondary bottle produces a negative result, or for any reason the secondary bottle is not available, then the test shall be considered negative, and no sanctions shall be imposed on the employee.
E.
Breath Alcohol Test (BAT). If results of BAT are positive, then a confirmation test must be conducted at least 15 minutes, but not more than 20 minutes, after the completion of the initial test.
