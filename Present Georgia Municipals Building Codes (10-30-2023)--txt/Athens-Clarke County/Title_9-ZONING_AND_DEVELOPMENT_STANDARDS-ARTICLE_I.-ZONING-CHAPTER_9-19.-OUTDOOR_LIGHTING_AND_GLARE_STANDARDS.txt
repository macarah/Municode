Sec. 9-19-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to promote public safety, nighttime vision, natural-resource conservation, community values and aesthetics by establishing standards for the design and application of outdoor-lighting sources and fixtures for nighttime use.
Accordingly, the specific regulatory objectives of this Chapter are as follows.
A.
Promote nighttime visibility by directing appropriate levels of illumination upon intended targets.
B.
Redress the disabling visual effects of glare and excessive illumination, and the extreme contrasts between brightly lighted areas and the lower ambient levels of adjacent areas.
C.
Limit light trespass across property lines, and its intrusive and devaluing effects upon nearby private and public property.
D.
Protect air and water quality, and conserve natural resources.
E.
Limit light pollution for the following purposes:
1.
Restore natural cycles of light and dark to the indigenous natural environment, thereby redressing a cause of impaired vegetative growth and wildlife habitat; and
2.
Darken the night sky by reducing the unnecessary transmission of upward light—both directly from an unshielded light source and indirectly from ground-level reflections of excessive downward light.

Sec. 9-19-2. - Definitions.
Direct burial ground fixture: Upward directed lighting assembly that is installed such that the lens or outermost portion of the fixture is flush with the grade of the ground or surrounding surface in which it is installed.
Direct light: Light or illumination emitted directly from a fixture's light source, including the lens and globes associated with the fixture
Fixture: Complete lighting assembly consisting of a lamp or lamps, together with the parts designed to power, position, house, and protect the lamp; and other parts (such as a lens, reflector, or globe) which function together with the lamp as a light source to emit, control, direct, and disperse light. Not included is the support assembly (pole, arm, or mounting bracket) to which the lighting unit is attached. If multiple lighting units are attached to a common support assembly, each unit shall be considered to be an individual lighting fixture. A fixture with multiple lamps comprises only a single fixture.
Floodlights: Fixtures that project light in a broad, directed beam, typically of two lamp types: simple lamps whose supporting optic elements are part of the fixture casement, having wide beam angles up to 110 degrees; or sealed-beam lamps with internal parabolic reflectors, having narrower beam-spread angles of 25 to 55 degrees.
Fluorescent Lighting: A lamp that produces visible light by fluorescence, especially a glass tube whose inner wall is coated with a material that fluoresces when an electrical current causes a vapor within the tube to discharge electrons.
Full-cutoff fixture: Class of lighting fixture defined by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) according to technical photometric criteria. Included among those design criteria is a pattern of light distribution which does not permit any light to project at or above the horizontal plane from the lowest light emitting point of the lighting fixture—either dispersed directly from the lamp source or an integrated diffusing element, or indirectly from an integrated reflector surface, refractive lens, or refractive globe. These fixtures are also often referred to as "horizontally cutoff fixtures."
Footcandle: Measure of illumination equivalent to one lumen produced uniformly on a surface of one square foot, as measured by a light meter.
Fully shielded fixture: Lighting application that is designed, constructed, and installed to meet all glare and light-trespass standards of this Chapter. In most instances, a fully shielded lighting application will include a horizontally cutoff fixture, but in all instances must be shielded so as to meet all light-containment provisions of this Chapter with respect to glare and light trespass. Any part providing this shielding shall be permanently attached to the lighting fixture.
Glare: Effect caused by light sufficiently greater than that to which the eye is readily adapted, such that annoyance, physical discomfort, or visual impairment is experienced by an observer.
IESNA: Abbreviation for Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, a professional society of individuals, academics, and businesses engaged in the lighting industry.
Lamp: Component, tube, or bulb of a lighting fixture that produces the light. Multiple lamps within a single fixture are lumen-rated cumulatively as if a single lamp.
Light pollution is a general expression for any and all uncontained light, both directed and reflected, that increases ambient light.
Light source: the point of origin from which illumination emanates; usually a lamp.
Light trespass: Intrusion of direct light projected from one property or roadway onto another property or roadway.
Lumen: Unit of illumination measuring the rate at which a lamp emits light where one lumen per square foot is one footcandle.
Non-constant lighting: Light fixtures meant not to operate continuously, and operated only briefly, irregularly, intermittently, or occasionally by a switching device. Fixture activation by a motion sensor may provide non-constant lighting.
Outdoor lighting: Illumination of an exterior area. Included are open air spaces which are under a roof or other cover and not fully enclosed, such as a canopy, pavilion, drive-through bay, or parking deck.
Roadway: Street, including the right-of-way, as defined elsewhere in Chapter 9-2, whether for public or private use.
Spotlights: Fixtures that project light in a narrow beam, contained and centered on a directional axis. Related lamps typically are sealed-beam with internal parabolic reflectors and beam-spread angles of 9 to 15 degrees.
Top-shielded fixture: A lighting fixture that, either by its top-most shielding or by its sheltered placement under a soffit, cornice, roof, canopy, or other structural element, limits light at or above the horizontal plane.
Tube lighting: Gas-filled glass tube that becomes luminescent in a color characteristic of the particular gas used, such as neon, argon, krypton, etc. Excluded from this lighting class are common fluorescent tubes.
