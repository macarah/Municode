(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 7-7-2009, § 1)
Sec. 9-15-3. - Buffer requirements.
A.
Side and rear yard buffers. Whenever any nonresidential use, other than agricultural, abuts a residential zoning district other than "AR" or when multifamily residences are adjacent to single-family residences or districts, or a manufactured home park or subdivision, one of the following buffers shall be installed on the lot with the more intensive or nonresidential use along the common lot lines:
1.
Natural buffer strip: A strip at least 50 feet wide, having an existing natural growth equivalent to a densely planted evergreen screen. The planning staff may require additional planting to acquire a uniform buffer strip.
2.
Landscape buffer strip: A strip at least 20 feet wide, densely planted with an appropriate mix of trees and shrubs at least three feet high at the time of planting, of a type that will possess growth characteristics of such a nature as to produce a dense, compact evergreen planting screen capable of growing to a height of at least six feet within three years. A landscape plan identifying all plants to be incorporated in the buffer strips must be approved by planning staff prior to any site construction. Planning staff may require additional planting to acquire a uniform buffer strip.
3.
Landscape buffer wall: A buffer strip at least ten feet wide, containing an opaque wall or barrier or uniformly painted fence at least six feet in height. Buffer strips shall have five feet of landscape plantings on the exterior side of the wall and shall be planted with appropriate trees, shrubs, and ground cover as to provide a transition from the wall to both edges of the buffer strip. A landscape plan identifying the location and construction of the wall or barrier and all plants to be incorporated in the buffer strip must be approved by planning staff prior to any site construction. Planning staff may require additional planting to acquire a uniform buffer strip. This title will allow any of these three buffers or a combination thereof to provide flexibility in design.
B.
Street frontage buffers. Except in the C-D zone, all nonresidential and multifamily uses must abide by the following street frontage buffer requirements for those portions of the property directly across a local street from a single-family district:
1.
A 15-foot minimum landscaped street frontage buffer containing trees, shrubs, and ground cover must be placed between the right-of-way line and any structure or parking lot, planted in a uniformly distributed manner. Selection of shrubs and ground cover should be such that no shrub or ground cover should grow higher than four feet.
2.
All street frontage buffers shall follow the sight distance triangle requirements as stated in Section 9-15-2, Section 7-2-7, and the Transportation and Public Works Department Technical Standards.
3.
Property or business identification signs may be incorporated into the street frontage buffers.
C.
Exceptions to buffering requirements. The landscaping and buffering requirements set forth herein shall be subject to the following exceptions:
1.
Prescribed fences or walls may be waived if a building, fence, or wall of at least equivalent height, opacity, and maintenance exists immediately abutting and on the opposite side of such lot line.
2.
An earthen berm not exceeding two feet in height may count towards the prescribed height of any fence, wall, or dense landscaping.
3.
At no time should the buffering of a side or rear lot line come closer than 20 feet to any street line.
D.
Maintenance of buffers. All required plantings shall be permanently maintained in good growing condition and, whenever necessary, replaced with new plant materials to ensure continued compliance with applicable landscaping requirements. All required fences and walls shall be permanently maintained in good condition and whenever necessary repaired or replaced.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 6-5-2007, § 6; Ord. of 7-7-2009, § 2; Ord. of 5-1-2012, § 4)
Sec. 9-15-4. - Yard measurements.
All yard measurements to and between buildings or structures or for the purpose of computing coverage or similar requirements shall be made to the building and shall be unobstructed from the ground upward, except for those projections allowed in Section 9-15-9.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 4-7-2009, § 1)
Sec. 9-15-5. - Screening of junk yards.
A.
Certain uses such as junk yard or salvage yard operations and other commercial and industrial operations requiring the storage of inoperative equipment or vehicles for prolonged periods of time could present unsightly views or health hazards. To preclude this from occurring, owners of such properties shall completely enclose such operations by a fence which completely obscures views of the property from adjacent sidewalks and streets, built to a height greater than that of the height of the highest piece of equipment or vehicle stored on the property, provided that no fence shall be less than eight feet nor more than 20 feet in height when measured from the crown of the adjacent street(s). Such fences shall be constructed of solid materials. Construction of cyclone fencing which utilizes metal inserts as screening shall be prohibited. Fencing along street frontages shall be located not closer than 90 feet from the centerline of the adjacent street.
B.
Many operations which involve the stacking of inoperative or obsolete equipment or vehicles pose a direct health hazard to the public. All such operations are subject to an annual inspection by the health department. The results of any such inspections shall be delivered to planning staff for review. If a business fails to pass such inspection, it shall have 30 days to comply or it shall cease operations until such time that compliance is effected.
C.
All uses listed herein shall be operated in strict conformance with the following regulations:
1.
The minimum land area for a junk salvage yard shall be five acres; provided further that the mayor and commission of Athens-Clarke County upon recommendation of the building official may authorize a licensed automobile salvage yard to maintain less area if all other provisions of the zoning ordinance are observed and a smaller area would best serve the public interest; provided, however, that in no case will an automobile yard contain less than one acre.
2.
No automobile salvage yard or used parts dealer shall store more than 50 automobile bodies per net storage acre. For the purpose of enforcing this title, a "net storage acre" is 75 percent of an acre, provided that the formula for determining maximum storage density to individual automobile salvage yards is:
A×0.75×50 (automobile bodies)
A = Total Contiguous Acreage
3.
All junk yards, salvage yards, and related uses shall be located on well-drained areas; provided that no drainage channel or watercourse shall traverse storage and dismantling operations areas; provided further, that all drainage channels terminating in public watercourses or public lakes or reservoirs shall be constructed in accordance to the specifications provided by the public works department and chief building official and shall be approved by the Athens-Clarke County Health Department.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-15-6. - Land surveys.
Before any action is taken pursuant to this title which would cause adjustments or realignment of property lines, required yard areas, or setbacks, the exact lot lines shall be validated by location of official survey pins or by a survey performed by a licensed surveyor.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-15-7. - Single-Family Residential Standards.
New construction of single-family residential dwellings, with the exception of manufactured homes, in subdivisions platted with an overall density exceeding 2.5 dwelling units per acre or on residential lots less than 8,000 square feet shall comply with the design standards established in section 9-25-8-B.
(Ord. of 12-7-2010, § 1)
Sec. 9-15-8. - Nonconforming uses and structures.
A.
A nonconforming structure may not have the element of its nonconformity enlarged or extended unless a variance is issued in accordance with chapter 9-21. A legal, nonconforming structure shall otherwise be maintained and repaired or structurally altered, under permit, in accordance with all pertinent building codes and ordinances. Failure to maintain a non-conforming structure in minimal compliance with applicable codes and ordinances, such that the general condition of the structure constitutes dilapidation or significant disrepair, shall create a rebuttable presumption of the owner or occupier's intent to abandon the nonconforming structure. Revocation of a structure's certificate of occupancy for a period in excess of 12 months shall also evidence the owner or occupier's intent to abandon the nonconforming structure.
B.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, a legal non-conforming use, in active existence on the effective date of this title, may be continued without interference until such time as the property owner or occupier intentionally relinquishes its right to maintain such use, as evidenced by an overt act, or failure to act, sufficient to support a finding of such intent. For purposes of this section, discontinuance of the use for a period of 12 months or more shall create a rebuttable presumption of the owner or occupier's intent to abandon the non-conforming use. Discontinuance includes the absence of any or all required local permits, for example, an alcoholic beverage license or occupation tax certificate.
C.
Discontinuance of a use or structure following its destruction by fire or other natural hazard shall not evidence intent to abandon if the owner applies for a permit to rebuild the structure, or otherwise reactivate the use, within six months of the occurrence; provided, however, this period may be extended for a period not to exceed an additional six months if the owner demonstrates to the planning director that he or she has a substantial investment of time, effort and money in the property.
D.
It shall be the objective of Athens-Clarke County that whenever feasible, legal nonconforming uses be rendered conforming through the issuance of special use permits, in accordance with chapter 9-20. Conditions imposed on such permits shall strive to ameliorate the impact of such use on adjacent or nearby properties and uses permitted by the zoning classification.
E.
Manufactured homes. The following restrictions shall apply to the replacement of manufactured homes permitted prior to December 2003 and located within a zoning district that otherwise restricts or prohibits the placement of manufactured homes:
1.
A replacement permit shall be issued by the Athens-Clarke County Building Permits and Inspection Department for a Class "B" Manufactured Home if the existing dwelling has been occupied in the previous 12 months, the building setbacks of the zoning district can be met, and the manufactured home complies with building regulations specified in section 7-1-604 of the Code of Athens-Clarke County.
2.
A building permit shall be issued by the Athens-Clarke County Building Permits and Inspection Department for a Class "A" Manufactured Home when replacing a Class "A" or Class "B" Manufactured Home if the existing dwelling has been occupied in the previous 12 months, the building setbacks of the zoning district can be met, and the manufactured home complies with building regulations specified in section 7-1-604 of the Code of Athens-Clarke County.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 12-2-2003, § 4; Ord. of 8-1-2006, § 1; Ord. of 7-3-2018(3), § 4 )

A.
If there are dwellings or accessory buildings on both abutting lots (even if separated by an alley or private way) with front yards of less than the required depth for the district, and with front elevations equal to or greater than the height of the front elevation height for the proposed structure, the front yard for the lot with the proposed structure need not exceed the average front yard of the abutting structures.
B.
If there is a dwelling or accessory building on one abutting lot with a front yard of less than the required depth for the district and with a front elevation equal to or greater than the height of the front elevation height for the proposed structure, the front yard for the lot with the proposed structure need not exceed a depth one-half way between the depth of the abutting lot and the required front yard depth.
C.
Enclosed architectural projections, such as eaves, bay windows having no floor space, and chimneys, may intrude 24 inches in the yard requirement. Non-habitable unenclosed architectural projections such as porches, stairs, stoops, and awnings may extend 7.5 feet into a required front yard setback, or 24 inches into a required side or rear yard setback.
D.
Ramps, lifts and access facilities for the handicapped may project into a required setback area.
E.
Milledge Avenue front yard setbacks. The front yard setback distances for properties fronting Milledge Avenue in the area between the intersection of Milledge Avenue with Prince Avenue and the intersection of Milledge Avenue with South Lumpkin and Milledge Circle shall be determined in the following manner:
1.
The minimum front yard setback shall not be less than the existing front yard setback that is closest to the public right-of-way on an abutting property.
2.
The maximum front yard setback shall not exceed the existing front yard setback that is furthest from the public right-of-way on an abutting property.
3.
If a subject property abuts an undeveloped tract, public street, private way, or alley, the front yard setback distance of the next adjacent property that fronts Milledge Avenue shall be used to determine minimum and maximum front yard setback distances.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1; Ord. of 11-6-2001, § 1; Ord. of 4-7-2009, § 2 ; Ord. of 2-7-2017(2), § 5 )

Utility transmission and distribution lines, poles and towers may exceed the height limits otherwise provided for in this title, except in the Airport Overlay District.
(Ord. of 12-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 9-15-11. - Lot size requirements—General exception.
A.
If a lot held in single ownership and recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court at the time of passage of the ordinance codified herein, has an area or dimension which does not meet the lot size requirements of the district in which the property is located, the lot or aggregate holdings may be occupied by a use permitted outright in the district subject to all other requirements, provided it complied with all ordinances when it was recorded.
B.
The boundaries between contiguous nonconforming lots may be adjusted if the result does not enlarge or extend the element of nonconformity by creating any of the following conditions:
1.
Additional lots;
2.
Additional nonconforming lots by area or dimension; or
3.
Lot sizes less than the smallest lot size or dimensions (i.e., width, depth) less than the shortest such dimension that existed prior to recombination.

D.
Regardless of the side and rear yard requirements of the district, in a residential district a side or rear yard may be reduced to three feet for an accessory structure, including swimming pools, erected more than 50 feet from any street other than alleys, provided the structure is detached and separated from other buildings and structures by ten feet or more, and is no more than 12 feet in height.
E.
Exclusive of swimming pools, no more than three accessory structures per lot with a single-family dwelling or two-family dwelling principal use are permitted in any RS, RM or C zone. The aggregate square footage of all accessory structures on the lot may not total more than the total square footage of the principal structure on the lot or the maximum square footage denoted in the following table, whichever is less. The contiguous roofed portion of the principal structure, including covered porches, garages, and carports shall be included in this calculation. The total square footage shall be exclusive of attics, crawl spaces, and similar storage areas. No individual accessory structure shall be equal to or exceed the size of the principal structure.

Sec. 9-15-17. - Relocation of residential structures.
A.
No person shall relocate a residential structure to a site within Athens-Clarke County, whether the structure originates from another location within Athens-Clarke County or from without Athens-Clarke County, unless that person first obtains from the building official a building relocation permit.
B.
Applications for such building relocation permit shall be made on forms specified by the building official and shall include detailed plans and specifications for the completion of the structure. The building official shall examine and review the structure and the submitted plans and specifications and shall issue the building relocation permit if the structure will, when completed:
1.
Comply with the applicable zoning ordinance, building code, electrical code, plumbing code, gas code, and all other applicable ordinances; and
2.
Meet the standards and requirements set forth in any restrictive covenants of record pertaining to the proposed relocation site, whether such covenants are in effect at the time of application or have previously expired. If the structure and proposed renovation thereof do not meet the foregoing requirements, the building official shall deny the building relocation permit and such denial may be appealed to the hearings board in the same manner as other decisions of the building official. If the building relocation permit is issued, relocation of the building must be accomplished promptly, and the building shall be renovated or completed in accordance with the submitted plans and specifications no later than 90 days following the date of issuance of the building relocation permit.
C.
The application for a building relocation permit shall be accompanied by security for the renovation and completion of the structure in accordance with the plans and specifications in an amount estimated by the applicant and approved by the building official as being sufficient therefor and shall be conditioned upon satisfactory completion within 90 days of issuance of the building permit. Such security may be in the form of:

A deposit of cash or other instrument readily convertible to cash at face value either with Athens-Clarke County or in escrow with a financial institution with the use of any instrument other than cash; and in the case of an escrow account, the bank with which the funds are to be deposited, being subject to the approval of Athens-Clarke County. In the case of an escrow account, the applicant shall file with Athens-Clarke County an agreement between the financial institution and himself/herself specifying that the funds of the escrow account shall be held in trust until released by Athens-Clarke County and may not be used or pledged by him as security in any other matter during that period and that, in the case of failure to complete the building in accordance with the plans and specifications within 90 days from issuance of the permit, then the bank shall immediately make the funds available to Athens-Clarke County for use of completion of the structure.
3.
A letter of credit from a financial institution in a form approved by Athens-Clarke County providing that the financial institution does guarantee funds in an amount equal to the aforementioned cost of completion and that in the event the applicant fails to complete the structure in accordance with the plans and specifications within 90 days of issuance of the permit, the financial institution shall pay Athens-Clarke County immediately and without further action, such funds as necessary to finance the completion of the structure up to the amount specified in the letter of credit.
