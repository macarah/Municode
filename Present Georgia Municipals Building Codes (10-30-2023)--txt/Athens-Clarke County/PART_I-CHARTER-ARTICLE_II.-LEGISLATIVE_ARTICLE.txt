(b)
The commission, by majority vote, shall adopt rules of procedure governing the transaction of its business consistent with the provisions of this Charter; shall adopt by ordinance the time, date and place for regular meetings, which will be held at least once each month; and shall provide for keeping minutes of its proceedings by the clerk as provided in section 4-102 of this Charter.
