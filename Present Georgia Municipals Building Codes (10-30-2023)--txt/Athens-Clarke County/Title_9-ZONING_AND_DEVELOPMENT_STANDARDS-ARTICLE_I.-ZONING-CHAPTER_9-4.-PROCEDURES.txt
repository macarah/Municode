B.
Type I zoning or planning actions—Generally:
1.
Scope—Every Type I application shall address the impact of the proposed change on the following as applicable:

2.
Except for special uses, which are subject to chapter 9-20, actions in subsection 9-4-3 A. shall be further evaluated under the following factors to balance the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of the property in issue:

Initiation of a Type I action may be made by:
a.
Recommendation of the planning commission or any department of Athens-Clarke County.
b.
Recommendation of the Athens-Clarke County Mayor and Commission.

d.
All persons wishing to speak longer than three minutes during one side's ten-minute argument period must register their intent to do so with the clerk of commission not later than the time of the meeting of the mayor and commission at which the final public hearing on the proposed rezoning is to be conducted is first called to order.
e.
In the event that all persons wishing to speak longer than three minutes as a part of one side's ten-minute argument are not able to agree how that side's ten-minute argument period shall be allocated, they shall inform the mayor of their disagreement before either side begins its ten-minute argument, in which event the mayor shall decide and announce the manner in which that side's ten-minute argument period shall be allocated. Any commissioner dissatisfied with the mayor's allocation of that side's ten-minute argument shall have the right to appeal the mayor's allocation decision to the commission before either side begins its ten-minute argument.

Sec. 9-4-10. - Administrative hearings.
A.
Administrative hearings shall be conducted for Type III and Type IV planning actions.

The burden shall be upon the applicant to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that all criteria for issuance of the requested action has been satisfied.
B.
In Type III proceedings, the planning commission shall conduct the hearing and act as decision-maker. A quorum shall consist of a majority of the total members on the planning commission. A majority vote of the planning commission members present and eligible to vote is required for action. In the event of a planning commission member's abstention based on conflict or other disqualification, the abstention shall count as if that member were absent and the number of persons necessary for a majority shall be reduced accordingly without affecting the quorum.
C.
Administrative hearings shall be conducted informally, but in such a manner as to preserve decorum at all times. The chairman, or in his/her absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, which shall be of public record. A written record of the hearing shall be prepared, either from notes taken by the secretary of the planning commission or hearings board, or by recording the proceedings. The record shall be an accurate account of the proceedings, including a listing of all documents considered, a summary of testimony presented, and any rulings upon motions or objections raised. The applicant or any other party to the proceeding may have a verbatim transcript prepared by an official court reporter, certified in the State of Georgia, at his or her own expense; provided, however, a copy of the transcript shall be filed with the secretary of the planning commission or hearings board and copies made available to other parties at actual cost. The planning commission or hearings board shall make the decision on the requested action based on the criteria found in the zoning ordinance and development ordinance.
D.
A written decision shall be issued by the planning commission or hearings board, containing findings and conclusions, either approving, approving with conditions, or denying the application. A decision shall be rendered within 10 business days after completion of the hearing, except the hearings board shall render its report within five business days.
E.
The planning commission members shall be governed by the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq, (chapter 67A, Conflict of Interest in Zoning Actions). The hearings board shall adopt similar conflict of interest provisions in their by-laws.
F.
In Type IV proceedings, the hearing shall be conducted by a hearings board, who shall act as decision-maker. A hearings board shall be composed of seven members. Members shall be appointed by the Athens-Clarke County Mayor and Commission. The term of office of the members of the board shall be four years or until their successors are appointed. No one may serve on the board more than two consecutive terms. In order to achieve staggered terms, initial appointments shall be: two members for two years; two members for three years; and three members for four years. Members of the board shall be removed for just cause by the commission upon written charges and after a public hearing. Vacancies caused by resignation or for other reasons shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as for a full term. None of the members of the board shall be employees or elected officials of Athens-Clarke County. Members of the board shall be reimbursed for travel expenses associated with their duties at a rate of $10.00 per meeting attended. The board shall elect one of its members as chair, who will serve for one year or until a successor is elected. The chair shall not serve more than two consecutive one-year terms as chair. The chair shall be a voting member, and a minimum of four affirmative votes by the membership of the board present and voting is needed to affirm a motion. To constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, there shall be required to be present at any meeting of the board at least five members. The Athens-Clarke County Planning Director or lawful designee shall serve as the board's secretary. The board shall adopt rules of procedure and by-laws not in conflict with the provisions of this title. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chair and at such other times as the board may determine. Regular meetings of the hearings boards shall be held monthly. Called meetings may be held as needed.

Sec. 9-4-13. - Conditional zoning procedure.
The planning staff or the planning commission may make a recommendation to the mayor and commission of Athens-Clarke County that certain conditions be added to a rezoning request so as to offset any adverse impacts to the community that may result from an approval. Such conditions shall be imposed when it benefits the neighbors or community as a whole as it would ameliorate the effects of the zoning change. These conditions shall relate to the land use plan and/or lessen the impact on public services and/or protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community.
The planning staff's or planning commission's report may recommend amendments to the applicant's request which would reduce the land area, change the district requested, and/or recommend conditions of rezoning which are deemed advisable so that the purpose of this title will be served and that health, safety and welfare of the public is secured.
The mayor and commission may also amend an application prior to acting thereon. Such amendment may reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the district requested, and add or delete conditions of rezoning so that the purpose of this title will be served and that the health, safety, and welfare of the public is secured.
In the event that the mayor and commission should determine that they will consider a zoning classification other than the classification requested by the applicant, then they shall cause legal notice to be given to the public of the zoning classification to be considered pursuant to the requirements of subsection 9-4-9 E.3.a. of this chapter. The public hearing on the request shall be continued until the next regular meeting of the mayor and commission.
