Sec. 6-6-7. - Street sales—Assigned locations.
(a)
Intent. The Commission of Athens-Clarke County finds and declares that a regulatory scheme for street sales by street merchants in the Athens Downtown Tax District, Farmers Market assigned locations, mobile food vendor unit designated areas, and on certain sections of Baldwin Street, Jackson Street, Baxter Street or other designated assigned areas would promote the public interest in that:
(1)
The Athens Downtown Tax District, particularly the area of College Avenue known as College Square, is a major public investment which revitalizes an important part of downtown Athens-Clarke County and that street merchants, subject to specific regulations, would contribute to furthering an attractive business and pedestrian environment for the general welfare of Athens-Clarke County.
(2)
The sections of Baldwin Street, Jackson Street and Baxter Street, as defined in this chapter, are located adjacent to an area of the University of Georgia that is heavily traveled by pedestrians and vehicles; that street merchants in that area provide a wholesome service to students and others seeking food or other goods offered by such merchants; and that additional specific regulations and restrictions for street merchants on Baldwin Street and Jackson Street would further promote the safety and welfare of persons in those areas.
(3)
The Farmers Market assigned locations, as defined in this chapter, are located in the Athens Downtown Tax District adjacent to City Hall in an area that is central to the downtown area; the Farmers Market in that area will provide a service to the public seeking raw or certain processed agricultural products, including fruits, vegetables, herbs, jams, jellies, meats, eggs, dairy products, etc.; and that additional specific regulations and restrictions for street merchants in the Farmers Market assigned locations would further promote the safety and welfare of persons in those areas.
(4)
Regulations, restrictions or prohibitions on street sales activities would promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Athens-Clarke County by abating acts, omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and the peace and dignity of Athens-Clarke County.
(5)
The mobile food vendor unit designated areas on public property, as defined in this chapter, are located in the Athens Downtown Tax District adjacent to City Hall in an area that is central to the downtown area, and at other designated public areas, that have frequent pedestrian activity; mobile food vendors in those areas will provide a service to the public seeking additional wholesome food and beverage options; and that specific regulations and restrictions for mobile food vendor units would further promote the safety and welfare of persons in those areas.
(b)
Approval locations. Street sales at assigned locations shall be permitted within the Athens Downtown Tax District, on Baldwin Street, Jackson Street and Baxter Street only at designated marked locations as determined by the manager. The manager shall be authorized to determine the locations where street sales may be conducted in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare and such locations shall be submitted to the Commission of Athens-Clarke County for approval. A current list of all such approved locations shall be appended by reference to this ordinance and may be revised from time to time as locations may be added, removed or altered by the commission.
(c)
Assignment of locations. The assignment of locations for street merchants shall be compatible with the public interest and use of sidewalk areas and public rights-of-ways and shall take into consideration the proximity of existing public and private property (benches, bus stop, loading zones, telephone booths, building entrances, display windows, vehicular and pedestrian traffic patterns, etc.), proximity to other assigned street merchant locations, and the like, in order to ensure that there will not be pedestrian and street congestion or obstruction and in order to contribute as effectively as possible to the intent of this section.
(d)
Assignment of other designated areas. The manager may from time to time designate assigned street merchant locations on property owned by Athens-Clarke County as special temporary circumstances may deem appropriate. Such additional locations may be assigned for periods not to exceed 21 days and each street merchant assigned such temporary location shall obtain a permit as required of any street merchant-assigned location.
(e)
No property rights conveyed. The assignment of an approved location for street sales pursuant to this section shall not be construed or interpreted to convey any property rights or any lease holder rights to any person.
(f)
Display; cart, stands, skirted tables:
(1)
Street sales permitted under this section shall not be conducted from any conveyance or in any mode other than from an approved mobile food vendor unit, cart, stand or skirted table as prescribed in this section. Grocery carts and wood or cardboard boxes are prohibited from being used as displays.
(2)
Any cart, stand or skirted table shall not be larger than four feet wide by six feet long and seven feet high, including all attachments, extensions and merchandise, except for Farmers Market assigned locations which must remain completely within their assigned area.
(3)
The total weight of a display, plus merchandise, shall not exceed 125 pounds per square foot.
(g)
Abandonment:
(1)
No assigned location may be left unoccupied by the permitted street merchant for more than 30 consecutive calendar days without the street merchant giving prior notification to the manager that such location will be vacant, the reason for such vacancy and for what period of time. Failure to provide such notice may cause the assigned location to be declared abandoned and assigned to another street merchant.
(2)
In the event that the manager has evidence that an assigned location has been abandoned, he shall give ten working days' notice to the street merchant, to the address on the street merchant's application, for a hearing before the administrative hearing officer to determine whether there has been an abandonment of the assigned location.
(h)
Street sales during special events. A street merchant at an assigned location in the district, including Farmers Market assigned locations, or on Baldwin Street, Baxter Street, or Jackson Street shall be provided the opportunity to remain at the assigned location and conduct business during any approved special event or festival. To ensure the public safety and welfare, any street merchant may be requested to relocate or adjust business operations to within a close reasonable proximity of the assigned location to accommodate any logistical or technical necessity. It shall be unlawful for a street merchant to refuse or fail to comply with such a request from the manager or a law enforcement officer.
(i)
Limitation of permits. No permit for street merchant-assigned location shall be issued to the same business or to the same individual for more than one location within the same block, including intersections with other streets, on College Avenue, Clayton Street, Lumpkin Street, or Washington Street in the Athens Downtown Tax District, or on Baldwin Street, Baxter Street or Jackson Street. Permits for contiguous locations may be issued to the same entity for Farmers Market assigned locations.
(j)
Liability and insurance.
(1)
Except for actions arising out of Athens-Clarke County's sole negligence, the permittee agrees to indemnify, defend, save, and hold harmless the Athens-Clarke County Government, its officers and employees, from any and all claims, liability, damages, and causes of action which may arise out of the permit or the permittee's activity. Proof of such waiver shall be filed with, and made a part of, the permit application form.
(2)
The permittee agrees to meet and maintain for the entire permit period, at its own expense, the following requirements:
(i)
Commercial general liability insurance in an amount to be determined by the manager for bodily injury and property damage. The Athens-Clarke County Government must be named as an additional insured on this policy, and an endorsement must be issued as part of the policy reflecting compliance with this requirement.
(ii)
The Athens-Clarke County Government must receive 30 days written notice prior to any cancellation, non-renewal, or material change in the coverage provided.
(3)
The permittee must provide an original certificate of insurance as evidence that the above requirements have been met prior to issuance of a permit.
(k)
It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in street sales to sell or offer for sale any goods, merchandise or services, or otherwise occupy the public right-of-way, within 150 feet of an active polling place as determined by state law or the Superintendent of Elections and Voter Registration.
