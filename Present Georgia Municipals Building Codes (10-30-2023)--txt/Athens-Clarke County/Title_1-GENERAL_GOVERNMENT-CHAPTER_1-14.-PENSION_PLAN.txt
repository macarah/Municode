Sec. 1-14-2. - Article II—Types of service.
For purposes of this plan, an employee's years of service with the employer shall be determined and reported by the administrator in accordance with the following:
1.
Continuous service. Continuous service shall be the period of uninterrupted employment of a participant with the employer.
2.
Credited service. A participant shall accrue credited service on the basis of the number of full years and fractions thereof to the nearest full month of service with the employer completed from his or her date of employment to his or her date of termination of employment.
Participants who were employees of the employer on January 14, 1991, and who were active employees of the City of Athens on January 13, 1991, will receive credit for the years of credited service earned under the City of Athens Employees' Pension Plan. If these participants were former employees of the Commissioners of the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, and are vested in the Clarke County Pension Plan, they will also receive credit for years of credited service earned under the Clarke County Pension Plan.
Participants who were employees of the employer on January 14, 1991, and who were active employees of the Board of Commissioners of Clarke County, Georgia, on January 13, 1991, will receive credit for the years of credited service earned under the Clarke County Employees' Pension Plan. If these participants were former employees of the City of Athens and are vested in the City of Athens Employees' Pension Plan, they will also receive credit for years of credited service earned under the City of Athens Employees' Pension Plan.
For the purpose of determining the number of whole years in accordance with this section, all portions of nonsuccessive periods of service that are less than whole years will be aggregated on the basis that 12 months of service equal a whole year of service.
3.
Leave of absence. A leave of absence shall consist of one of the following:
(a)
Absence, for reasons other than those specified in subsections 3(b) and 3(c) of this article II, with the consent of the administrator during a period not in excess of one year, except that the administrator may consent to extend the period of leave.

(c)
Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, effective December 12, 1994, vesting and benefit credit service shall be provided for periods of qualified military service in accordance with, and to the extent required by, section 414(u) of the code.
In interpreting this subsection 3, the administrator will apply uniform rules in a like manner to all participants under similar circumstances.
4.
A participant shall not receive credited service in the case of any of the periods of absence set forth in subsection 3(a) above, but shall retain credited service accrued prior to such absence. Upon return to employment after an approved absence, the participant will again accrue credited service. A participant shall receive credited service for any period of absence set forth in subsections 3(b) and 3(c) above.
5.
Credited service granted under article XIV, section 3 will be used for benefit calculation purposes upon return to active employment from permanent and total disability status.

Conversion of sick leave to credited service. Effective for pensions commencing on or after July 1, 2005, at the request, and in accordance with the election, of a participant in connection with his or her application for retirement benefits, unused accrued sick leave shall be converted to credited service solely for purposes of determining the participant's benefit in one of the following ways:
(a)
Converted into an equivalent number of months and added to the total credited service; or
(b)
Converted into an equivalent number of months and added to the age of the participant.
For this purpose, the participant will be credited with one month of credited service or age for every 20 days of unused accrued sick leave.
Unused sick leave accruals may not be used for increasing a participant's credited service for purposes of vesting in a benefit or increasing a participant's age or credited service for purposes of qualifying for an early retirement.
Once unused accrued sick leave is applied toward credited service or age, any unused sick leave balance will not be eligible for monetary compensation. No other leave, accrued holiday, or compensatory time may be applied toward credited service or age for retirement purposes.

Sec. 1-14-5. - Article V—Accrued benefits and retirement benefits.
1.
Accrued benefits.
(a)
(1)
Effective for participants employed by the employer on or after July 1, 2013, the retirement benefit, payable as a single life annuity, for a participant shall be determined as of any date by multiplying the participant's average monthly earnings times 1.85 percent for each year of credited service up to and including 32 years (a maximum of 32 x 1.85% = 59.20%). If such participant has more than 32 years of credited service, the retirement benefits shall be the product determined in the previous sentence plus the product determined by multiplying ¼ of one percent (0.25%) by each year of credited service in excess of 32 years by the participant's average monthly earnings.
(2)
For participants who were last employed by the employer prior to July 1, 2013 but were active participants on or after July 1, 2007, the retirement benefit, payable as a single life annuity, for a participant shall be determined as of any date by multiplying the participant's average monthly earnings times 1.85 percent for each year of credited service up to and including 31 years (a maximum of 31 × 1.85% = 57.35%). If such participant has more than 31 years of credited service, the retirement benefits shall be the product determined in the previous sentence plus the product determined by multiplying ¼ of one percent (0.25%) by each year of credited service in excess of 31 years by the participant's average monthly earnings.
(3)
For participants who were last employed by the employer prior to July 1, 2007 but were active participants on or after July 1, 2001, the retirement benefit, payable as a single life annuity, for a participant shall be determined as of any date by multiplying the participant's average monthly earnings times 1.85 percent for each year of credited service up to and including 30 years (a maximum of 30 x 1.85% = 55.50%). If such participant has more than 30 years of credited service, the retirement benefits shall be the product determined in the previous sentence plus the product determined by multiplying ¼ of one percent (.25%) by each year of credited service in excess of 30 years by the participant's average month earnings.
(4)
For participants who were last employed by the employer prior to July 1, 2001 but were active participants on or after July 1, 1999, the retirement benefit, payable as a single life annuity, for a participant shall be determined as of any date by multiplying the participant's average monthly earnings times 1.80 percent for each year of credited service up to and including 30 years (a maximum of 30 x 1.80% = 54.00%). If such participant has more than 30 years of credited service, the retirement benefits shall be the product determined in the previous sentence plus the product determined by multiplying ¼ of one percent (.25%) by each year of credited service in excess of 30 years by the participant's average month earnings.
(5)
For participants who were last employed by the employer prior to July 1, 1999, but were active participants on or after July 1, 1997, the retirement benefit, payable as a single life annuity, for a participant shall be determined as of any date by multiplying the participant's average monthly earnings times 1.60 percent for each year of credited service up to and including 30 years (a maximum of 30 x 1.60% = 48.00%). If such participant has more than 30 years of credited service, the retirement benefits shall be the product determined in the previous sentence plus the product determined by multiplying ¼ of one percent (.25%) by each year of credited service in excess of 30 years by the participant's average month earnings.
(6)
For participants who were last employed by the employer prior to July 1, 1997, but were active participants on or after unification (i.e., the formation of the Athens-Clarke Unified Government), the retirement benefit, payable as a single life annuity, for a participant shall be determined as of any date by multiplying the participant's average monthly earnings times 1.60 percent for each year of credited service up to and including 25 years (a maximum of 25 x 1.60% = 40.00%). If such participant has more than 25 years of credited service, the retirement benefits shall be the product determined in the previous sentence plus the product determined by multiplying ¼ of one percent (.25%) by each year of credited service in excess of 25 years by the participant's average month earnings.
(7)
In no event, however, shall the monthly accrued benefit as of any date of determination be less than $20.00.
(b)
In the event a participant terminates covered employment and is subsequently re-employed before such participant's annuity starting date (as defined in article VI hereunder), the accrued benefit of the participant shall be determined by applying the current benefit formula to all years of credited service, whenever worked, subject to the eligibility and other requirements of the plan at the time the work was performed.
(c)
In computing the monthly accrued benefit, it will be assumed that such benefit shall be payable in accordance with the terms of the life annuity form as set forth in subsection (1)(a) of article VI. Benefits payable in accordance with any other form will be actuarially adjusted to reflect the difference in the value of the form of payment chosen hereunder as compared to the life annuity form.
(d)
The annual accrued benefit as of any determination date shall be 12 times the monthly accrued benefit as determined above.
2.
Normal retirement benefit. The monthly amount of normal retirement benefit payable to a participant retiring on his or her normal retirement date shall be equal to the greater of his or her monthly accrued benefit determined as of such participant's normal retirement date or his or her early retirement benefit.
3.
Early retirement benefit. The monthly amount of early retirement benefit payable to a participant retiring on his or her early retirement date shall be equal to his or her nonforfeitable monthly accrued benefit determined as of such early retirement date reduced by one-third of one percent (.0033⅓) for each month by which the commencement of benefit payments precedes normal retirement date.
4.
Deferred retirement benefit. In the case of a participant who is employed by the employer beyond his or her normal retirement date, the monthly amount of deferred retirement benefit payable to a participant retiring on his or her deferred retirement date shall be equal to his or her monthly accrued benefit determined as of such participant's deferred retirement date, adjusted for form of payment in accordance with article VI.
No amendment to the deferred retirement benefit provisions shall have the effect of decreasing a participant's deferred retirement benefit determined (without regard to such amendment) as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted or becomes effective.
5.
Pension payment requirements.
(a)
To qualify for a pension under the plan a participant must terminate employment with the employer and apply for a pension by completing and returning all forms required by the employer. Such forms, and all other forms as may be required in connection with the administration of the plan, may be provided, completed, and returned in electronic form, provided the participant (or beneficiary) has consented to using such processes and all required electronic signatures are provided in a manner that complies with applicable law.
(b)
A participant may continue in the employ of the employer beyond his or her normal retirement date, in which event, the participant shall continue to accrue benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan.
(c)
Once a participant has had a bona fide retirement and commenced his or her pension under the plan, such retiree is prohibited from subsequently working for the employer more than 1,040 hours in any fiscal year. Such subsequent employment shall not qualify for pension eligibility or additional benefits under the plan.
6.
Maximum retirement benefits. In accordance with the benefit limitations of section 415 of the Code, each participant's annual benefit shall be limited so that the specified maximum permissible benefit, as defined herein, is not exceeded. If necessary, the participant's accrued benefit shall be limited in order to meet the requirements of section 415 of the Code.
With respect to each participant, all qualified defined benefit plans ever maintained by the employer shall be treated as one defined benefit plan and all qualified defined contribution plans ever maintained by the employer shall be treated as one defined contribution plan for purposes of applying the limitations of section 415 of the Code. In the event the participant's annual benefit from all such plans exceeds the maximum permissible benefit specified herein, the participant's accrued benefit shall be reduced to the extent necessary under this plan if the required reduction is not accomplished under the employer's other qualified defined benefit plan(s).
The following definitions shall be used solely for the purposes of this subsection (7):
(a)
[Reserved]
(b)
Annual benefit means the amount of accrued benefit attributable to employer contributions which would be payable annually in the form of a single life annuity as of the date of determination; except, however, that if the participant has not yet terminated employment with the employer and has not yet reached his or her normal retirement age, the annual benefit shall mean the amount of accrued benefit attributable to employer contributions projected to such participant's normal retirement age assuming the participant will continue working and compensation will remain the same until the participant's normal retirement age.
(c)
[Reserved]
(d)
Qualified Public Safety Participant shall mean a participant with respect to whom the period of service taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under this plan includes at least 15 years of credited service of the participant as a full-time employee of any police department or fire department which is organized and operated by the employer to provide police protection, firefighting services, or emergency medical services or as a member of the armed forces of the United States.
(e)
[Reserved]
(f)
[Reserved]
(g)
Limitation year means a plan year for this plan.
(h)

Effective for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 1995, notwithstanding anything in this plan to the contrary, to the extent a participant's benefit is subject to the provisions of section 415 of the code, which have not been set forth in the plan, such code provisions, and regulations and guidance issued thereunder, are hereby incorporated by reference into this plan and for all purposes shall be deemed a part of the plan.
(j)
Participation service means an accrual computation period for which the following conditions are met: (1) the participant is credited with at least the number of hours of service (or period of service if the elapsed time method is used), for benefit accrual purposes, required under the terms of the plan in order to accrue a benefit for the accrual computation period, and (2) the participant is included in the plan for at least one day of the accrual computation period. If these two conditions are met, participation service credited to the participant hereunder shall equal the amount of benefit accrual service credited to the participant for such accrual computation period. A participant who is permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) of the Code during an accrual computation period shall receive participation service with respect to that period.

Annuity starting date is the first day of the first period for which an amount is paid as an annuity or any other form. For purposes of determining a participant's annuity starting date, the payment of any disability benefits pursuant to article XIV shall be disregarded. In the case of an annuity starting date that occurs on or after the participant's normal retirement age, such date shall apply to any additional benefit accruals after the annuity starting date. In the case of an annuity starting date that occurs prior to the participant's normal retirement age, such date shall not apply to any additional benefit accruals after the annuity starting date.
(d)
Earliest retirement age means the earliest early retirement date on which, under the plan, a participant who separates from service (including death) could receive retirement benefits assuming, if appropriate under the circumstances, he or she would have survived to such date or, in the case of a participant who separates from service (including death) and who would not be eligible to receive retirement benefits on an early retirement date, his or her normal retirement age.
2.
Automatic form of retirement benefit. Except as provided in section 2 of article XIII, a participant's vested accrued benefit will be paid in the normal form of retirement benefit, subject to the spousal written consent requirements, unless an optional annuity form is selected. In addition to the optional forms below, a married vested participant may elect a single life annuity with the written consent of his or her spouse.
3.
Optional annuity forms of payment: Except as otherwise specified in paragraph 3(a)(1) of this article VI, all optional annuity forms of payment are actuarially equivalent to the single life annuity.
(a)
Life annuity with guarantee of 120 monthly payments:
(1)
The life annuity with 120 monthly payments guaranteed form would provide for a benefit that is the actuarial equivalent of the accrued benefit as determined in section 1 of article V. Such benefit shall be payable to the retired participant during his or her lifetime with the guarantee that not less than 120 monthly retirement benefit payments will be made to the retired participant and his or her named beneficiary.
(2)
If this form is elected and the retired participant dies prior to the receipt of 120 monthly payments, the balance of the guaranteed number of monthly payments will be paid to the retired participant's named beneficiary until the total of 120 monthly payments has been made to the retired participant and his or her named beneficiary. The first such payment to the beneficiary shall be due and payable as of the first day of the month following the retired participant's death.
(3)
In the event there is no named beneficiary living at the death of the retired participant, the balance of the guaranteed number of monthly payments, which would otherwise have become payable to the retired participant's beneficiary, shall be commuted to a single sum and shall be paid to the executors or administrators of the retired participant's estate.
(4)
If the beneficiary of a deceased retired participant should die prior to receiving the balance of the guaranteed number of monthly payments, the balance of the guaranteed number of monthly payments, which would otherwise have become payable to the retired participant's beneficiary, shall be commuted to a single sum and shall be paid to the beneficiary's executors or administrators of the beneficiary's estate.
(5)
No monthly benefit will be payable under this form to a beneficiary if the participant dies before his or her annuity starting date.
(b)
Contingent annuitant option:
(1)
In lieu of the automatic form of retirement benefit called for in section 2 of article VI, a participant may elect a contingent annuitant option which provides a benefit that is the actuarial equivalent of the single life annuity that is payable to the retired participant during his or her lifetime and for the continuance of such retirement benefits in 50 percent, 75 percent, or 100 percent of such amount to a contingent annuitant, if living, after the retired participant's death.
(2)
The monthly payment to the contingent annuitant shall commence on the first day of the month following the month in which the retired participant dies, if the contingent annuitant is then living, and shall continue monthly with the last payment due for the month in which the contingent annuitant's death occurs.
(3)
If a contingent annuitant dies before the participant's annuity starting date is attained, the normal form of retirement benefit payments will, if applicable, automatically become payable as if a contingent annuitant option had not been elected, unless the participant designates another contingent annuitant prior to the participant's annuity starting date, in accordance with procedures of the employer. If the contingent annuitant predeceases the retired participant on or after the annuity starting date, the retirement benefit payments will cease upon the retired participant's death.
(4)
No monthly benefit will be payable under this form to a contingent annuitant if the participant dies before his or her annuity starting date.
(c)
Life annuity with guaranteed monthly payments:
(1)
In lieu of the automatic form of retirement benefit called for in section 2 of article VI, a participant may elect a life annuity with either 60 or 180 monthly payments guaranteed. This form would provide for an actuarially equivalent retirement benefit payable to the retired participant during his or her lifetime with the guarantee that not less than a total of the specified number of monthly retirement benefit payments will be made to the retired participant and his or her named beneficiary.
(2)
If this form is elected and the retired participant dies prior to the receipt of the specified number of monthly payments, the balance of the guaranteed number of monthly payments will be paid to the retired participant's named beneficiary until the total of the specified number of monthly payments has been made to the retired participant and his or her named beneficiary. The first such payment to the beneficiary shall be due and payable as of the first day of the month following the retired participant's death.
(3)
In the event there is no named beneficiary living at the death of the retired participant, the balance of the specified number of guaranteed monthly payments, which would otherwise have become payable to the retired participant's beneficiary, shall be commuted to a single sum and shall be paid to the executors or administrators of the retired participant's estate.
(4)
If the beneficiary of a deceased retired participant should die prior to receiving the balance of the specified number of guaranteed monthly payments, the balance of the specified number of guaranteed monthly payments, which would otherwise have become payable to the retired participant's beneficiary, shall be commuted to a single sum and shall be paid to the beneficiary's executors or administrators of the beneficiary's estate.
(5)
No monthly benefit will be payable under this form to a beneficiary if the participant dies before his or her annuity starting date.
(d)
Election of optional annuity forms. A participant may elect any optional annuity form by written notice to the administrator at any time prior to his or her annuity starting date; provided, however, that the election of an optional annuity form by a married participant is subject to the spousal written waiver requirements set forth in subsection 1(a) of article VI. Such election must indicate that the participant has revoked the automatic form of retirement benefit as it pertains to him or her, and that in its place has elected the optional annuity form chosen by him or her. An election of an optional annuity form may be revoked in writing by the participant at any time prior to his or her annuity starting date. In no event shall the consent of any person entitled to receive payments upon the death of the participant be required as a condition to the right of a participant to revoke any option previously elected. After an optional annuity form has been revoked, another election of an optional annuity form may be made, subject to the spousal written consent requirement for a married participant.
4.
Death benefit:
(a)
(1)
If a participant who has a nonforfeitable benefit and who has not yet attained his or her annuity starting date dies on or before his or her earliest retirement age, the participant's spouse (if any) will receive 50 percent of the retirement benefit that would be payable if the participant had:
(i)
Separated from service at the earlier of the actual time of separation or the date of death;
(ii)
Survived to the earliest retirement age and;
(iii)
Retired with a life annuity at the earliest retirement age.
(2)
This death benefit shall be payable to the spouse (if any) of a deceased participant beginning no earlier than the first of the month following the month the participant would have attained his or her earliest retirement age.
(3)
This benefit will be paid to the earlier of:
(i)
The death of the surviving spouse; or
(ii)
The date of remarriage of the surviving spouse.
(b)
If a vested participant for whom benefits are payable in accordance with section 2 of this article VI should die during his or her service with the employer or, on or after January 1, 2007, while absent on account of qualified military service (as defined in section 414(u) of the Code), after his or her earliest retirement age and before his or her normal retirement date, then the spouse shall be entitled to a benefit of 50 percent of the participant's early retirement benefit based upon the employee's years of service through the day on which death occurred. The same shall be computed as if such deceased participant retired with a single life annuity on the first day of the month preceding death. This benefit, which shall be payable as of the first of the month following the month of the participant's death, shall be paid to the earlier of:
(1)
The death of the surviving spouse; or
(2)
To the date of remarriage of the surviving spouse;
provided, that this death benefit payable above shall not be given unless it is greater than any other benefit provided for by the plan and shall not be given in addition to any other benefit provided thereby.
(c)
If a vested participant for whom benefits are payable in accordance with section 2 of this article VI should die during his or her service with the employer after his or her normal retirement date, then the spouse shall be entitled to a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to the employee's vested benefit at date of death based upon the participant's years of service through the month in which his or her death occurred. The same shall be computed as if such deceased participant retired at the first of the month preceding death. This benefit shall be paid to the earliest of:
(1)
120 monthly payments;
(2)
The death of the surviving spouse; or
(3)
The date of remarriage of the surviving spouse;
provided, that this death benefit payable above shall not be given unless it is greater than any other benefit provided for by the plan and shall not be given in addition to any other benefit provided thereby.
(d)
Notwithstanding the provisions set forth above, a vested employee's legal dependent child shall become his or her beneficiary, if there is no spouse, in the event a vested participant dies while an employee. The legal dependent child shall be eligible for benefits commencing the month following the death of the employee-parent and continuing monthly until reaching his or her 19th birthday, unless said child is a full-time student at a postsecondary institution of higher education, which status would allow this benefit to continue until the maximum age of 25. The amount of the monthly benefit is 50 percent of the monthly accrued benefit the employee would have received at age 55 or at date of death, if later, as a single life annuity. For families with more than one legal dependent child, the monthly benefit shall be divided equally among the legal dependent children with the same age restrictions for each child. As each child reaches the age of 19 or 25 based on the above age requirements, said benefits shall cease, and the remaining legal dependent children shall begin to receive the benefits previously allocated to those children who no longer qualify (because of age, death, or cannot be located) for such benefits divided equally among those children who are still qualified for the benefit.
For the purposes of this paragraph, legal dependent child means a child of a deceased participant as determined in accordance with Georgia law who shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon the deceased participant at the time of such participant's death if the child is neither married nor emancipated by court order and either under the age of 19 or under the age of 25 or continuously enrolled as a full-time student in a postsecondary institution of higher education.
5.
Required distributions—Code section 401(a)(9). Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, distributions under this article VI made on or after January 1, 2006 shall be made in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and the provisions of this section 5. Definitions of certain terms used in this section 5 are set forth in subsection (e) hereof.
(a)
Time and manner of distribution.
(1)
Required beginning date. The participant's entire benefit shall be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required beginning date.
(2)
Death of participant before distributions begin. If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
(i)
If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole beneficiary, distributions to the surviving spouse shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70½, if later.
(ii)
If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole beneficiary, distributions to the designated beneficiary shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died.
(iii)
If there is no beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, the participant's entire benefit shall be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
(iv)
If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, paragraph 5(a)(2), other than subparagraph 5(a)(2)(i) above, shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the participant.
For purposes of this paragraph 5(a)(2) and subsection 5(d) below, distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date (or if subparagraph 5(a)(2)(iv) above applies, the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subparagraph 5(a)(2)(i) above). If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the participant before the participant's required beginning date (or to the participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subparagraph 5(a)(2)(i) above), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
(3)
Form of distribution. Unless a participant's benefit is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, or in a single sum as specified in section 2 of article XIII, as of the first distribution calendar year, distributions will be made in accordance with subsections 5(b), 5(c) and 5(d) below. If the participant's benefit is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations.
(b)
Determination of amount to be distributed each year.
(1)
General annuity requirements. If the participant's benefit is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity shall satisfy the following requirements:
(i)
the annuity distributions shall be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;
(ii)
the distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain not longer than the period described in subsections 5(c) and 5(d);
(iii)
once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted; and
(iv)
payments will either be nonincreasing or increase only as follows: (A) by an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; (B) to the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was used to determine the distribution period described in subsection 5(c) dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the Code; and (C) to pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment.
(2)
Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subparagraphs 5(a)(2)(i) or 5(a)(2)(ii)) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year shall be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date.
(3)
Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year shall be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.
(c)
Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during a participant's lifetime.
(1)
Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the participant's benefit is to be distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of U.S. Treasury Regulations.
(2)
Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of U.S. Treasury Regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of U.S. Treasury Regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date.
(d)
Requirements for minimum distributions where participant dies before date distributions begin.
(1)
Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his benefit begins and there is a beneficiary, the participant's entire benefit shall be distributed beginning no later than the time described in subparagraphs 5(a)(2)(i) or 5(a)(2)(ii), over the life of the beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding:
(i)
unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the participant's death; or
(ii)
if the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.
(2)
No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
(3)
Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his benefit begins, the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection 5(d) shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the participant, except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to subparagraph 5(a)(2)(i).
(e)
Definitions. For purposes of this section 5, the following definitions shall apply:
(1)
Designated beneficiary means the individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and who is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of U.S. Treasury Regulations.
(2)
Distribution calendar year means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to subparagraph 5(a)(2)(i) of article VI.
(3)
Life expectancy means the life expectancy computed by use of the Single Life Table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of U.S. Treasury Regulations.
(4)
Required beginning date means April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant attains age 70½ or retires, whichever is later.
6.
Actuarial equivalent or actuarially equivalent. The amount of benefit payable in any form of benefit other than the single life annuity form shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount payable in the single life annuity form. Actuarial equivalent shall be the adjusted benefit payable hereunder as of any participant's retirement date which would provide for equality in value of the aggregate amount expected to be received under the single life annuity form as compared to the value of the aggregate amount expected to be received under another form of benefit. The actuarial equivalent shall be determined without regard to the participant's sex and based upon seven percent interest and the 1989 Unisex #3 Basis; Longer Life Annuity factors. In no event shall an amendment to the actuarial equivalent benefit provisions deprive a participant of his actuarial equivalent benefit so determined to the later of the effective date or adoption date of any such amendment. Should an amendment be adopted which directly or indirectly affects the computation of a participant's actuarial equivalent benefit, such participant's actuarial equivalent benefit so determined shall be equal to or greater than the actuarial equivalent benefit determined (without regard to such amendment) as of the later of the effective date or adoption date of the amendment.
( Ord. of 9-18-2014 , § 1 (Exh. A))
Sec. 1-14-7. - Article VII—Vesting and transfer of employment.
1.
Vesting; entitlement to monthly accrued benefit. A participant shall be fully vested in his monthly accrued benefit upon attaining his normal retirement date as set forth in article IV, and upon termination of employment thereafter he or she shall be entitled to receive his monthly accrued benefit determined as of the date of his termination of employment.
2.
Forfeiture of benefit rights and vesting schedule for charter officers.
(a)
Forfeiture of benefit rights upon termination of employment prior to ten years' consecutive service or partial vesting as a charter officer. A participant whose employment with the employer is terminated prior to his or her normal retirement date and who has less than ten consecutive years of credited service, as defined in section 5 of this article VII, with the employer at the date of termination of employment will forfeit all rights to benefits under this plan, unless the charter officer is at least partially vested. For purposes of consecutive years of service in the previous sentence, a period of approved leave of up to one year, Family Medical Leave Act leave, and qualified military service leave shall not be deemed an interruption of consecutive years of credited service.
(b)
Vesting schedule for charter officers.
(1)
An individual who becomes a charter officer after July 1, 2015, and who elects to participate in the County's Pension Plan shall be subject to the following vesting schedule, based upon his or her total consecutive years of credited service earned in County employment:
EXPAND
Completed Consecutive Years of Credited Service Vested Percentage
0—4 0%
5 50%
6 60%
7 70%
8 80%
9 90%
10 100%
  (2)
An employee serving in an acting charter officer position will not be subject to the above vesting schedule; however, if an employee was in an acting charter officer position and, without interruption, becomes a permanent charter officer, the period as acting charter officer shall be included in the computation of completed years of credited service.
(3)
If an employee ceases to be a charter officer but continues to be an employee, his or her vesting percentage shall be frozen and shall not increase until and unless the employee accumulates ten consecutive years of credited service at which time the employee shall be fully vested in his or her accrued benefit.
(4)
If a charter officer terminates employment after becoming partially vested, his or her vested benefit (i.e., the product of the vested percentage and the benefit accrued) shall be fixed. Upon subsequent non-consecutive reemployment, the individual shall be treated as a new employee, with a new hire date, for purposes of accruing benefits and earning nonforfeitable benefits.
3.
Retention of benefit rights upon termination of employment after ten years' service or after becoming partially vested as a charter officer. A participant whose employment with the employer is terminated prior to his or her normal retirement date and who has completed ten consecutive years of credited service, as defined in section 5 of this article VII, shall retain a nonforfeitable right to his monthly accrued benefit as of his or her date of termination of employment. Notwithstanding the preceding, a charter officer who is partially vested shall retain a nonforfeitable right in his or her vested percentage of monthly accrued benefit (i.e., vested percentage multiplied by accrued benefit) as of his or her date of termination of employment.
4.
No nonforfeitable rights when termination of employment caused by death or participant dies subsequent to termination and prior to early or normal retirement dates. Should a participant's termination of employment with the employer be caused by the participant's death or should the participant die subsequent to his or her date of termination and prior to his early retirement date or normal retirement date, he or she shall not, in the absence of any contrary provision of article VI, retain any nonforfeitable rights hereunder.
5.
Ten consecutive years of credited service. Solely for purposes of this article VII, the term "ten consecutive years of credited service" means ten consecutive years of full-time active employment with the employer, except that (a) the following periods of absence shall be included and deemed a part of consecutive years of credited service for such purposes: (1) any period of paid leave, including short-term and long-term disability, (2) any period for which Workers' Compensation is paid, and (3) any period of qualified military service as set forth in subsection 3(c) of article II; (b) the following periods of absence shall not break otherwise consecutive periods of active full-time employment: (1) any approved unpaid leave not listed in subsection 5(a) of this article VII, which does not exceed one year (unless an extension is approved by the employer), and (2) any period of Family Medical Leave Act leave; and (c) any other period of absence or period subsequent to a termination of employment shall constitute a break in consecutive years of credited service.
6.
Authorization to elect early retirement benefit. Subject to the provisions of section 2 of article XIII, if a participant meets the years of credited service requirement as set forth in section 2 of article IV at the date of his or her termination of employment, such participant may elect, in lieu of a benefit payable on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his normal retirement age, to receive a benefit payable on an early retirement date. Such early retirement benefit will be payable in accordance with section 3 of article V and will be payable in a form as determined in accordance with article VI.
7.
Amendments to vesting provisions not to deprive of nonforfeitable rights. No amendment to the vesting provisions shall deprive a participant of his nonforfeitable right accrued (without regard to such amendment) as of the later of the adoption date or effective date of the amendment.
8.
Determination of accrued benefits and nonforfeitable rights in accordance with plan in effect on date of termination of employment. A participant who terminates employment shall have his or her accrued benefits and nonforfeitable right to a retirement benefit hereunder determined in accordance with the provisions of the plan in effect as of the date of such participant's termination of employment.
9.
Transfer of employment. Should a participant's employment with the employer be transferred to an employment classification other than the specified employment classification as set forth in article III, such participant shall not accrue credited service for any purposes of this plan during such period.
If such participant shall, prior to termination of his employment or actual retirement, be reinstated in the employment classification as set forth in article III, he or she shall retain all credited service accrued prior to his or her transfer date and shall commence to accrue additional credited service under the plan. Upon termination of his or her employment, such participant's retirement benefit shall be based on his or her total credited service accrued as a participant under this plan only.
If such participant shall accrue credited service under any other qualified defined benefit pension plan of the employer for any period during which he or she was not employed in the employment classification as set forth in article III and is not reinstated in the employment classification as set forth in article III at the time he or she should subsequently become eligible for retirement benefits hereunder, such participant's retirement benefit shall be based on his or her accrued benefit (as defined in the plan as of the date of transfer) using his or her total credited service accrued as a participant under this plan only. No participant shall be eligible to receive retirement benefits under the plan for any period of credited service for which he or she is receiving retirement benefits under such other plan of the employer.
Notwithstanding section 2 of article II, should a participant's employment with the employer be transferred into the specified employment classification as set forth in article III, such participant's retirement benefit shall be based on his accrued benefit using his total credited service accrued as a participant from the date he or she is transferred into the specified employment classification as set forth in article III. No participant shall be eligible to receive retirement benefits under the plan for any period of credited service for which he or she is receiving retirement benefits under another plan of the employer.

Interest of individuals in contributed funds.

2.
The administrator shall have the discretion and authority and responsibility to determine the benefits payable under this plan; shall administer the plan in accordance with the terms of the plan; shall have the power to determine all questions arising in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the terms of this plan, including without limitation, questions of eligibility for participation, eligibility for benefits, amount of accrued benefit, and the timing of the distribution thereof (subject to the provision that such power shall be consistently applied in a nondiscriminatory manner among all participants). All such interpretations, constructions and corrections of plan provisions shall be final and binding upon all parties, including without limitation the employer, employees and their families, dependents, and beneficiaries. The administrator may require participants to apply in writing to the administrator for benefits hereunder and to furnish satisfactory evidence of their date of birth and marital status and such other information as deemed advisable by approval of the Mayor and Commission.
3.
If a participant's application for retirement benefits has been rejected by the administrator, then the administrator shall notify the participant of such rejection in writing, setting forth the specific reasons for such rejection. Such written explanation shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.
4.
The Administrator shall also afford to any participant whose claim for pension benefits has been denied a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the decision to deny pension benefits in accordance with the procedures set forth below:
(a)
Within ten working days from the date of the initial decision by the Human Resources staff who assist in administration of the Plan, which decision shall be confirmed in writing by staff, a participant seeking to contest or appeal the staff decision shall submit to the Administrator an appeal in writing that states the specific claim and relief desired to be considered by the Administrator. Within ten working days from the filing of the appeal, the Administrator will provide a written response to the participant.
(b)
If the participant is not satisfied with the Administrator's decision, within ten working days from the date of the Administrator's decision, the participant may file with the Administrator a request for review of the decision by the Manager. Within 20 working days after reviewing a request to hear an appeal, the Manager, or designee, will acknowledge receipt and schedule a meeting to review the facts or will respond in writing, at his/her discretion. The Manager's review will include a review of the law, the facts, the circumstances, the findings, and the Administrator's decision. The relevant law, facts and circumstances, findings and decisions will be summarized and presented to the Manager or designee by the Administrator.

Following a desk review of the information presented in writing by the Administrator and the participant, the Manager or designee, may at his discretion schedule a meeting with the parties to clarify any issues in question in order to have complete information before making a decision. The written decision of the Manager to confirm or overturn the Administrator's decision shall be the final decision of the Unified Government of Athens-Clarke County.

Sec. 1-14-10. - Article X—Discontinuance of employer contributions, plan amendments and mergers.
1.
The employer intends to continue its sponsorship of this plan and payment of contributions to this plan indefinitely; but continuance of such sponsorship and such contributions is not assumed as a contractual obligation, or other obligation, of the employer and the right is reserved by the employer to cease its sponsorship of this plan or to reduce, suspend, or discontinue its contributions hereunder at any time. In the event of a suspension of contributions which ripens into a discontinuance, such discontinuance shall be retroactive to the date the last suspension of contributions commenced.
2.
The plan may be amended at any time and to any extent by approval of the Mayor and Commission. No such amendment, however, shall:
(a)
Vest in the employer any interest in the funds accumulated in accordance with this plan or the retirement benefits provided hereunder; or
(b)
Deprive any participant who has retired under this plan prior to the date of amendment, of any retirement benefit under this plan or change the provisions thereof; provided, however, that any change or modification for the purpose of conforming this plan to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States or of any other pertinent provisions of Federal or State Law, or of any regulation or ruling of any duly constituted authority in connection therewith, may be made effective at any time with retroactive effect; or
(c)
[Reserved]
(d)
Be effective to the extent that any change contained therein (including a change in the actuarial basis for determining optional or early retirement benefits) has the effect of decreasing a participant's accrued benefit determined (without regard to such amendment) as of the later of the adoption date or effective date of the amendment. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a participant's accrued benefit may be reduced to the extent permitted under section 412(c)(8) of the Code or under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, as if such law were applicable. For purposes of this subparagraph (d), an amendment which has the effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit, a retirement-type subsidy, or an optional form of benefit, with respect to benefits accrued before the later of the amendment's effective date or adoption date, shall be treated as impermissibly reducing a participant's accrued benefit. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the pre-amendment conditions for the subsidy. In general, a retirement-type subsidy is a subsidy that continues after retirement, but does not include a qualified disability benefit, a medical benefit, a social security supplement, or a death benefit (including life insurance).

Sec. 1-14-11. - Article XI—Plan termination procedures.
1.
If the plan is terminated or the employer permanently ceases to contribute to the plan, each participant shall be vested to the extent funded, and the assets of this plan available to provide benefits shall be allocated in a fair and equitable manner among those participants, spouses and beneficiaries affected by such termination. An allocation of assets as though the plan were subject to section 4044 of ERISA shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section 1 of article XI.
2.
Any assets of this plan which remain after provision has been made to satisfy all liabilities of this plan, unless in contravention of any provisions of law, shall be distributed to the employer.
( Ord. of 9-18-2014 , § 1 (Exh. A))
Sec. 1-14-12. - Article XII—[Reserved].
Sec. 1-14-13. - Article XIII—Miscellaneous.
1.
Inclusion in plan construes no right of employment or claims or interest in benefits. Inclusion in this plan shall not be construed as giving the participant any right to be retained in the service of the employer without the employer's consent, nor shall it interfere with the right of the employer to discharge the participant, nor shall it give the participant any right, claim or interest in any retirement benefits herein described except upon fulfillment of the provisions and requirements of this plan.
2.
Lump sum settlements. This section 2 of article XIII is deleted effective January 1, 2006.
(a)
If a vested participant terminates employment, and the present value of such participant's nonforfeitable accrued benefit does not exceed (or at the time of any prior distribution did not exceed) $3,500.00, the participant or the person designated by him to receive payments upon his death, if applicable, shall receive a lump sum settlement of such present value and any nonvested portion of his accrued benefit will be forfeited. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the present value of a participant's vested accrued benefit is zero, the participant shall be deemed to have received a lump sum settlement of such present value. For purposes of this section, a participant receiving disability benefits pursuant to the provisions of this plan shall be deemed to have terminated employment upon attainment of his normal retirement date. No distribution may be made under the preceding provisions of this section 2 after a participant's annuity starting date unless the participant and, if applicable, his spouse (or where the participant has died, the surviving spouse) consent to such distribution within 90 days of the distribution date. For purposes of this section 2, "annuity starting date" and "spouse" shall have the respective meaning set forth in article VI hereunder. A lump sum settlement shall be made any time after the participant's termination of participation but prior to the close of the second plan year following the plan year in which the termination occurs, even though the participant or the person designated by him to receive payments upon his death, if applicable, is not otherwise entitled to commencement of benefit payments at such time under other provisions of the plan.
(b)
For purposes of this section, "termination of participation" shall mean:
(1)
The day such lump sum is distributed for all participants who terminated employment prior to July 7, 1992; provided, that such distribution occurs prior to July 8, 1993; or
(2)
The day employment is terminated for all participants who terminated employment on or subsequent to July 7, 1992 and before September 18, 2014.
(c)
The present value shall be determined without regard to the participant's sex based upon the interest rate and mortality assumptions determined as of the first day of the plan year that contains the participant's annuity starting date used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for single employer plan terminations.
(d)
(1)
If the plan is amended to change the time for determining the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation interest rate and mortality assumptions, then any lump sum settlement in the one-year period commencing at the time such amendment is effective (if the amendment is effective on or after the adoption date) shall be based on the interest rate and mortality assumptions determined under the plan, either before or after the amendment, which will result in the larger benefit. If such amendment is adopted retroactively (i.e., the amendment is effective prior to the adoption date), then the interest rate and mortality assumptions which will result in the larger benefit shall be used for any lump sum settlement made in the period beginning with the effective date of the amendment and ending one year after the amendment's adoption date.
(2)
In addition, in no event shall an amendment changing the method for determining a lump sum settlement (as a result of retirement, disability, or death) deprive a participant of his lump sum settlement so determined to the later of the effective date or adoption date of any such amendment. Should an amendment be adopted which directly or indirectly affects the computation of a participant's lump sum settlement, such participant's lump sum settlement so determined shall be equal to or greater than the lump sum settlement determined (without regard to such amendment) as of the later of the amendment's adoption date or effective date.
(3)
If a vested participant receives a lump sum settlement pursuant to this section 2 of article XIII, which is equal to the present value of his entire accrued benefit and subsequently resumes covered employment under the plan, he or she shall not have the right to restore his accrued benefit relating to such distribution.
(e)
Direct rollovers. This subsection XIII, 2(e) generally applies to distributions on or after January 1, 1993.
(1)
Rollover election. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection XIII, 2(e), a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2)
Definitions.
(i)
Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities).
(ii)
Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code, an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, and with respect to distributions after December 31, 2001, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, and for distributions after December 31, 2007 a Roth individual retirement plan described in section 408A of the Code, and any of which accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution, and, in the case of an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code. For distributions made after December 31, 2001, for purposes of the direct rollover provisions of XIII, 2(e) of the plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
(iii)
Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the Employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Effective for distributions made on or after January 1, 2010, a distributee includes a non-spouse beneficiary, provided the direct rollover is made by a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer and such direct rollover is made in accordance with section 402(c)(11)(A) of the Code, applicable regulations, and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
(iv)
Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
3.
Assigning, commuting or encumbering benefits prohibited; protection from attachment, garnishment or other processes. No person entitled to benefits under this plan shall have the right to assign, commute or encumber the benefits herein provided. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the benefits or payments herein provided shall not in any way be liable to attachment, garnishment or other process, or to be seized, taken, appropriated or applied by any legal or equitable process to pay any debt or liability of such person. The preceding also applies to the creation, assignment or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, unless such order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code or any domestic relations order entered before January 1, 1985. Upon receipt of a domestic relations order, the administrator shall, within a reasonable period of time, review the domestic relations order to determine whether it is a qualified domestic relations order. The administrator shall promptly notify the participant and the alternate payee(s) of the procedures for determining whether such order is qualified.

Sec. 1-14-14. - Article XIV—Permanent and total disability.
1.
A participant who terminates employment prior to his normal retirement date as a result of a disability and who is subsequently deemed to be permanently and totally disabled in accordance with the employer's current long-term disability program shall be entitled to additional credited service as specified in section 3 of article XIV.
2.
The administrator may require proof of continued disability. Such proof may be required from time to time but not more frequently than once every six months.
3.
Any participant who is disabled will continue to accrue credited service to the earlier of his or her normal retirement date, death or recovery.
4.
If the participant survives to his normal retirement date, the participant shall be vested and begin to receive his or her normal retirement benefit. The normal retirement benefit shall include the years of credited service stated in section 3 of article XIV above and the accrued benefit which would have been payable at his or her normal retirement date using his or her average monthly earnings as of the date of disability. The form of payment of the normal retirement benefit will be in accordance with and subject to the provisions and restrictions of article VI.
If the disability status ceases as a result of the participant's death, the participant's surviving spouse (if any) shall be entitled to receive a monthly survivor benefit in accordance with and subject to the provisions of section 4 of article VI.
