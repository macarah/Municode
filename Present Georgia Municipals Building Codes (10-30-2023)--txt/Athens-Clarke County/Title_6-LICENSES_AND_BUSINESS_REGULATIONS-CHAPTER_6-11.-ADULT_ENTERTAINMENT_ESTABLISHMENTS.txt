Sec. 6-11-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: Reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

(c)
In the event the chief of police shall suspend or revoke any adult entertainment establishment license hereunder, the suspension or revocation shall be for a period not less than one day nor more than 365 days, within the discretion of the chief of police. Provided, however, that the licensee shall be authorized to continue in business until that date of the hearing scheduled pursuant to section 1-5-1 of this Code. No applicant may apply for an adult entertainment establishment license during any period of suspension or revocation. In any hearing the administrative hearing officer shall consider, among other things, the severity of the allegations, the evidence submitted and the testimony presented, in making any decision on upholding, denying or modifying the suspension or revocation, and the duration of either.
