ARTICLE X. - COMPLAINTS, GREIVANCES AND APPEALS

Sec. 46-171. - Philosophy.
(a)
It is the responsibility of employees of the county to provide efficient and continuous service to the citizens of the county. The county recognizes that employee morale is an important factor in maintaining a high level of public service; and that the efficient and productive organization is measured in part by the employee's willingness to work cooperatively with other employees and with his/her supervisor.
(b)
The primary purpose of these rules shall be to determine what is right rather than who is right. Free discussion between an employee and supervisor will lead to a better understanding by both parties as to policies, practices, and procedures, which affect all employees. This will tend to identify and reduce conditions, which may cause misunderstanding and grievances.
(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-172. - Complaint.
(a)
A complaint is a statement of employee dissatisfaction about some action, exclusive of adverse actions, event or condition in the work environment, which is meaningful to the extent that the employee feels it is necessary to make it known to others.
(b)
Any complaint should be made verbally to the immediate supervisor. The complaint shall be dealt with informally. The reply will normally be verbal.
(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-173. - Grievance.
A grievance is a complaint that has not been resolved. A grievance is caused in most cases by the inability or unwillingness of individuals to adapt to one or more aspects of the work environment. The failure to adapt can be the fault of the employee or the supervisor or perhaps both. An awareness of the underlying cause of grievances and prompt resolution of these causes is mandatory for effective employee relations and efficient performance of an organization. A grievance procedure has been established to affect this purpose.

c.
Should a decision not be rendered within the prescribed time limits, the grievant may immediately appeal to the next step.

If a termination is for a stigmatizing reason(s) that the employee contends is false, the employee, including probationary employees, may request a name-clearing hearing before the appeal and grievance review board in order to present information intended to show that the reasons for termination are false. The information may be written or oral testimony of the employee and any witness presented by the employee, and may include documentary or other evidence. The purpose of such hearing is to permit the employee an opportunity to attempt to "clear his/her name" with respect to the allegedly false reason(s) for termination. As such, there is no requirement that information be presented to support the termination nor is the appeal and grievance review board required to take any action on the information presented.
