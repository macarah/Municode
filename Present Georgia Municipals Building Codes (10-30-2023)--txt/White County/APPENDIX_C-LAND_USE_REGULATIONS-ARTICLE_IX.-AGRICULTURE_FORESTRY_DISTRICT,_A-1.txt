ARTICLE IX. - AGRICULTURE FORESTRY DISTRICT, A-1
The White County Board of Commissioners recognize the tremendous value that our farming and agricultural communities have and will continue to be in the coming years. That is why it is duly noted that agricultural and farming properties are grandfathered in that as long as the property maintains its purpose as of the date of this document, the operation of it shall not be impeded by this appendix. Agricultural land may be subdivided for family estate purposes and shall continue to exist as such for the heirs of the property.

Section 900. - Purpose and intent.
Located in White County are several areas which contain soils highly suitable for the cultivation and operation of agricultural activities. These areas of prime agricultural lands are located in several communities throughout the county.
Land designated for the Agriculture Forestry Protection Land Use District constitutes a valuable natural resource whose protection is in the public interest. Agriculture is a major component of White County's economy, and it remains a viable economic enterprise in that land is held in relatively large tracts and land values are sufficiently low to support exclusively agricultural uses.
The White County Board of Commissioners realize that there are times where capital is required to continue operations related to agricultural purposes, therefore, the board authorizes the subdividing of said classified properties for the benefit of the farming operations. The purchaser of said subdivision may request that this property be reclassified if he or she wishes. The continuation of agriculture as a viable land use and component of the location economy is threatened by suburban and urban development land subdivision and land uses. When land is subdivided into smaller tracts, it becomes less suitable for agriculture because the assembly of enough acreage for a farm of minimum efficient size becomes difficult. Smaller tracts generally sell for a higher price per acre, and subdivision of large agricultural tracts generally results in the increase of per-acre land values. The availability of smaller tracts at lower costs attracts suburban and non-farm buyers into the market, thereby increasing adjacent land values for residential uses and decreasing land values for agricultural uses. The cumulative impact of the subdivision of farm land into small lots increases the level of conflict between farmers and non-farmers, makes farming more difficult, and eventually leads to dissolution of the agricultural economy.
Forestry has been an important industry for White County for many decades. In regards [to] complete removal of trees from a property, White County will encourage replanting of this renewable resource. We want to see continued green space so that we are not only good stewards of the lands entrusted to us but it also provides cleaner air and a healthier environment for us to raise our children.
Therefore, pursuant to the many goals, objectives, policies and recommendations of the comprehensive plan for White County, an Agriculture Forestry Land Use District is hereby established with the purposes of maintaining the agricultural land resources in a form amenable to the continuation of agriculture, restricting the division of farmland so that it does not become broken up into small parcels, thereby avoiding the accelerated conversion of land residential uses and discouraging the shift of the land market from rural to suburban/urban. An additional purpose of this land use district is [to] keep open enough land so that agriculture remains functionally viable, through the application of use restrictions which promote the preservation of prime agricultural lands. While the intent of this district is to promote maximum use of such areas for crop cultivation, the district regulations permit other active agricultural uses. Another purpose of this district is to hereby establish and promote the best use of forested land and to discourage and manage the division and development of forest land through use restrictions and various development requirements. This district may, in some very limited cases, serve as a transition from intensive agricultural operations to extremely low residential uses.
This district also includes a number of businesses and establishments uses that require a special use permit (SUP) from the White County Commission. Uses requiring special use permits are those that would not be appropriate without restrictions and is not permitted by right or conditionally, but allowed through regulations as to the number, area, location, relation to neighborhoods, operations or other pertinent considerations and specification/criteria as specified in this Code.
