For all regular full-time employees, a "paid time off day" is defined by this policy as the number of hours in length of one work day in an employee's assigned shift (i.e., eight hours, 8.5 hours, ten hours, 12 hours or 24 hours). An employee on paid time off will be compensated at their regular hourly rate times the number of "paid time off hours" actually taken.

(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-208. - Family leave policy.
(a)
Eligibility.
(1)
Employees who have worked for the county for at least twelve months and at least 1250 hours during the twelve months preceding the leave may take up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave (during a 12-month period) for the following reasons:
a.
Birth and/or care of a child of the employee;
b.
Placement of a child into the employee's family by adoption or by a foster care arrangement;
c.
In order to care for the employee's spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition;
d.
A serious health condition, which renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position.
(2)
The 12-month period shall be a "rolling" 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave will be used to determine the 12 weeks of eligibility.
(b)
In the case of unpaid leave for the birth or placement of a child, intermittent leave or working a reduced number of hours is not permitted unless both the employee and employer agree. Likewise, in such event, if the county employs both spouses, the combined leave shall not exceed 12 weeks. Leave for birth or placement of a child must conclude within 12 months of the birth or placement.
(c)
In the case of unpaid leave for serious health conditions, the leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced-hours basis only if such leave is medically necessary. If intermittent or reduced hours leave is required, the county may in its sole discretion temporarily transfer the employee to another job with equivalent pay and benefits.
(d)
During family leaves of absence, the county will continue to pay the health insurance premiums of the employee on the same bases of current county pay. If the employee does not return to work after the expiration of the leave, the employee will be required to reimburse the county for payment of health insurance premiums during the family leave, unless:
(1)
The employee does not return because of the presence of a serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing his/her job;
(2)
Circumstances beyond the control of the employee; or
(3)
The employee is a "key" employee hereinafter defined and the county denied job restoration to the employee.
(e)
To the extent allowed by law, employees are required to use their available vacation time and sick leave, if such leave is otherwise available to the employee in accordance with the sick leave policy, during the 12-week family leave.
(f)
During unpaid leave, the employee shall not accrue employment benefits, such as vacation pay, sick pay, leave accrual, pension, etc. Employment benefits accrued by the employee up to the day on which the family leave of absence begins will not be lost.
(g)
Employees who return to work from family leave of absence within or on the business day following the expiration of the 12 weeks are entitled to return to their job or an equivalent position without loss of benefits or pay.
(h)
The county may, under specified and limited circumstances, refuse to reinstate certain, high-paid "key" employees after using family leave. In order to do so, the county will:
(1)
Notify the employee of his/her status as "key" employee in response to the employee's notice of intent to take family leave.
(2)
Notify the employee as soon as the county decides to deny job restoration and explain the reasons for this decision.
(3)
Offer the employee a reasonable opportunity to return to work from family leave after giving this notice.
(i)
A "key" employee is a salaried "eligible" employee who has been designated by the county as "key." Normally, a "key" employee is among the highest paid ten percent of employees within 75 miles of the work site.
(j)
Applications for family leaves of absence must be submitted at least 30 days before the leave is to commence, or as soon as possible if 30 days notice is not possible. Appropriate forms should be submitted through the department manager to the county manager to initiate family leave and to return the employee to active status. Employees requesting family leave shall provide the county with appropriate medical certification.
(k)
Prior to return to active duty, a medical certificate of fitness for duty is required before being restored to employment.
(l)
The provisions of this family leave policy shall supersede any conflicting personnel policies when the requested leave qualifies as leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
(m)
Military family leave entitlements.
(1)
Eligible employees with a spouse, son, daughter, or parent on active duty or call to active duty status in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post- deployment reintegration briefings.
(2)
FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a covered service member during a single 12-month period. A covered service member is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who has a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render the service member medically unfit to perform his or her duties for which the service member is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; or is in outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired list.

Sec. 46-209. - Leave to donate blood.
(a)
In accordance with Georgia Law (Acts 1976 pp 165, 166), each employee shall be allowed a leave of absence with pay for purposes of donating blood.
(b)
The leave will not be more than eight hours in each calendar year. This absence shall be computed at two hours per donation, up to four times per year.
(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-210. - Re-employment.
In those instances where the nature or length of a leave, with the exception of military service and leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, dictates that the county fills the employee's position on a permanent basis, the county reserves the right to refuse reemployment to the displaced employee to the extent allowed by law.
(Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04)
Sec. 46-211. - Bridging years of service.
Any full-time employee, who terminates employment with the county and subsequently returns in a full-time capacity, may be allowed to "bridge" back to the original employment period.
(1)
For retirement purposes: The following is descriptive only as an employee's right to retirement benefits, including the amount thereof, shall be governed by the applicable plan documents and shall not be in any way modified, supplemented, or enhanced by the following:
a.
When an employee has been covered by the county's retirement plan during a period of employment, which measures five years, or longer, he/she shall retain a non-forfeitable right to his/her monthly accrued benefit (retirement pay) determined as of his date of termination of employment. However, should the employee elect, the employee may receive all participant contributions (plus interest) at the time of employment termination. When this occurs, and the employee subsequently returns to full-time employment, "bridging" back to the original employment period is not allowed. Conversely, if the employee elects to leave his/her contributions in the retirement plan at the time of termination of service, but subsequently returns to full-time employment, full credit will be given for the prior period in which participant contributions were made.
(2)
For leave purposes: Bridging is not allowed back to the original employment date, but the anniversary date will be adjusted to give credit for prior service.

Sec. 46-214. - Employee assistance program policy.
(a)
Purpose. To assist all county employees at a time when issues of a personal nature may interfere with their effective functioning as members of a competent staff, with a goal of improving or maintaining their job performance and retaining them as valued members of the county staff.
(b)
Policy.
(1)
It is the policy of the county to offer all employees the use of an employee assistance program to provide confidential assessment and referral service for serious personal problems. An independent organization will be selected to provide these services.
(2)
The county recognizes that a number of personal/medical problems including, but not limited to: stress, legal, financial, alcoholism, marital and family concerns, drug dependence, emotional problems, etc., are treatable disorders and can improve with proper professional assistance.
(3)
The benefits of the employee assistance program shall be available to all employees of the county and their dependents who seek assessment and referral for personal or medical problems.
(4)
The services of the employee assistance program will be provided to employees at no cost. However, when referrals are made to resources outside of the employee assistance program, the employee will be responsible for the costs.
(5)
All records of the employee assistance program shall be strictly confidential unless the employee chooses to sign a release. The purpose of this aspect of the policy is to encourage employees and their families to seek referral to treatment without embarrassment.
(c)
Supervisory referrals.
(1)
The county recognizes that supervisory personnel are not trained to be diagnosticians of personal or medical problems, yet they may be the first to notice a deterioration of job performance, which may indicate such problems. Therefore, supervisory referrals to the employee assistance program must be based strictly on documented deteriorating job performance.
(2)
Such referrals for assessment for failure in performance of duties will be considered mandatory. Failure to comply with a mandatory referral will be addressed under the guidelines of the county's disciplinary policy.
(3)
No employee shall have his or her job placed in jeopardy because of a request for assistance for a personal/medical problem. However, employees referred to the employee assistance program will be fully responsible for cooperating and participating in the program.
(4)
Although the employee is expected to follow through on the recommendations of the employee assistance counselor, job performance remains the ultimate criteria for assessment. Continuing job performance decline will be handled according to normal disciplinary procedures.
(5)
To ensure the successful implementation of this program, employee feedback is encouraged in order to adapt the program, if necessary, to better meet the needs of all county employees.
(6)
This policy does not alter or replace existing administrative policy, but serves to assist in its utilization.
(d)
Time off. If an employee requests time off from work to seek assistance, the employee will be granted time off in the following order:
(1)
Compensatory time;
(2)
Paid time off (PTO);
(3)
Time off without pay.
(e)
Voluntary disclosure of drug and/or alcohol abuse. Employees of the county shall be entitled to up to 30 consecutive calendar days for initial substance abuse treatment as follows:
(1)
The employee shall be required to use all paid time off (PTO) and compensatory time available;
(2)
In the event accumulated paid time off (PTO) and compensatory time is insufficient to provide the medically prescribed and needed treatment, up to a maximum of 30 consecutive calendar days, the employee will be provided paid leave for the difference up to the maximum 30-day treatment period.
