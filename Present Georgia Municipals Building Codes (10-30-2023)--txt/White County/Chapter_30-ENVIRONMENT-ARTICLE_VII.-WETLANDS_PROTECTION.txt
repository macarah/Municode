ARTICLE VII. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 30-181. - Title.
This article shall be known as the "Wetlands Protection Resolution of White County."
(Res. No. 2004-27, ยง I, 7-6-04)
Sec. 30-182. - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the county planning commission.
(b)
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit, as hereby described, will be required prior to any activity. No local permits or permission will be granted for a proposed development project that appears to contain wetlands or be located near wetlands so as to potentially alter them until the Corps of Engineers has determined whether jurisdictional wetlands exist on the site. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Res. No. 2004-27, ยง II, 7-6-04)
Sec. 30-183. - Permitting.
(a)
Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission or permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the county planning director or their designee, using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the Corps determines wetland are present, on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or a letter of permission is issued
(b)
Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other resolution or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein.
(1)
Operations conducted during normal forestry activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices provided they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(3)

(4)
Forestry practicing applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

d.
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses, or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.

(1)
A map of all planned land disturbance activity shall bear the signature/seal of a registered or certified professional in engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, land surveying, or erosion and sedimentation control or a county surveyor, and shall conform to current guidelines as set forth in the Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinances of 1975 as amended.

(5)
Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials.
(6)
All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology.
(e)
Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a permit fee specified by the county or its designee.
