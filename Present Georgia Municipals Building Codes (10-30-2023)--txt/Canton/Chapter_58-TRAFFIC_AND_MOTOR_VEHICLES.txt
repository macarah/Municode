(Ord. No. 2020-0917-02 , 9-17-2020)
Sec. 58-131. - Findings.
The Canton City Council finds that residents of certain neighborhoods and certain public streets located within the city limits of Canton desire that personal transportation vehicles be allowed to be driven with regular vehicle traffic. The Canton City Council, by adoption of this article, shall allow the use of personal transportation vehicles within the parameters of state law, but the Canton City Council expresses no opinion as to whether the mixture of regular vehicle traffic and personal transportation vehicles upon the public streets and rights-of-way are safe. Given the safety concerns of Canton City Council, the Canton City Council will approve a personal transportation vehicle district only upon receiving a request for such personal transportation vehicle use via the procedure set forth hereto and subject to the Canton City Council's discretion to approve such personal transportation vehicle district by a finding that it meets the criteria of this article. The Canton City Council, on behalf of itself, agents, employees and representatives of the city, do not waive any right of sovereign immunity or individual qualified immunity. The Canton City Council places all citizens and guests on public notice that all drivers or occupants of motorized vehicles, given the disproportionate size of personal transportation vehicles in comparison to regular vehicular traffic, do knowingly and voluntarily assume all risks of property damage, injury or death in regard to the operation of any personal transportation vehicle. All liability for injury shall be the responsibility of the party causing such injury but in no way shall Canton or any of its employees be liable for any action or inaction concerning personal transportation vehicles authorized pursuant to the article.
