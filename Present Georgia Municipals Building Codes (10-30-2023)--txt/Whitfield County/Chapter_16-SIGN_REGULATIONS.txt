Remedies—Injunctive relief. When any structure or accessory structure which is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained; or any structure, accessory structure, land use, or land condition violates any portion of this chapter, the zoning administrator or his or her designee may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any similar remedy which adjacent or neighboring property holders may already have pursuant to the laws of Georgia and shall have no effect thereon.

Conflict with other laws. Whenever the regulations of this chapter require a greater width or size of yards, building, or smaller number of stories, or require a greater percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other more restrictive standards than are required in or pursuant to any other statute, law, rule, or regulation, the requirements of this chapter shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other statute require more restrictive standards than are required by this chapter, the provisions of such statute shall govern.
(10)
Separability. Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
