State Law reference— Ethics, O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1 et seq.

Sec. 2-71. - Purpose/declaration of policy.
(a)
The proper operation of democratic government requires that the public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; the government decisions and policy be made through proper channels of the governmental structure; public office not be used for personal gain; the public officials and employees be free from the appearance of impropriety; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all county officials and employees is adopted. The purpose of this policy is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the county and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private, financial or other interests in matters affecting the county.
(b)
The board of commissioners of the county believes that public service is a public trust. Maintaining that public trust requires the county to protect against improper influence or the appearance of improper influence. The purpose should be to ensure that public officials will be impartial and use independent judgment in carrying out their duties. To help ensure this quality, the board of commissioners finds and declares the need to establish appropriate ethical standards for conduct.
(c)
The board of commissioners of the county does not intend that this article impede the desire for those who want to seek and serve in public office. To this end, public officials should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens. Public service should not restrict the ability to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests. Only in those cases in which a conflict of the public's trust and interest would result should a restriction be applied.
(d)
This ethics code follows the precedent of earlier federal, state and local codes. It makes clear those standards of ethical conduct that will apply to public officials in the discharge of their official duties; implements the objective of protecting the integrity of the government; and prescribes only such essential restrictions against conflicts of interest so as not to impose unnecessary barriers against public service.

Never discriminate by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether or not for remuneration;

Expose corruption wherever discovered;
(6)
Never solicit, accept, or agree to accept gifts, loans, gratuities, discounts, favors, hospitality, or services from any person, association, or corporation for himself/herself, or any member of his/her immediate family, under circumstances from which it could reasonably be inferred that a major purpose of the donor is to influence the performance of the official's/employee's official duties. For gifts, loans, gratuities, discounts, favors, hospitality, or services solicited, accepted, or agreed to accept under circumstances from which it cannot be reasonably inferred that a major purpose of the donor was to influence the performance of the official/employee's official duties the following rules shall apply: A covered official shall publicly disclose, prior to discussing or taking any official action on any matter involving the donor, any gift or campaign contribution (cash or in kind) received by him/her, or any member of his/her immediate family, greater than $100.00.

(7)
Never accept any economic opportunity for himself/herself, or any member of his/her immediate family, under circumstances where he/she knows or should know that there is a substantial possibility that the opportunity is being afforded with intent to influence his/her conduct in the performance of his/her official duties.

(8)
Never engage in other conduct which is unbecoming to an official/employee or which constitutes a breach of public trust.

(e)
Incapable service. No county official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render service for any private entity, unless approved in writing by such employee's or official's department head or superior.

(f)
Appearance. No county official or employee shall appear on behalf of any private person other than himself, his spouse or minor children, before any county agency, authority or board. However, a member of the board of commissioners may appear before such groups on behalf of his constituents in the course of his duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations.

(m)
Organizational integrity. County commissioners, as policy makers, shall refrain from unduly interfering in the daily administrative affairs of department supervisors.

Procedure.

The complaint shall be filed with the county clerk no later than 45 days after the alleged act occurred unless the complainant, by exercising due diligence, failed to discover the alleged violation of the Code of Ethics within such 45-day period. In such case, a complainant must file the complaint no later than 45 days after the complainant discovered the alleged violation.
(b)
In no event shall an ethics complaint be filed more than six months from the date of the alleged violation hereof.

In the event the complaint regards the county manager, the county clerk and the county attorney, it shall be filed with the commission chairman.

Upon receipt of a complaint, the commission chairman shall appoint two members of the commission (one of which may be the chairman), who, along with the county attorney (unless the complaint is against the county attorney, in which case the commission chair may request the assistant of another county attorney in adjacent circuits), shall constitute an investigating committee to determine whether the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances so as to warrant a public hearing. This initial determination is whether the complaint is on its face unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or failed to state facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction. A majority of the review panel must agree that a sufficient basis has been given to warrant a public hearing.
(f)
Certain violations alleged against county officials who are employees may be referred through the proper channels consistent with the employee handbook's disciplinary procedures.
(g)
In the event the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to constitute an alleged violation and is found unjustified, frivolous or patently unfounded, it shall be dismissed and the complainant notified immediately. In the event the complaint is found to state sufficient facts to warrant a hearing before the review panel, the board shall be appointed as provided herein.
(h)
If a complaint is received by the county clerk which alleges a violation of the code of ethics by a member of the board of commissioners:
(1)
A determination of sufficiency of the complaint will not be forwarded to the board of commissioners.
(2)
The county attorney of any county within the mountain judicial circuit or any circuit abutting the mountain judicial circuit other than the county attorney for Habersham County, shall make the determination of whether or not a review board should be impaneled.
(3)
The complaint shall be served on the member of the governing authority charged as soon as practicable after the determination in subsection (h)(2) above. Service may be by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(4)
If a review board is needed, three county attorneys, other than the county attorney for Habersham County, shall be selected by the county attorney (subject to approval by the board of commissioners) within reasonably close geographic proximity of the county will be requested to conduct a public hearing based upon the complaint within 60 days of the impaneling of the review board. If the complaint is against the county attorney, then the chairman may appoint a replacement.
(5)
The review board shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the procedures and regulations it establishes but, in all circumstances, the hearing shall include the taking of testimony and the cross examination of witnesses. The member of the governing authority who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses and to present evidence and witnesses in opposition or in extenuation.
(6)
A majority vote based upon clear and convincing evidence will determine the existence of the violation or lack thereof.
(7)
Should the review board find a violation has occurred, the review board will assess the commensurate penalty for the violation. A written decision shall be issued to the Habersham County Board of Commissioners within 15 days of the conclusion of the public hearing for enforcement of disciplinary action pursuant to section 2-80.
(8)
The board of commissioners, at a public hearing within 30 days of the rendering of the review board's findings and determination, may by majority vote, decide that no action is to be taken or may decide to take any action consistent with state law and the provisions set forth hereinafter regarding disciplinary action. In the event that a member of the board of commissioners is a party under investigation, such commissioner shall not participate in any such decision.
(i)
Appeals.

Sec. 2-124. - Purpose.
The purpose of these purchasing policies and procedures is to provide guidance for the procurement of goods and services in compliance with procurement provisions of Habersham County ("county") and the State of Georgia. The goal of this policy is to establish, foster, and maintain the following principles:
• To consider the best interests of Habersham County in all transactions;
• To purchase without prejudice, seeking to obtain the maximum value for each dollar expenditure with maximum quality standards; and
• To subscribe to and work for honesty and truth in buying.
The adoption of this purchasing manual and the approval of any subsequent revisions to it by the Board of County Commissioners of Habersham County, Georgia, shall authorize the policies and procedures contained herein for official use of county business.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-125. - Scope.
The scope of this manual and the policies and procedures contained herein governs all departments under the jurisdiction of the board of county commissioners, as well as all purchasing transactions which are paid for directly from County funds under the control of the board of county commissioners. This manual and the policies and procedures contained herein pre-empts all previously existing purchasing manuals, policies, and procedures.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )

The board of county commissioners and the purchasing officers are the only individuals processing legally-binding purchasing authority.

Sec. 2-127. - Purchases by a purchasing card.
The purchasing card (P-Card) is a credit card issued by SunTrust Bank. It is a fast and flexible purchasing tool that provides an extremely efficient and effective method of purchasing and paying for items within the following parameters:
The purchasing card enables cardholders to purchase non-restricted commodities directly from suppliers. Approved purchases can be completed with suppliers over the phone, in person, or over the internet.
The purchasing card will be issued in the employee's name with "Habersham County" clearly indicated on the card. The purchasing card program provides a cost-efficient method for purchasing goods and services. Built-in card features make the program easy to control and reduces processing costs at all levels by minimizing the number of invoices and checks. Responsibilities, thresholds, and requirements detailed in these policies and procedures apply to purchases by purchase card but may follow different practices and processes due to their electronic nature.
Employees and/or elected officials issued purchasing cards will sign a purchasing cardholder agreement prior to being issued a purchasing card. Purchasing cards are requested by department directors through a purchasing card request form. The purchasing card request form establishes a line limit for the cardholder. The following elected officials are authorized to use a card:
• Clerk of court

• Coroner
• Magistrate judge
• Sheriff

Sec. 2-128. - Purchases requiring a bid.
Each purchase or service that is estimated to cost over $20,000.00 requires formal advertising, sealed bids, and shall be awarded by the board of commissioners.

A department director or elected official submits a written description of items or services for bid to the finance department.
b.
Finance department creates a request for proposal or request for qualifications. This should consist of, but is not limited to:

(2)
Bid process. Sealed bids will be received at any time during regular business hours prior to the specific date and time advertised.

(3)
Bid award. The board of commissioners will receive a recommendation from the county manager and award the bid to the lowest, responsive, and responsible bidder during its regular board meeting.

When only one bid is presented, the same rules apply as to acceptance and rejection. Thus, if the single bid applies with all the material specifications the county may award the single bidder the contract as the lowest, responsive, and responsible bid. Conversely, the county states on all bids that it has the right to reject any and all bids. Therefore, the county has the privilege to reject a single bid that is found unacceptable. Should there be a decision to set a new bid date, the single bid should be returned to the vendor unopened with a letter explaining the entire transaction.
b.
The Board of Commissioners of Habersham County, reserves the right to show preference to local bidders in the purchase of supplies, equipment, and services. The amount shall not exceed five percent of the amount bid or quoted and/or $50,000.00 whichever is less. A "local" bidder is defined as an individual or business that maintains a place of business or maintains an inventory of merchandise and/or equipment in Habersham County; is licensed by Habersham County and/or the State of Georgia, if required, and is subject to Habersham County real and/or personal property taxes. Notice of preference availability shall be included in the invitation to bid and in all advertisements. Note: State law prohibits local preference for public works or road project bids.
c.
Consideration will be given to the original company's expertise regarding bids on improvements, work to existing equipment, or projects that are proprietary in nature.
d.
When the board of commissioners does not select the lowest bidder, the finance department shall document the reason(s) why the low bid was not awarded. If there is a bid protest by a bidder, they must file a written protest within three days after the bid has been awarded. The protesting bidder will need to send a certified signed letter explaining his/her protest to the finance department.
(4)

f.
Purchase of supplies and equipment required for parts or components being procured as replacement parts in support of equipment specially designed by a manufacturer, where data available is not adequate to assure that the part of component is identical with the part it is to replace or where contemplated procurement is to match or complement equipment or components previously purchased.
g.
Purchase of technical, non-personal services in connection with the assembly, installation, or servicing (or the instruction of personnel therein) of a highly technical or specialized nature.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-129. - Recurring purchases.
To be considered recurring, an expense must be a routine expense defined monthly or quarterly. Examples of recurring expenses are: utility bills, facility cleaning bills, landscaping bills, telephone bills, internet usage fees, postage meter rental fees, copier maintenance fees, and facility rent. Recurring expenses do not require a purchase order process except when they are a contracted service. For contracted services a check request form or purchase order should be completed for the typical cycle (e.g. one year or a contract period). The same approval, quote, and document requirements apply based on annual estimated threshold amounts.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-130. - Emergency purchases.
Emergency purchases are authorized when there is an immediate need for items or services to deal with an emergency situation. Emergencies are defined as existing conditions which pose a threat to the safety, health, or welfare of the citizens of Habersham County.
If the emergency occurs during normal working hours, the department director must attempt to obtain appropriate authorization for the purchase through verbal communications as defined in Section 1 of the Purchasing Policies & Procedures and submitting required documentation based on estimated threshold within 24 hours. The documentation shall make note of the reason for emergency.
In an emergency situation the county manager may authorize an emergency purchase and waive any bid requirements as these requirements would cause undue delay in the delivery of essential services under such conditions.
If the emergency occurs at night, on weekends, or on holidays, the department director may initiate independent action after attempting to contact the county manager if the estimated threshold exceeds their authority.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-131. - Business travel expenses.
Habersham County will reimburse employees for reasonable business travel expenses incurred while on assignments away from the normal work location. All business travel must be approved in advance by the department director and comply with established policies.
Employees whose travel expenses have been approved are responsible for making their own travel arrangements.
When approved, the costs of travel, meals, lodging and other expenses directly related to accomplishing business travel objectives will be reimbursed by Habersham County up to the limits stated in the official county travel policy. Employees are expected to limit expenses to reasonable amounts. Travel expenses paid for utilizing Habersham County's P-Card system will follow the same procedures as illustrated in Section 2: Purchases by a Purchasing Card. Furthermore, receipts for meals should be itemized so it is clearly identifiable what food and/or drink was purchased. Failure to provide an itemized receipt may prohibit reimbursements and/or initiate disciplinary action as outlined in Section 2: Purchases by a Purchasing Card.
Employees who are involved in an accident while traveling on business must promptly report the incident to their immediate supervisor. Vehicles owned, leased, or rented by Habersham County may not be used for personal use without prior approval.
When travel is completed, employees should submit completed travel expense reports within five days. Reports should be accompanied by receipts for all individual expenses in accordance with the established county policy.
Employees should contact their supervisor for guidance and assistance on procedures related to travel arrangements, travel advances, expense reports, reimbursement for specific expenses or any other business travel issues. Abuse of this business travel expenses policy, including falsifying expense reports to reflect costs not incurred by the employee, can be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

1.
Payment for lodging is authorized when the individual's travel requires overnight accommodations. Receipts are required for all lodging costs.
2.
Employees and officials may request direct payment or be reimbursed for the cost of single standard room accommodations typically occupied by business travelers at moderately-priced hotels.

b.
Meals. Employees, elected officials, and other authorized personnel are entitled to reimbursement for meals based on the IRS Federal Guidelines as set according to the IRS Standards which can be found at the following link: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104877.
1.
Day of departure — Employees may only receive per diem for meals occurring while officially on travel status. For example,
a.
If an employee departs at 3:00 p.m., the employee is not eligible for breakfast or lunch per diem amounts for the day of departure.
b.
If an employee departs on an overnight trip prior to 6:30 a.m. the employee is eligible for per diem for breakfast on the day of departure.
c.
If an employee departs on an overnight trip prior to 11:00 a.m., the employee is eligible for per diem for lunch on the day of departure.
d.
If an employee departs on an overnight trip prior to 5:30 p.m., the employee is eligible for per diem for dinner on the day of departure.

Modes of travel. The mode of transportation used should be the most reasonable, convenient, and economical available.
1.
Air.
a.
It is the obligation of each employee and official to choose the least expensive flight from alternatives. In many cases, a traveling employee can save hundreds of dollars by purchasing tickets on discount airlines, utilizing promotional flights that may require advance booking, or by booking flights that may entail an extra stop, or may depart or arrive at times slightly less convenient. The savings available on these flights frequently outweigh the traveler's inconvenience, even when they necessitate travel schedule adjustments.
In this era of low priced airfare electronic ticket purchasing, ticket exchanges, cancellations, or credit for unused tickets have become more difficult to obtain. Therefore, the traveling employee must be certain of their travel needs before booking.
b.
The approved class of transportation for all employees is coach/tourist. Most major airlines offer discounted fares under certain conditions. Every effort should be made to take advantage of these discounted rates by planning and ordering tickets within required time frames.
c.
If a business trip is canceled prior to departure, immediately begin the process of refunding the unused tickets.
2.
County vehicles. When using county vehicles, carpooling is strongly encouraged. Most county vehicles available will accommodate four individuals comfortably. Utilize a second county Vehicle or a personal vehicle if there are more than four traveling employees.
3.
Personal vehicles. Prior approval from the finance director or county manager must be obtained before reimbursement is granted to a county employee. Elected officials and/or staff working under their direction are exempt from obtaining approval prior to reimbursement.
a.
The reimbursement rate for personal mileage is equal to the rate published by the Internal Revenue Service (see IRS website for current rate at www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates) and authorized by the county manager. This rate is intended to cover fuel, maintenance, liability, and physical damage insurance cost of the personal vehicle.
b.
Requested mileage payment must be supported by the anticipated route obtained from a reputable internet map/direction system, which gives the anticipated mileage traveled (i.e. MapQuest). The county will pay the shorter of the mileage distance from the employee's office or the employee's home. Part-time employees, full-time employees, and elected officials are entitled to mileage reimbursement providing travel is part of official county business.
c.
An employee who receives a vehicle allowance is permitted to use a county vehicle or personal vehicle to travel outside the county provided such travel is official county business or training. If such travel is outside the normal scope of day-to-day use of said vehicle, mileage reimbursement may be obtained as outlined above in paragraph "B".
4.
Local ground transportation.
a.
Local transportation costs incurred while on out-of-town business will be paid.
b.
Receipts for the above services should be obtained, when possible, and provided to support payment.
d.
Registration.

Registration fees for conferences or seminars are paid when supported by receipts and proper approvals.
2.
Whenever possible, advance registration should be used. Registration should be made in a timely fashion in order to take advantage of early registration discounts available.
e.
Miscellaneous.

Some officials and members of management are required to meet with persons of other governmental jurisdictions and professional institutions from which an exchange of information can be obtained that will prove beneficial to the county. When, in the opinion of the official or manager, there has been such an exchange, they may deem it appropriate to pay for the meal. A vendor may be allowed to pay if it is in compliance with the county's Code of Ethics.
b.
Such meals may be reimbursed pursuant to the following stipulations:
a.
The requesting party is the county manager, or a department director, or it is a part of a professional learning opportunity (ex. a Lunch and Learn).

( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-132. - Conflict of interest.
Habersham County expects employees to avoid situations that cause a conflict of interest between their private interests and the business interests of Habersham County. Employees should also be sure that their private and business activities would be perceived as proper and free of conflicting interests. Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes only the framework within which Habersham County wishes to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction so that employees can seek further clarification on issues related to the subject of acceptable standards of operation. Contact the human resources department for more information or questions about conflicts of interest.
Transactions with outside firms must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the executive level of Habersham County. Business dealings with outside firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms. Unusual gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, gifts, loans, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks, and other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit the employer, the employee, or both.
An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of Habersham County's business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person as defined in the nepotism/hiring of relatives policy.
No "presumption of guilt" is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms. However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to the county manager as soon as possible the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.
Personal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which Habersham County does business but also when an employee or relative receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving Habersham County.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-133. - Equal opportunity.
Habersham County will provide an equal opportunity for all businesses to participate in county contracts regardless of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status. The county will actively seek to ensure that minority-owned and operated firms have the opportunity to participate in the purchasing process, including binding, negotiations, and contract awards. The county will not knowingly conduct business with contractors that discriminate or permit discrimination against persons because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, political affiliation, age, handicapped status, sexual orientation, sexual preference, or transgender status.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-134. - Ineligible vendors.
Any person, firm, or corporation in arrears to Habersham County for taxes, or otherwise, will not be qualified to bid on any purchase until their lien to the county has been cleared. No requisition will be approved for such vendors.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-135. - Gifts and gratuities.
An employee of the county may not accept personal gifts or favors of value or elaborate entertainment from any person or firm with whom the county is presently doing or has previously done business or from anyone desiring to establish business relations with the county.
Normal courtesies or items distributed as part of an advertising program may be accepted when there is obviously no intent to obtain special consideration for the donor. Return of gifts, gratuities, or refusal to accept them, should be done promptly and tactfully.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-136 - Violations.
Any elected official, agent, or employee of the county or person doing business with the county who knowingly violates the provisions of this article shall be personally liable for any losses incurred by the county.
Any elected official or employee who violates the provision of this article shall be subject to discharge or removal from office for cause or such lesser disciplinary action as may be appropriate in accordance with the county's personnel policies and procedures.
( Ord. of 12-14-2015, § 1 )
Sec. 2-137. - Penalties.
Any person found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $1,000.00 or be imprisoned in the county jail for a period not exceeding six months, or both fined and imprisoned.
