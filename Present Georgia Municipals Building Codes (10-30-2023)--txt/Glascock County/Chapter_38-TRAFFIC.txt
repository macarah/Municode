(14)
The applicant has not complied or cannot comply with applicable licensure requirements, ordinances or regulations concerning the sale or offering for sale of any goods or services;
(15)
The use or activity intended by the applicant is prohibited by law;

Nothing in this section shall authorize the permit official to deny or revoke a permit based upon political, social, or religious grounds or reasons, or based upon the content of the views expressed.
(d)
Costs and fees. The applicant shall be responsible for hiring and paying off-duty law enforcement officers, or reimbursing the county for the costs of providing on-duty law enforcement officers and/or county staff to appropriately police street closures. For festivals, the applicant shall be additionally responsible for hiring and paying off-duty law enforcement officers and fire/EMS personnel, or reimbursing the county for the costs of providing on-duty law enforcement officers and fire/EMS personnel, to provide internal festival safety and security.
The permit official, in consultation with the Glascock County Sheriff and fire departments, shall determine the number of officers and fire/EMS personnel needed to appropriately police street closures and for internal safety and security, and the time when such services shall commence and end, taking into consideration the following:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the county may provide the services required by this subsection at no cost, or at a reduced cost, to the applicant should the county desire to provide such support to the public assembly or parade. Such action is not a waiver of a regulatory requirement based upon political, social, or religious grounds or reasons, or based upon the content of the views expressed, but instead is an affirmative act of county association or speech.
(e)
Time and notice of decision. The permit official shall approve or deny an application within seven days of receipt. If the permit official fails to render a decision within seven calendar days of receipt, any required permit is waived. A notice of denial or revocation shall clearly set forth in writing the grounds upon which the permit was denied or revoked and, where feasible, shall contain a proposal for measures by which the applicant may cure any defects in the application or otherwise procure a permit. Where an application is denied because the proposed event would conflict with another event that has or will be approved, the permit official shall propose an alternative place, if available for the same time, or an alternative time, if available for the same place.
(f)
Appeals.
(1)
An applicant may appeal the denial or revocation of an application in writing within five days after notice of the denial has been received. Within five business days, or such longer period of time agreed to by the applicant, the appeals official shall hold a quasi-judicial hearing on whether to issue the permit or uphold the denial or revocation. The applicant shall have the right to present evidence at said hearing. The decision to issue or uphold the denial or revocation shall be based solely on the approval criteria set forth in this section. The appeals official shall render a decision on the appeal within five business days after the date of the hearing. In the event that the purpose of the proposed event is a spontaneous response to a current event, or where other good and compelling causes are shown, the appeals official shall reasonably attempt to conduct the hearing and render a decision on the appeal as expeditiously as is practicable.
(2)
The decision of the appeals official is subject to review in the Superior Court of Glascock County by proceedings in the nature of certiorari. Any petition for writ of certiorari for review shall be filed with the clerk of superior court within 30 days after the applicant has received notice of the decision. Unless good cause exists to contest a petition for writ of certiorari, the county shall stipulate to certiorari no later than five business days after the petitioner requests such a stipulation. The county shall transmit the record to the court no later than five business days after receiving the order allowing certiorari.
