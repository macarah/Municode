Sec. 18-76. - Moving permit for existing manufactured homes.
(a)
No existing manufactured home in the county may be moved or relocated in any manner whatsoever within the confines of the county without first obtaining a moving permit.
(b)
Before any manufactured home is moved from any location within the county, application must be made for a moving permit, which shall be issued only if the home meets the minimum standards and is approved by one of the following methods:
(1)
Manufactured homes to be relocated within the county shall be inspected by the county's designated building inspector, or the building inspector's designee, and found to meet the minimum standards. A re-inspection fee will be required for any subsequent inspection.
(2)
Applicants requesting a permit for a manufactured home not located within the county must provide the county's designated building inspector, or the building inspector's designee, with a signed affidavit of condition and photographs that clearly show that minimum standards are met, and post a $1,000.00 refundable "guarantee of condition" bond prior to the issuing of a permit. Once the manufactured home has been brought into the county, an inspection at the time of the installation inspection will be done to ensure the manufactured home meets these standards. If the manufactured home does not meet these standards according to the county's designated building inspector, or the building inspector's designee, power will not be approved until the standards have been met. The "guarantee of condition" bond will be forfeited if these standards are not met within 90 days.
(c)
If the manufactured home is being moved from one location to another and is not to be used as a residence or office, or is not being used for storage, then the manufactured home may not be moved without a variance being obtained from the board of commissioners first. An example of when a variance might be granted is if a manufactured home is being temporarily relocated and will be moved out of the county; or if a manufactured home is being moved for repair and improvements to be either moved out of the county or set up within the county once rehabilitated. A permit may be granted at the sole discretion of the commissioners.
(d)
The commissioners may attach any condition to a variance, including, but not limited to, a time within which certain things must be accomplished or any other condition the commissioners deem appropriate regarding the relocation, repair, and movement of such manufactured home.
