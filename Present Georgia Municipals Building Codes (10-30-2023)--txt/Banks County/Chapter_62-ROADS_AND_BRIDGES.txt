Sec. 62-31. - Purpose and findings.
Timber harvesting operations occur in the unincorporated portions of the county on a recurring basis; and
Timber harvesting is an important component of the local economy in the county, providing revenue to landowners, business opportunities, and jobs for local residents; it is the intent of the governing authority of the county to facilitate this industry while at the same time protecting county infrastructure and the safety of the community; and
Timber harvesting in many instances requires the use of county-maintained roads in order to transport the product to market; and
It is in the public interest to protect the county road system from damage caused by timber harvesting operations to the extent allowed by state law; and
O.C.G.A. § 12-6-24 authorizes and establishes the terms and conditions under which this article may be adopted and enforced; and
It is the intent of the governing authority of the county to preserve and exercise where appropriate all powers and authority granted to it under state law, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 32-4-42 and O.C.G.A. § 40-6-371, that are not in conflict with O.C.G.A. § 12-6-24, in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community.
It is hereby ordained by the governing authority of the county as set out in this article.
