ARTICLE VI. - ARR, AGRICULTURAL-RURAL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Section 601. - Purpose and intent.
The ARR, agricultural-rural residential district is established to preserve and maintain a compatible land use relationship in the rural environs of unincorporated Banks County, free from uses that have intensive agricultural, commercial, industrial or other nuisance characteristics. No tract of land can be less than two acres (except lots of record) in ARR. In order for a parcel or tract of land to be considered for rezoning to ARR, the parcel or tract of land must consist of at least two acres. No tract of land in ARR can be subdivided into tracts of less than two acres.
The siting of private landfills in this district is inconsistent with the intent of this district.
