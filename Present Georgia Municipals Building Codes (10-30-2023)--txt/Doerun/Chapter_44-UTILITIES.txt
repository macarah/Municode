(1)
Underground secondary service.
a.
Low voltage secondary service is where underground service is provided from transformers at or near the customer's property line.
b.
The city will provide up to 100 feet of conductor and conduit to the service. All required materials in excess of 100 feet will be paid for the by the customer at the actual cost to the city.

High voltage primary service requires a padmount transformer to be located on the customer's property near the service entrance. This service is not generally available for residential and small commercial customers.
b.
The city will provide all material for primary service up to 100 feet of the transformer. All required materials in excess of 100 feet will be paid for by the customer at the actual cost to the city. Property easements for the primary conductor must be granted by the customer.
c.
The customer is responsible for the construction of the transformer pad and the secondary conductor to the point of service.
(3)
Existing service. When requested, an existing overhead service may be changed to underground service. All cost for materials and labor will be paid by the customer. In general, the customer will be responsible for the installation of the conductor and conduit. City crews would make the final electrical connections.
(4)
Underground primary distribution. High voltage primary distribution serving residential and commercial areas must be approved by the city council.
(5)
Vault transformers (submergible). Vault transformers are currently used in only a few specific residential areas. Because of cost and maintenance concerns, no new installations of vault transformers will be made. Existing installations of vault transformers will be maintained.
(6)
Underground security lighting. Where security lighting is requested in an area which has underground service, it will be the responsibility of the customer to install the underground conductor from the transformer to the security light location. City crews will make all final electrical connections.

Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter and no properly located Y is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, which entry shall be in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection, only when approved by the superintendent.

All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in subsections (c), (e) and (f) of this section shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition, at the time of analysis, of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, as prepared, approved and published jointly by the American Public Health Association, The American Water Works Association and the Water Environment Federation, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided in subsection (h) of this section, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
(j)
Special arrangements. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.
