DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 109-31. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
The flood hazard areas of the City of Mountain Park are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Mountain Park, Georgia, does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.
(Ord. of 5-24-2021(2) , § 1)
Sec. 109-32. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and
(6)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the Mayor and City Council of the City of Mountain Park. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Mountain Park. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
(2)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of the county in which the affected property lies as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
(3)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(4)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(5)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(6)
In reviewing such requests, the mayor and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(7)
Conditions for variances:
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
(i)
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
(ii)
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
(iii)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided.
d.
The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(8)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the mayor and city council shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request.
(9)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the mayor and city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article.
(10)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."
