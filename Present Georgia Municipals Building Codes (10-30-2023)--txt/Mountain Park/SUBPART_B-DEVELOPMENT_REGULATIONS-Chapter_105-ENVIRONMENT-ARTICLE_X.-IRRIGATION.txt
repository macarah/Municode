ARTICLE X. - IRRIGATION

Sec. 105-408. - Conservation measures relating to lawn and landscape irrigation.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to reduce discretionary outdoor water use and avoid wasting water by adopting more efficient irrigation system design requirements.
(b)
Definitions.
(1)
Flow sensor means an inline device that produces a repeatable signal proportional to flow rate.
(2)
Landscape irrigation system means an assembly of component parts that is permanently installed for the controlled distribution of water to irrigate landscapes.
(3)
Landscape means ground cover, trees, shrubs, and other plants.
(4)
Large landscape means the landscape areas associated with a development (excluding single-family homes) served by one or more landscape irrigation systems where all irrigated areas added together total more than one acre (or 43,560 square feet).
(5)
Master shut-off valve is an automatic valve (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or butterfly valve) capable of being automatically closed by the WaterSense controller. When this valve is closed, water will not be supplied to the landscape irrigation system.
(6)
Rain sensor shut-off means an electric device that detects and measures rainfall amounts and overrides the cycle of a landscape irrigation system so as to turn off such system when a predetermined amount of rain has fallen.
(7)
WaterSense controller means weather-based irrigation controllers labeled under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense program, which includes standalone controllers, add-on devices, and plug-in devices that use current weather data as a basis for scheduling irrigation.
(c)
Applicability and exceptions. The section applies to all landscape irrigation systems except those (a) used for commercial agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. ยง 1-3-3, (b) used for golf courses, and (c) dependent upon a nonpublic water source.
(d)
Avoiding water waste through design. All landscape irrigation systems shall be designed, installed, maintained, and operated to prevent runoff from leaving the target landscape due to low-head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where water flows onto adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, walks, roadways, parking lots, or structures. This requirement helps ensure compliance with, and is in addition to, other portions of the City of Mountain Park's Code of Ordinances.
(e)
General landscape irrigation system requirements. Regardless of whether an irrigation meter is used, all new landscape irrigation systems for single-family residences shall include the following:
(1)
Backflow prevention assembly;
a.
Any new irrigation system installed within the city shall have installed an approved backflow prevention device at the point of service connection. The device must be tested after installation and annually, thereafter, by a certified tester in backflow prevention, pursuit to federal and state law for safe drinking water.
b.
Any irrigation system installed before January 1, 2007 must be retrofitted with an approved backflow prevention device no later than July 1, 2021. Failure to comply may result in the termination of water service.
(2)
A WaterSense controller; and
(3)
A rain sensor shut-off installed in an area that is unobstructed by trees, roof over hangs, or anything else that might block rain from triggering the rain sensor shutoff.
a.
Any new irrigation system installed within the city must be equipped with a rain sensing device. Although not mandatory, a freeze gauge is also recommended.
b.
Any irrigation system installed before January 1, 2005 shall be required to install a rain sensing device when irrigation system is repaired or replaced.
(f)
Large landscape irrigation system requirements. Regardless of whether an irrigation meter is used, new landscape irrigation systems for large landscapes shall include the following:
(1)
Applicable backflow prevention, a WaterSense controller, and the rain sensor shut-off as required of all new landscape irrigation systems;
(2)
A master shut-off valve for each controller installed as close as possible to the point of connection of the water but downstream of the backflow prevention assembly;
(3)
Pressure-regulating devices such as valve pressure regulators, sprinkler head pressure regulators, inline pressure regulators, or other devices shall be installed as needed to achieve the manufacturer's recommended pressure range at the emission devices for optimal performance; and
(4)
At least one flow sensor, which must be installed at or near the supply point of the landscape irrigation system, that when connected to the WaterSense controller will detect and report high flow conditions to such controller and automatically shut master valves.
(g)
Compliance self-certifications for one inch and larger service connections. As a condition of selling a new water meter or irrigation meter for any new service connection of one inch or larger, the purchaser of such meter shall submit a certification of compliance along with any other required paperwork and project information as may be required.
(1)
Such certification of compliance shall include a certification that one of the following is true and correct:
a.
The development will not include any landscape irrigation systems;
b.
The development will include a landscape irrigation system that does not serve a large landscape, and as a result the system will only include applicable backflow prevention, a WaterSense controller, and the rain sensor shut-off; or
c.
The development will include a landscape irrigation system that does serve a large landscape, and as a result all requirements in subsection (f) will be met.
(2)
For all new services connection of one inch or larger, the City of Mountain Park shall receive the signed certification of compliance and determine whether all required information has been provided. If the certification of compliance has not been completed with all required information, the City of Mountain Park shall return the certificate of compliance to the purchaser specifying what information is missing and ask that a complete certificate be resubmitted.
(h)
Variances. The mayor and city council may, in special cases, grant variances from the provisions of subsection (e)(2) or (3) to persons demonstrating extreme hardship and need. The mayor and city council may grant variances only under all of the following circumstances and conditions:
(1)
The applicant must sign a compliance agreement on forms provided by the city, and approved by the city attorney, agreeing to irrigate or water a lawn or landscape only in the amount and manner permitted by the variance.
(2)
Granting of a variance must not cause an immediate significant reduction in the city's water supply.
(3)
The extreme hardship or need requiring the variance must relate to the health, safety, or welfare of the person requesting it.
(4)
The health, safety, and welfare of other persons must not be adversely affected by granting the variance.
(i)
Revocation of variances. The mayor and city council may revoke a variance granted upon determining that:
(1)
The conditions of subsection (h) are not being met or are no longer applicable;
(2)
The terms of the compliance agreement are being violated; or
(3)
The health, safety, or welfare of other persons requires revocation.
(j)
Penalties for violations. Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00. Each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. Water service may also be terminated and the customer or consumer will be subject to a disconnection fee and reconnection fee once water is restored.
Violations include:
(1)
Installation, causing or permitting the installation of a new irrigation system in violation of subsections (e) and (f); or
(2)
Operating, causing or permitting the operation of an irrigation system that does not comply with subsections (e) and (f).
