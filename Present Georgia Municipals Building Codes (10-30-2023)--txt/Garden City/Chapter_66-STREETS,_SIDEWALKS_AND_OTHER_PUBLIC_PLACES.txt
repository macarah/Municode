In addition to the indemnification and liability provided for in sections 66-31(b) and 66-35, by accepting a permit hereunder for the installation of fiber optic cables within the city's right-of-way, a permittee is required to defend, indemnify, and hold the city whole and harmless from all costs, liabilities, and claims for damages of any kind arising out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its equipment, or out of any activity undertaken by it in or near a right-of-way, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a right-of-way permit. It further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit, or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the city for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation, maintenance, or operation of its fiber optic cables, or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether or not the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a right-of-way permit. The foregoing does not indemnify the city for its own negligence except for claims arising out of or alleging the city's negligence where such negligence arises out of or is primarily related to the presence, installation, construction, operation, maintenance or repair of the permittee's equipment by the permittee or on the permittee's behalf, including, but not limited to the issuance of permits and inspection of plans or work. This section is not, as to third parties, a waiver of any defense of immunity otherwise available to the city; and the permittee in defending any action of behalf of the city, shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the city could assert on its own behalf.

Sec. 66-75. - Same—Right-of-way vacation.
If the city vacates a right-of-way which contains the fiber optic cables of a permittee, the city shall reserve, to and for itself and all permittees having cables in the vacated right-of-way, the right to install, maintain and operate any equipment in the vacated right-of-way and to enter upon such right-of-way at any time for the purpose of reconstructing, inspecting, maintaining, or repairing the same.

Sec. 66-76. - Same—Abandoned or unusable cables.
A permittee who has determined to discontinue its cable operations in the city must either (a) provide information satisfactory to the city that the permittee's obligations for its cables in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another permittee; or (b) submit to the city a proposal and instruments for transfer and ownership of its cables to the city. If a permittee proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option, (a) purchase the equipment, or (b) require the permittee at its own expense, to remove it, or (c) require the permittee to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the cables. Cables of a permittee who fails to comply with the proceeding paragraph and which, for two years, remains unused shall be deemed to abandoned. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it may have at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession of the cables and restoring them to a usable condition, or (c) requiring removal of the cables by the permittee or by the permittee's surety under the bond required hereunder.

(Ord. No. 2001-2, § 1, 1-16-01)
Sec. 66-77. - Same—Other obligations.
Obtaining a right-of-way permit for the installation of fiber optic cables does not relieve the permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by any other governmental entity, or by laws or regulations. The permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and it is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work. Except in the case of an emergency, and with the approval of the city administrator, no right-of-way excavation may be performed when conditions are unreasonable for such work.
(Ord. No. 2001-2, § 1, 1-16-01)
Sec. 66-78. - Same—Revocation of permits.
Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this chapter for the installation of fiber optic cables as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without fee refund, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any condition of the permit. If the city administrator determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city administrator shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city administrator, at his discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the city administrator with a plan, acceptable to the city administrator, for its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the city administrator, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. If the permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.
