(2)
Provide documentation to prove that the applicant meets or exceeds the conditions of zoning pertaining to the property to be licensed; provide a site plan prepared and certified by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer depicting the location of the structure which will operate as the internet café; and pay the applicable license fee.

(3)
Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 35-3-35(a)(1.2), furnish a complete set of fingerprints for all owners of sole proprietorships, all officers and owners of 15 percent or more shares of any corporation, and all partners of partnerships in accordance with the following procedure: Two sets of fingerprints shall be taken by the Garden City Police Department and transmitted, together with the appropriate fees (unless a satisfactory billing arrangement has been entered into between the city and the State Identification Bureau) to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation will compare the subject's fingerprints against its criminal file and, if no disqualifying conduct is found therein, submit the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for comparison with nationwide records. The results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation check will be returned to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation which will disseminate the state and national results to the Garden City Police Department which shall forward the results to the city manager. In rendering a determination as to whether the applicant is fit to receive a license to operate an internet café within the city, the city manager will decide whether the applicant has been convicted of or is under pending indictment for:
a.
A crime which bears upon disability or fitness to operate an internet café within the city;
b.
Any felony or a misdemeanor which involves force or threat of force, controlled substance, or was a sex related offense; or

A criminal offense enumerated in subsection (c). The individual being fingerprinted may request and receive a copy of his/her criminal history record information from the city manager. Should the record subject seek to amend or correct his/her record, he/she must contact the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for a Georgia record or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for records from other jurisdictions maintained in its file.
(c)
No person, partnership, business, firm, or corporation shall be granted a license if the person, partner, or officers, or the owners of 15 percent or more of the shares of or any interest in any such business, firm, partnership or corporation have been convicted of or have pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, lottery, gambling, illegal possession or sale of any narcotics, drugs or chemicals for which the sale thereof is controlled or prohibited by law, the control of the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages, prostitution, solicitation or the possession or receiving of stolen property within a period of 15 years immediately prior to the filing of the application. Should any such person, partner, or officer or shareholder of a corporation, after a license has been granted, be convicted of or plead guilty or nolo contendere to any such crime, the license shall be subject to suspension or revocation. Withdrawal of an owner, officer, or partner or enumerated shareholder, after pleading guilty or nolo contendere to the above enumerated crimes, shall not necessarily mitigate against the penalty imposed in this section.
(d)
Upon receipt of a license application submission, the city manager shall promptly examine the application for completeness; if a completed application has been submitted, together with a tender of the requisite fees, the city manager shall issue a provisional license, good for 45 days, under which the applicant may commence operation of the business; the city manager shall diligently investigate the applicant(s) and verify all required information, within the 45-day period; applicants may be required to appear, in person, before the city manager, for examination; on or before the 45th day, the city manager shall either (1) deny the license, stating in writing all objective grounds or lack of qualifications found, or (2) grant the license. Written notice of action shall be promptly issued to the applicant at the address shown in the application, by certified mail, return receipt requested. Whenever an application for a license is denied under this article, the aggrieved applicant shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the written notice of denial to petition the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia, for a writ of certiorari; upon grant of the writ and motion by the petitioner for expedited hearing, the city attorney will consent to hear the matter as promptly as possible.

(Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 10-3-11)
Sec. 22-514. - Minor access to internet café subject to parental control.
(a)
It is hereby unlawful and a public nuisance for any proprietor, owner or operator of an internet café to provide access thereto by any person under the age of 18 years without the consent of said minor's parent or guardian. This protection is necessary to protect children from harmful material as hereinafter provided in this section. City council finds that exposure to such material is a matter of parental control or education through school or church or professional facilities designed to educate minors about sexual conduct. The display of the following explicit sexual activity, without parental control, in an unregulated setting is unlawful and a public nuisance. Such activity hereby prohibited in the presence of a minor is the following:
(1)
Material depicting or simulating between actual persons or animals or simulated persons, sexual conduct as follows:
a.
Sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals.
b.
Penetration of the vagina or rectum by an object.
c.
Masturbation for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.
d.
Sadomasochistic abuse for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.
e.
Exhibition of the genitals or the pubic or rectal area of any person for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.
f.
Defecation or urination for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.
(2)
Exhibition of the naked human body exposing female breasts, or male or female genitals, or the pubic or rectal area, or any part thereof.
(3)
The explicit exposure of any of the foregoing in any kind of sexual activity.
(4)
The explicit exposure of the above in explicit sexual activity in any kind of narrative, movie, act, play or story.
(5)
The foregoing applies whether the presentation is made by actual human beings or animals or simulated images thereof.
(b)
Nothing contained in the aforementioned paragraph (a) shall be deemed to prohibit the display of indecent, or harmful, or obscene material, except as otherwise prohibited by law, to persons over 18 attending an internet café. City council finds that there is no intent in enacting this section to censor, prohibit or oversee material legally accessible to adults through the internet.
(c)
A proprietor of an internet café, or employee or agent thereof, shall only allow a minor to attend said internet café where the minor produces a parental consent or control card in the form approved by the city unless said minor is accompanied by a parent or guardian. Failure of any internet café proprietor or manager or employee to require such a card from a minor unless accompanied by a parent or guardian is unlawful. Any minor found on the premises without such a parental access card unless accompanied by a parent or guardian shall be immediately ordered to leave the premises, and failure to do so by any adult employee of the internet café is unlawful. It is unlawful for any person to remain in or in the vicinity of an internet café when ordered to leave the same by a person in charge or a law enforcement officer. A proprietor of an internet café shall maintain at all times a sign in the form approved by the city on all doors providing access thereto that minors are not allowed unless accompanied by a parent or guardian or they have a parental access card.
(d)
The provisions of paragraph (c) are inapplicable to any owner or operator of an internet café who, as a condition to the granting of a license, agrees to the following additional conditions:
(1)
A sign shall be posted and maintained at all times on all doors giving access to the internet café stating in effect that "no adult materials are allowed to be accessed on the premises."
(2)
The proprietor agrees to install and maintain at all times in each computer to which anyone has access software or other device that will filter or block out adult materials as defined in paragraph (a). The type of filter or software adopted shall be in the discretion of the proprietor of the premises subject only to the city's inspection to determine whether applying the most recent state of the art that said filter or device reasonably blocks out the obnoxious material defined in paragraph (a). City council finds, determines, and orders that any city officer or employee in reviewing the software or device used to block out the undesirable materials shall be without discretion to determine what is obnoxious or obscene, and the sole function of the city officer or employee shall be to determine whether or not the software or device reasonably blocks out the activity described in paragraph (a). City council is aware that this is a growing state of the art and the device may not be effective in all cases, but city officers and employees shall require the proprietor to obtain the most reasonable and effective devices available at a reasonable charge.
(Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 10-3-11)
Sec. 22-515. - License revocation or suspension; hearing procedures.
(a)
No license which has been issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended or revoked except for due cause and after hearing and upon prior three-day written notice to the holder(s) of the license of the same, place and purpose of the hearing and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held.
(b)
The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to:
(1)
Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the licensee or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, a crime involving moral turpitude, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, sexual offenses, gambling, drug offenses, or tax laws.
(2)
Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by any of the licensee's employees or any person rendering services to the licensee as an independent contractor of the business for any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, sexual offenses, gambling, drug offenses, or tax laws.
(3)
Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the operation of the adult business.
(4)
Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this article or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor, including any renewal thereof. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this article shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented.
(5)
Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this article as a condition or qualification for holding a license, including payment of license fees and taxes when due.
(6)
Any other factor known to or discovered by the city manager whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any person holding an interest in a license, or any of the licensee's employees has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, administrative regulations, or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, sexual offenses, gambling or narcotics. With respect to this section, it shall be reputably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.
(c)
Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as it appears in the records of the city. The burden shall be on the licensee to provide notice, in writing, of any change of address for service of notices and process. In the case of service by mail of any notice required by this article, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Postal Service.
(d)
The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the mayor. The hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the state who is disinterested in the outcome of the proceeding.
(e)
Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. At the hearing, the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation.
(f)
The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten business days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the hearing officer's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision as to sanctions, if any. Such sanctions may include one or more of the following: immediate revocation of the license, suspension of the license for a time certain (which cannot exceed the time remaining on the license for the current calendar year), imposition of a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $1,000.00, and/or conditioning renewal of future licenses to a probationary period not to exceed two years. Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation.
(g)
The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court, upon application filed within 30 days of notice of the decision.
(h)
Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police and city attorney. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and nonappealable.
(Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 10-3-11)
Sec. 22-516. - Violation of article; sanctions.
(a)
Any person violating the provisions of this article shall be guilty of an offense against the city, punishable upon conviction by the municipal court, as set forth in section 1-13 of this Code. In addition to such fine or imprisonment, violation of this article shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of any license issued under this article. Each day a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
(b)
Any internet café business operated, conducted, or maintained contrary to the provisions of this article is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. In addition to or in lieu of prosecuting a violation under subsection (a) above, the city may seek an injunction against the continued operation and maintenance of the business in the superior court. In addition, violation of the provisions of this article shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of any license issued under this article.
