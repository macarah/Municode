ARTICLE V. - STANDARDS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAE AND TOWERS

Sec. 18-150. - Purpose.
This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications services. To that end, this article shall:
(1)
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city;
(2)
Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities;
(3)
Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovated camouflaging techniques;
(4)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae;
(5)
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(6)
Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and
(7)
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.
(Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1)
Sec. 18-151. - Definitions.

(Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1)
Sec. 18-154. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
(a)
Preferred location sites.
(1)
Co-location sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the building inspector or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive.
(2)
Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clocks or bell towers, light poles and churches.
(3)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstruction or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
(b)
Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multi-family duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1)
Sec. 18-155. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
(a)
General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article.
(1)
Building code and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the building inspector.
(2)
Regulatory compliance.
a.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
b.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
(3)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the building inspector may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(5)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this article are met.
(6)
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(7)
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The building inspector may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the building inspector.
(8)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
(9)
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
(10)
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided, however, that the building inspector may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
2.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
3.
Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 18-156.
b.
For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: a ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires a ten-foot setback from the edge of the roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
(b)
Additional requirements for towers.
(1)
Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
(2)
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
(3)
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(4)
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable.
(5)
When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance of at least equal to its total height.
(6)
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district.
(7)
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
(8)
Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
(9)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1)
Sec. 18-156. - Application procedures.
(a)
General application requirements for all building and special use permits.

Sec. 18-160. - Removal of antennae and towers.
All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the building inspector any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.

(a)
Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
(b)

(b)
A telecommunications facility that has received city approval as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives (October 6, 1997) in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired.
(c)
Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure.
(Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1)
Sec. 18-163. - Penalty for violation of article.

ARTICLE VI. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 18-201. - Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them:
Jurisdictional wetland. An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination. An official written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that states whether or not jurisdictional wetlands are present on a site.
Wetland delineation. A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended.
Wetlands inventory area. Wetlands identified on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency West Chatham County ADID Map of Wetlands and Uplands (ADID Map) where available or, for property outside the study area defined on the ADID Map, wetlands identified on the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for the county. A wetlands inventory area does not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland determination.
(Ord. of 2-21-00, § 1)
Sec. 18-202. - Wetlands assessment.
Prior to the issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit, the building inspector shall assess whether the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands, and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area. To assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the building inspector shall consult with the current ADID map. If the proposed activity is not located within the study area defined on the ADID map, the building inspector shall consult the current NWI map for the county.
(1)
If the building inspector determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, the building inspector shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit.
(2)
If the building inspector determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands and that the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to the issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit.
a.
If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that a Department of the Army permit is required, a building permit or a demolition permit shall be issued only following issuance of the Department of the Army permit.
b.
If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that the proposed activity would not require a Department of the Army permit, the building inspector shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit.
(Ord. of 2-21-00, § 1)
Sec. 18-203. - Effect of wetlands assessment.
Wetlands inventory areas as identified above and defined in section 18-201 do not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetlands delineation. No permit issued pursuant to these regulations relieves a landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 2-21-00, § 1)
Sec. 18-204. - Exceptions.
This article should not apply if the applicant can provide to the building inspector a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wetland delineation that verifies whether the proposed activity is not located within jurisdictional wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit or a letter that authorizes the proposed activity within jurisdictional wetlands. If such evidence of compliance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permitting requirements is provided, the building inspector shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a demolition permit.

ARTICLE VII. - DEMOLITION OF DAMAGED STRUCTURES AFTER A DISASTER

Sec. 18-301. - Intent.
This article establishes demolition criteria for all buildings and structures damaged as a result of an event as defined below to the degree that demolition is the only alternative to remove the imminent threat to the public health and safety.
(Ord. No. 2008-14, § 1, 5-5-08)
Sec. 18-302. - Application.
The provisions of this article are applicable to all buildings, structures, and building sites regulated by the city.
(Ord. No. 2008-14, § 1, 5-5-08)
Sec. 18-303. - Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply:
Demolition means the act or process of reducing a structure, as defined by state or local code, to a collapsed state.
Event means any natural or human-created occurrence which results in a disaster declaration by a governmental entity, including the mayor and council, the governor of the State of Georgia, and the President of the United States, authorized to issue such a declaration and shall include wind storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, aftershocks, fires, floods, hazardous materials incidents and other occurrences resulting in a disaster declaration.
Unsafe structure means a structure found to be dangerous to the life, health or safety of the public because such structure is so damaged or structurally unsafe as a direct result of the declared disaster that partial or complete collapse is imminent.
(Ord. No. 2008-14, § 1, 5-5-08)
Sec. 18-304. - Demolition criteria.
(a)
Following an event, any unsafe structure determined by the building official to present an imminent hazard to public health and safety or to pose an imminent threat to the public right-of-way as a direct result of the declared disaster may be condemned and immediately demolished as follows:
(1)
Such condemnation and demolition shall be performed in the interest of public health and safety without hearings otherwise required by the city's nuisance abatement ordinances pursuant to the direction of the city administrator.
(2)
Prior to commencing demolition, the building official shall photographically record the entire unsafe building or structure to the extent reasonably feasible without endangering city personnel or the public health and safety and he or she shall prepare a written statement of structural deficiency. Failure to photograph the structure or prepare the written statement of structural deficiencies shall not invalidate any proceeding under this article.
(3)
The building official shall exercise reasonable diligence to give prompt written notice of the intended demolition prior to demolition. Notice shall be given by first-class mail postage prepaid to the last known owner of record shown in the public records. The written notice shall state the street address and parcel number of the structure intended for demolition. The written notice required by this article shall not delay demolition of any unsafe structure. The failure of any owner to receive notice prior to demolition shall not invalidate any proceeding pursuant to this article.
(4)
Demolition shall not be pursued with respect to any structure which the building official determines can, within a reasonable time limit, be braced, shored or otherwise secured by fencing or other means in such a manner as to mitigate the imminent hazard or threat.
(Ord. No. 2008-14, § 1, 5-5-08)
