ARTICLE III. - FIRE PROTECTION UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND

Sec. 34-71. - Purpose.
This article establishes the Garden City Fire Protection Utility and sets up the fire protection utility enterprise fund.
(Ord. No. 2010-15, § 1, 10-18-10)
Sec. 34-72. - Findings of fact.
modified
The Garden City Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact:
(1)
The City of Garden City is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VI thereof, to create special service districts for the provision of services within such districts, and to levy and collect within such districts fees and assessments to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such services therein.
(2)
The City of Garden City, Georgia, is authorized by its Charter to fix and establish fire protection service area limits and to extend, enlarge or restrict same from time to time to ensure effective delivery of such services.
(3)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this article, Garden City is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide fire protection services to all properties within the city's service area. Fire protection services are needed and provide benefits to all properties within the city's service area.
(4)
The cost of managing, operating and maintaining the Garden City Fire Department, and the funding necessary for equipment, personnel and facilities thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in reasonable relationship to the services received by the public from the city's fire department and the fire protection program.
(5)
The operational and financing analysis prepared by the city properly assesses and defines the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities as well as the city fire department's funding strategy for delivery of those services.
(6)
Given the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities and the funding strategy identified in the aforementioned financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of fire protection services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other resource management programs.
(7)
Fire protection services are applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, one service area encompassing all lands within the designated Garden City Fire Protection Utility Service Area is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(8)
It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of fire protection among the owners and/or occupants of all properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's fire department which result in services being rendered to such properties and the owners and/or occupants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the service fee charge should be based on a reasonable correlation to the fire protection services made available and provided to all properties.
(9)
The fire protection needs of the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of fire protection services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city.
(10)
A fire protection program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering fire protection services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement the defined level of service for fire protection within the city are through fire protection service fee charges and other funding mechanisms.
(11)
Reserved.
(12)
Fire protection service fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, general fund revenues, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(13)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site fire protection/suppression facilities or systems which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the response burden imposed on the fire department, and the fire protection utility's cost of providing fire protection services, should be taken into account with regard a potential reduction to the service fee charge on that property in the form of a service fee charge reduction or a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such facilities in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the fire protection utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained fire protection/suppression facilities, systems and/or programs shall be generally proportional to the effect that such facilities, systems and programs have on reduction and/or mitigation of the fire risk and incident response burden associated with the property and the reduction in cost associated with provision of fire protection services related to that property.
(14)
It is imperative that the revenue from all service fee charges for fire protection services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such service fee charge revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city fire protection utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for fire protection capital and operations costs, or for other indebtedness for fire protection services.
(15)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Garden City hereby concludes a fire protection utility, funded by a dedicated fire protection utility enterprise fund, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the community's fire protection service delivery needs. By separate ordinance, the city will enact a service charge rate structure to establish service fees for the provision of fire protection services to all properties within the defined Garden City Fire Protection Utility Service Area.

Sec. 34-103. - Fire protection utility customer classes.
modified
(a)
The fire protection utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in building structure and contents; needed fire flow; fire protection services provided by the city to the fire protection utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the Garden City Fire Department (GCFD), water supply system, and fire protection vehicles and equipment. All state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. The fire protection utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows:
(1)
The single-family residential (SFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as SFR customers per the applicable definition.

modified
(a)
The fire protection utility shall impose a fire protection fee on all properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. The fire protection utility shall apportion the cost of delivering fire protection services to all properties based on the demand the property places on the GCFD and the fire protection services provided.
(b)
Fire protection fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the governing body of the city. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of Garden City. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable and, together with other funding sources available to the Garden City Fire Protection Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to fire protection services, are sufficient to support the cost of the GCFD, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(c)
The basis for calculation of the fire protection fee charge to all property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, the acreage of each land parcel, the square footage of structures, and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver fire protection services and to calculate the fire protection fee charges for all properties in the city.
(d)
Fire protection fees shall be reflective of the following two important factors in establishing the city's cost to provide fire protection services to individual properties, including:
(1)
The acreage of each parcel of land; and
(2)
The square footage of structures on each property.
(e)
The total fire protection fee for each SFR and NSFR property shall include two charges as described below:
(1)
Wildfire charge: This charge shall apply to all properties within the fire protection service area. This charge shall be based upon the total acreage of the parcel. The annual rate per acre of land shall be established by resolution of the city council.
(2)
Structure charge: This charge shall be applied to all properties upon which any structure is built. This charge shall be based upon the square footage of all structures on the property. The annual rate per square foot of structure area shall be established by resolution of the city council.
(3)
Undeveloped property shall only receive a wildfire charge.

The fire protection fee charge is not a tax and no exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in fire protection fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the fire protection utility's cost of providing fire protection services and facilities.
(b)
Exemptions to the fire protection fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Linear rights-of-way (i.e., roads, tracks, rails, roadbed) outside of defined parcel limits shall be exempt from fire protection fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of the right of the GCFD to collect emergency response fees for emergency response services provided within the right-of-way.

The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city.
b.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate information to the fire protection utility manager, including, but not limited to, inspection reports from a certified fire protection professional or building construction plans certified by a registered architect or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city information. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the fire protection utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request.
