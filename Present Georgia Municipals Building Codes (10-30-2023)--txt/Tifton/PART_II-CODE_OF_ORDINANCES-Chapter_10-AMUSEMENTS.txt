The following special reports relating to the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments on real property values:
(1)
May 2008, Survey of Florida Appraisers: Effects of Land Use on Market Values, Palm Beach County, Florida ;
and numerous other studies, articles, and court decisions referenced within the above studies, articles and court decisions and are hereby incorporated by reference along with the studies, articles and court decisions listed above which have been presented to the mayor and city council in bound form and/or in electronic format and are incorporated into the record of the proceedings before the governing body of the City of Tifton.
Based upon all of this evidence, the City of Tifton Governing Body finds:
• Sexually oriented businesses, also known as adult entertainment establishments, lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or inadequately controlled by the operators of the establishments. The commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned. Sexually oriented businesses cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use, assaults and batteries, and corruption of public officials.
• Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses. Offering or providing private or semi-private space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
• Adult entertainment establishments escalate and exacerbate undesirable community conditions, including but not limited to blight, diminished property values, increased need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increased burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the governing body finds such business establishments bring to a community. The secondary negative effects that are caused by such businesses are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but other forms of sexually oriented businesses that also have a deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include but are not limited to adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift and novelty shops and lingerie or nude modeling studios.
• Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
• Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses.
• AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components.
• According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
• Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
• Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in some areas of some sexually oriented businesses.
These findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns and, therefore, the City of Tifton Governing Body further finds:
• Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
• Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments as defined herein.
• Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
• The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other secondary negative effects as described herein.
• It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
• The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
• The barring of such individuals from the management of adult entertainment establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
• The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities as described above, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Tifton, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence presented to the mayor and city council (hereinafter "the governing body") held prior to the adoption of this chapter; and, the governing body for the City of Tifton, Georgia takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the finding of the governing body that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same or similar deleterious effects on the community.
Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with commercial nudity and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment, are criminal activity, depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove referenced. The governing body finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the City of Tifton, Georgia, as well unless these regulations are adopted.
Furthermore, it is the finding of the governing body that live nude or semi-nude entertainment and other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in the city and surrounding communities.
The governing body further finds that each separate adverse secondary effect of adult entertainment businesses and sexually oriented businesses constitutes a substantial government interest, that each substantial government interest includes, but is not limited to, preventing future adverse secondary effects of both pre-existing sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment businesses in the city and those that may open in the future, and the viability of each separate substantial government interest of the city addressed herein does not depend upon any comparative analysis between adult entertainment businesses and non-adult entertainment businesses.
The governing body therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the city, the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the governing body of the city finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment, and finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions. The governing body further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To all of these ends, this chapter is hereby adopted.
Also based upon all of the information, studies, reports, statements, findings in court decisions, and testimony referenced above, as well as the well known and self evident conditions and secondary effects caused by the commercial exploitation of commercial total nudity combined with the sale, dispensing and consumption of alcoholic beverages, the governing body also finds and concludes that the sale, dispensing, or consumption of alcoholic beverages of any kind in an adult entertainment establishment as defined herein tends to independently create, aggravate, exacerbate, and add to all of those negative secondary effects set forth in this section. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to address and forestall those negative secondary effects in the City of Tifton, Georgia within the permissible limits and parameters of the Georgia and United States constitutions.

(a)
It shall be unlawful for any person, association, partnership, or corporation to operate, engage in, conduct, or carry on, in or upon any premises within the corporate city limits of the City of Tifton, Georgia any adult entertainment establishment as defined in this chapter without first procuring an annual license to do so except as provided in subsection 10-41(b) of this article when the governing body fails to approve or deny an application for an adult entertainment license within the 30-day period provided for therein. In no event shall any license issued to an adult entertainment establishment under this chapter be in force or effect after midnight of December 31 of the year in which it is issued. The issuance of such an annual license shall not be deemed to authorize, condone or make legal any activity thereunder if the same is deemed illegal or unlawful under the laws of the State of Georgia or the United States.
(b)
There shall be an annual regulatory fee for each adult entertainment establishment licensed within the city in an amount established by the city's governing body. The annual regulatory fee must be paid to the city within ten days after the governing body approves the application for an adult entertainment establishment license or a renewal thereof. No adult entertainment establishment license or renewal thereof shall be issued until the most recent annual regulatory fee has been paid. All licenses granted hereunder shall expire at midnight on December 31 of the year in which they are issued. Licensees who desire to renew their license shall file an application with the city clerk on the form provided for renewal of the license for the ensuing year. Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year. Any applicant filing a renewal application which is received by the city after November 30 shall pay, in addition to said annual regulatory fee, a late charge of 20 percent, and shall cease conducting business on the premises effective midnight December 31 until a renewal license is duly issued under this chapter. If a license renewal application is received after January 1, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held, and the applicant shall cease conducting business on the premises until a renewal license is duly issued under this chapter. If a license application is received after January 1, investigative and administrative costs as set forth in this chapter will be assessed. All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year and the full annual regulatory fee must be paid for a license renewal application filed prior to July 1 of the license year. One-half of a full annual regulatory fee shall be paid for a license renewal application filed after July 1 of the license year. Any person renewing any license issued hereunder who shall pay the annual regulatory fee, or any portion thereof, after January 1, shall, in addition to said annual regulatory fee and late charges, pay simple interest on the delinquent balance at the annual rate then charged by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States on unpaid federal income taxes.
(c)
The regulatory fee provided for in subsection (b) of this section shall be fixed by the governing body in an amount that will defray, in part, the costs incurred by the city through the enforcement of this chapter. The regulatory fee shall be exclusive of, and shall not include any costs of, licensing adult entertainment establishments under this chapter.
(d)
Licenses and permits issued under this chapter shall not be transferable, except for a license or ownership interest under the following circumstances: in case of the death of an owner or a licensee as defined herein, the license pertaining to the owner's or licensee's adult entertainment establishment shall remain in force and effect for a period of up to 30 days in order to allow the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) who will inherit the ownership interest or license an opportunity to apply for and qualify to hold the interest or license under this chapter. In order to qualify to hold said interest or license, the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) shall make application to the city within the 30-day period as if he or she were applying for a new ownership interest or license under this chapter. If a completed application is filed within the 30-day period, then the existing license shall remain in effect for an additional period of up to 30 days following the date of filing in order to allow the governing body to grant or deny the application under this chapter. If the governing body grants the application, or if the application is deemed granted because of a failure to approve or deny the same within the 30-day period provided for in this chapter, then the beneficiary applicant(s) shall become the new owner(s) of the interest or license, which shall be considered transferred without any interruption of ownership interest which may have existed from the original approval of same, said interest or license being thereafter subject to all of the terms and conditions of this chapter. If the beneficiary fails to file a completed application under this subsection within the 30-day period, or if the application is denied (and if appealed, the denial is upheld on appeal), then the ownership interest or license shall terminate at midnight on the 30th day or at midnight on the day that a final judgment upholding the appeal is entered, and the adult entertainment establishment shall close its business on that day; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to allow or permit any license to remain in force and effect beyond midnight on December 31 of the year in which the death occurs, unless necessary to allow for one or both of the two 30-day periods provided for in this subsection. If an appeal of a denial might remain pending on December 31 of the year in which it is filed, then in such an event, the beneficiary applicant shall file a new application for a license or approval of an ownership interest for the next succeeding calendar year under the terms of this chapter.
(e)
All other changes in an ownership interest in an adult entertainment establishment or a license issued under this chapter must be reported in writing to the city manager prior to such transfer, and the person who is intended to receive such ownership interest shall be required to make an application for a license as if he or she were applying for a new license hereunder. No licensee may change the location of the licensee's operation; any change in location shall require application for a new license under this chapter, so that such application process is completed before the relocation takes place.
