Purpose. Residents of the city as well as persons doing business with the municipal government have a right to expect that city officials will behave in a manner conducive to promoting public confidence in the municipal government. The purpose of this code is to:
(1)
Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all city officials;
(2)
Establish guidelines for the conduct that is to be expected of city officials at meetings, events, and appearances sponsored by the city;
(3)
Require disclosure of all conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, by city officials in matters concerning or affecting the city; and
(4)
Set forth disciplinary measures that may be taken against city officials who choose to violate the code of ethics and conduct.
(b)
City officials. The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to the following city officials: the mayor; members of the city council; and members of the planning and zoning commission, zoning board of appeals, and any additional board(s) that may be established and duly appointed by the mayor and council.
(c)
Prohibited activities. No city official shall:
(1)
Provide reason by his or her conduct for the impression that any person can improperly influence him or her or unduly enjoy his or her favor in the performance of official acts;
(2)
Use his or her official position to secure or attempt to secure privileges that are not available to the general public;
(3)
Perform any activity or engage in any transaction that is prohibited by law now existing or hereafter enacted which is applicable to him or her by virtue of being a city official;
(4)
Directly or indirectly request, exact, receive, or agree to receive a loan, gift, favor, promise, or thing of value for himself or herself or another person if it could reasonably be considered to influence the city official in the discharge of official duties. This shall not apply in the case of an occasional non-pecuniary gift of insignificant value; an award publicly presented in recognition of public service; a commercially reasonable loan or other financial transaction made in the ordinary course of business by an institution or individual authorized by the laws of Georgia to engage in the making of such a loan or financial transaction; and campaign contributions made and reported in accordance with state law;
(5)
Disclose or otherwise use confidential information acquired by virtue of his or her position for his or her or another person's private gain;
(6)
Engage in, or accept employment with, or render services for any private business or professional activity when such employment or rendering of services is adverse to and incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties. This shall not apply to a city official who is a licensed professional and appears on behalf of any applicant in such professional capacity so long as disclosures required by subsection (d) are made to the mayor and city council 30 days prior to any action being taken, and the member is associated with the project at the time the initial application is filed;
(7)
Use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to himself or herself or persons having an interest;
(8)
Use government property of any kind for other than officially approved activities, nor direct employees to use such property for any purposes other than those officially approved; and
(9)
Use his or her position to request or require an employee of the city to do clerical work on behalf of the city official's family, business, social club, church, or fraternal interest when such work is not furthering a legitimate city interest; perform any work outside the employee's normal course of employment with the city; purchase goods or services to be used for personal, business, or political purposes; and work for the city official personally without paying the employee just compensation.
(d)
Disclosure of conflicts of interest. An appointed city official (i.e., members of planning and zoning commission and other boards appointed by the city council) who has a financial interest that he or she has reason to believe may be affected by his or her official acts or actions shall disclose the precise nature of such financial interest by written or verbal statement 30 days prior to the city council's taking official action on a matter affecting such interest, and shall abstain from discussion and voting. An elected city official (i.e., the mayor and members of the city council) shall disclose the nature of any financial interest he or she has at the time such matter is presented to the mayor and city council for discussion. Such written or verbal statements shall be recorded into the minutes of the meeting and thus become part of the public record. Following any disclosure made pursuant to this section, the member shall refrain from all ex-parte communications with other members regarding the application in which he or she has a financial interest.
(e)
Prohibited contracts. The city council shall not enter into any contract involving services or property with a member of the city council or with a business in which a member of the city council has a financial interest. This shall not apply in the case of the designation of a bank or trust company as a depository of city funds; the borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution which offers the lowest available rate of interest in the community for such loan; contracts entered into in accordance with the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; or contracts entered into under circumstances that constitute an emergency situation, provided that the mayor or his designee prepares a written record explaining the emergency.

Prohibited conduct at public meetings, hearings, events, and appearances. No city official shall:

Treat any member of the general public or other city official or employee in a fashion designed to demean, degrade, or humiliate that individual;
(3)
Intentionally and/or repeatedly violate Robert's Rules of Order, the general guidelines by which the city council and appointed boards of the city conduct their meetings.
(g)
Exceptions. This Code section is not intended to apply in the following circumstances:
(1)
City officials are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community do;
(2)
City officials retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights;
(3)
It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for city officials to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material, and avoidable;
(4)
City officials are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain their investments; and
(5)
It is possible and reasonable to require city officials to engage in employment, professional or business activities and to maintain investments which do not impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the community.
(h)
Hearings and determinations. Upon the sworn complaint of any person alleging facts that, if proven to be true, would constitute a violation of this Code section as determined by the city manager and the city attorney, the city council shall conduct a public hearing at which the accused city official shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either personally or through counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing, the city council shall, in written findings of fact and conclusions based thereon, make a determination concerning the propriety of the conduct of the city official in question.
