DIVISION 2. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

Sec. 10-42. - Adult entertainment establishment; findings; public purpose.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, College Park, Carrollton, and Whitfield County, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the county, the commissioners take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable counties in the state.
(b)
Moreover, it is the finding of the commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the county.
(c)
Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described.
(d)
Furthermore, it is the finding of the county commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters and massage parlors, have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general.
(e)
Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment facilities by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses; to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas.
(f)
Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the county is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
(Code 1992, § 10-30)

Should any such person, partner, or officer or shareholder of a corporation, after a license has been granted, be convicted of or pled guilty or nolo contendere to any such crime, said license shall be subject to suspension and revocation. Withdrawal of an owner, officer or partner or enumerated shareholder, after pleading guilty or nolo contendere to the above-enumerated crimes, shall not necessarily mitigate against the penalty imposed hereby.

State Law reference— Pawnbrokers, O.C.G.A. § 44-12-130 et seq.

Sec. 10-68. - Short title.
This division shall be known as the Wayne County Pawnshops and Pawnbrokers Ordinance.
(Code 1992, § 10-40; Ord. of 7-6-2015, § 1)
Sec. 10-69. - Findings and intent.
(a)
This division is adopted to address and promote the interests of public safety, health and welfare of the county and its citizens, to aid and assist in the recovery of stolen property, to aid and assist local law enforcement in fulfilling its public safety functions, and to facilitate peaceful, lawful, orderly and efficient pawn brokering within the county.
(b)
The county recognizes that pawnshops or pawnbrokers are legitimate businesses authorized by or otherwise permitted under state law. However, the county finds that the services offered by such forms of business may provide an opportunity for individuals to potentially transfer stolen property to those businesses. The county also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving these businesses. The county further finds that the various pawn transactions of pawnshops or pawnbrokers have expanded beyond the county's current ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to them. The purpose of the county's regulation of pawnshops or pawnbrokers is to prevent such forms of business from being used to facilitate the commission of crimes and also to ensure that they comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens, pursuant to authority granted to the county by state law and the constitution of the state.

Pledged goods means tangible personal property, including, without limitation, all types of motor vehicles or any motor vehicle certificate of title, which such property is purchased by, deposited with, or otherwise actually delivered into the possession of a pawnbroker or a pawnshop in connection with a pawn transaction. However, for purposes of this division, possession of any motor vehicle certificate of title which has come into the possession of a pawnbroker or a pawnshop through a pawn transaction made in accordance with applicable law shall be conclusively deemed to be possession of the motor vehicle, and the pawnbroker or the pawnshop may retain physical possession of the motor vehicle certificate of title for the entire length of the pawn transaction, but shall not be required in any way to retain physical possession of the motor vehicle at any time.
