Chapter 15 - UTILITIES
ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 15-1. - Purpose.
This article shall serve the purpose of establishing the City of Duluth Stormwater Utility.
(Ord. of 6-13-11; Ord. No. O-2022-24 , 7-11-22)
Sec. 15-2. - Findings of fact.
The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact:
(1)
The City of Duluth is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. ยง 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Duluth (hereinafter "the City" or "Duluth").
(2)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this article, Duluth is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(3)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff may:
a.
Cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city.
b.
Adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by Gwinnett County thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
c.
Contribute to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources.
(4)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for implementation of its comprehensive stormwater management program and drainage-related capital improvement needs.
(5)
The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's national pollutant discharge elimination system (hereinafter "NPDES") phase I stormwater permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(6)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the city's NPDES phase I stormwater permit, the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD), the city's comprehensive plan and the other applicable regulatory programs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater management program implementation, water quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital construction and other program activities.
(7)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program.
(8)
The professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's stormwater consultant properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and operational costs as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. The applicable supporting, project-related documents that are incorporated herein by reference include the following: Stormwater Management Program Assessment and Cost Analysis (Technical Memorandum No. 1 dated January 28, 2011); Stormwater Utility User Fee Recommendations Memorandum (Project Memorandum dated April 25, 2011); and Stormwater Utility Implementation (Technical Memorandum Addendum dated April 25, 2011, or the most recent version).
(9)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(10)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the City of Duluth is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(11)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management program which results in services being provided to such properties and the owners thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge should correlate to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city's stormwater management program.
(12)
The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, businesses, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways even though the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable.
(13)
A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management service delivery within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms.
(14)
The amount of impervious surface on each improved property is the most important factor influencing stormwater runoff characteristics and these characteristics bear a rational nexus to the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property. As a result, the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge.
(15)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts.
(16)
Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(17)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property.
(18)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the City of Duluth Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.
(19)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of the City of Duluth hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund. The city will enact a stormwater utility rate ordinance in the future to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services.

(5)
In any platted single family residential subdivision, any pipe or other manmade structurally artificial conveyance which conveys water from within the public road rights-of-way maintained by the city or public road easements maintained by the city to its point of discharge. This shall not include any pipes or other manmade conveyances that convey water from private property to public rights-of-way/road easements and/or discharge on public rights-of-way/road easements.
(c)
Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities which are located on private or public property not owned by the city, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to the city for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the state and federal laws and regulations.
(d)
The stormwater utility may provide stormwater management services to privately owned stormwater management systems and facilities to ascertain that said facilities are functioning as designed and approved. The stormwater utility may provide for remedial maintenance of said private facilities based upon the severity of stormwater problems and potential hazard to the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment, and in cases where such remedial maintenance is required the city reserves the right to bill the owner or owners of said private facility for the costs of such maintenance.
(e)
It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the municipal boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship.
(f)
If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its city council members, mayor, officers, employees or agents.
(Ord. of 6-13-11; Ord. No. O-2022-24 , 7-11-22)
Sec. 15-7. - Stormwater user fee charges.
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services by the city.
(b)
The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to all developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for all developed properties in the city.
(c)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a reasonable connection, or rational nexus, to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein.
(d)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities, or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(e)
The stormwater user fee charges shall accrue beginning July 1, 2011 and shall be billed periodically by the city thereafter via a method established by the mayor and city council.
(Ord. of 6-13-11; Ord. No. O-2022-24 , 7-11-22)
Sec. 15-8. - Stormwater utility customer classes.
The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the stormwater utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system components. All publicly owned, developed properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties, unless otherwise exempted. The stormwater utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows:
(1)
The detached single family residential (DSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as DSFR customers per the applicable definition.
(2)
The attached single family residential (ASFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as ASFR customers per the applicable definition.
(3)
The non-single family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition.
(4)
The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition.
(5)
Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection.
(Ord. of 6-13-11; Ord. No. O-2022-24 , 7-11-22)
Sec. 15-9. - Stormwater utility user fee charge rates.
(a)
The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee on all developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner, including, except as otherwise provided herein. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program, the stormwater services provided by the city to that property and the benefits derived.
(b)
The mayor and city council shall establish by ordinance the stormwater user fee charge rates, and the billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city council from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Duluth Stormwater Utility. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk for public inspection. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the Duluth Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(c)
Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to two thousand nine hundred ninety-seven (2,997) square feet of impervious surface.
(d)
Gravel and compacted soil associated with driveways, parking areas, roads and all other areas that consist of these types of surface (or near surface) conditions on developed property will be designated as impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. The total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at eighty-five (85) percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics and infiltration capabilities of these materials.
(e)
Calculation of user fee charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be calculated by multiplying the stormwater user fee billing rate (per ERU) times the number of ERUs for each customer account. The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge for each customer account shall be in general accordance with the following:
(1)
DSFR customer class. Each DSFR customer account shall be charged a flat rate of 1.0 ERU except as noted below:
a.
If a DSFR customer account consists of more than eight thousand nine hundred ninety-one (8,991) square feet of impervious surface (or three (3.0) ERUs), the customer account for that parcel will be charged as per the NSFR calculation described herein.
(2)
ASFR customer class. Each ASFR customer account shall be charged a flat rate of 0.5 ERU.
(3)
NSFR customer class. Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 ERU for each two thousand nine hundred ninety-seven (2,997) square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one (1) decimal place to establish the total number of ERUs for billing.
(4)
Undeveloped land customer class. Undeveloped land shall not be charged a stormwater user fee.

ARTICLE III. - SPECIAL DISTRICTS FOR RESIDENTIAL STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES

Sec. 15-30. - Findings.
The city finds that there are many private stormwater management systems and facilities that have been constructed over the course of many years within the city and that many of these exist in states of disrepair or have the potential to fail with potentially damaging consequences to water quality and environmental health, as well as damage to private and public property in the city. With this threat to the health, welfare, and safety of the public in mind, the city enacts the following procedures by which those property owners utilizing private stormwater management systems and facilities may dedicate the maintenance of those systems to the city.
(Ord. No. O-2022-24 , 7-11-22)
Sec. 15-31. - Creation of special districts for stormwater management systems and facilities.
(a)
Any private residential lot owner served by a private stormwater management system or facility located within the city limits may present a request to be included in a special district to the city. Upon receipt of the request, the city shall determine the appropriate boundaries for the proposed special district for stormwater management that will serve the lot owner presenting the request and neighboring lot owners. The boundary shall consist of the residential neighborhood property served by a private stormwater management system or facility.
(b)
Upon receipt of a request, and after review, the city shall prepare a map showing the area for the proposed special district for stormwater management, identifying all the private property as well as any private stormwater maintenance systems or facilities within the proposed district. The city shall inspect and evaluate the condition of the private system and prepare a cost estimate. The cost estimate shall indicate the expected cost of making initial necessary repairs to the stormwater maintenance systems or facilities as well as an annual cost for maintenance thereafter.
(c)
Once the city has prepared the map and estimated the costs, the map and the cost estimate shall be made a part of a petition that may then be circulated among the private lot owners within the proposed district.
(d)
If a petition bearing signatures of more than fifty (50) percent of the lot owners in the proposed district is returned to the city within one (1) year of creation of the original petition by the city, the city shall verify the signatures on the petition and verify that the signatures represent more than fifty (50) percent of the private lot owners in the proposed district. After satisfactory verification, the petition shall be presented to the city council. The city council shall conduct a public hearing for the purpose of determining whether to create the proposed special district for stormwater management. Notice in a newspaper of general circulation shall be advertised at least fifteen (15) days before the public hearing indicating the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. At least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing, a sign shall be placed on the city right-of-way at each public entrance to the subdivision advertising the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, and notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing shall be mailed to each property owner identified by tax records.
(e)
Should the city council determine the creation of the district to be in the best interest of the city, they shall approve the creation of said district by ordinance or resolution. Said districts shall exist until such time as city council repeals the ordinance or for the time provided in the resolution creating such district; provided however that no such district shall exist for a period of more than ten (10) years. The map and cost estimates of such special districts shall be maintained at city hall and be open to public inspection.
(f)
Should the city council determine the creation of the district is not in the best interest of the city, no such request containing any of the area included in the proposed district may be proposed to the city for a period of two (2) years.
(Ord. No. O-2022-24 , 7-11-22)
Sec. 15-32. - Fees assessed in special districts.
(a)
Fees shall be assessed on each private lot within a special district created pursuant to section 15-31 in an amount necessary to pay the costs of initial repair of the stormwater system or facilities within the district. Such fees shall be in addition to and not in lieu of the city stormwater fee in article I and article II of this chapter.
(b)
The fee may be billed separately, on a customer statement and collected along with other fees for services, or on a customer ad valorem tax statement, at the city's sole discretion, provided that in no instance shall the service fee constitute a direct lien against the parcel. Unpaid fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby.
