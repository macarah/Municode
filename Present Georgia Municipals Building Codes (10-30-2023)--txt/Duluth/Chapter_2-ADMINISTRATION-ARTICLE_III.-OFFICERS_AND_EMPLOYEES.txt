DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 2-46. - Commencement of terms of elected officials.
The terms of the elected officials of the city shall begin at the first organizational meeting in January following a general election in accordance with the terms of O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.
(Ord. of 12-27-88; Ord. No. O-2022-32, § VII, 10-10-22)
Sec. 2-47. - Per diem, lodging, travel and overnight expenses of employees.
(a)
General travel guidelines. This travel policy is hereby established to facilitate reimbursement for expenses incurred while attending training, meetings, or events that are directly related and necessary to the employee performing their official duties and who will be traveling outside the immediate area for approved city business. Employees are responsible for knowing the city's travel policy and for abiding by the policy.
Any employee traveling to or attending a training, meeting, or other event held out-of-state which has not been approved through the budget must obtain pre-approval by the department director or city manager prior to such travel.
Reimbursement for meals within a fifty-mile radius of an employee's regular work location or residence is not allowable, unless expressly provided herein. The daily per diem allowance includes all taxes and meal tips and is divided into breakfast, lunch and dinner amounts in order to allow employees to deduct specific meals, where required. Any meal included in a conference or registration fee will not be reimbursed, and the per diem allowance must be reduced by the applicable meal rate. Any employee seeking reimbursement shall submit a copy of the meeting or conference agenda at the time of making the request in order to confirm which, if any, meals are included.
(b)
Per diem. Per diem meals and incidental expenses will be reimbursed according to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA Per Diem) schedule of per diem rates as found at http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem for the metro-Atlanta area. This allowance is intended to cover food, non-alcoholic beverages and out-of-pocket expenses not covered through registration fees while an employee is performing their official duties while outside of the fifty-mile radius of their regular work location or residence, and which requires an overnight stay. An employee may opt to forgo the standard federal per diem rate according to the GSA schedule of per diem and turn in actual receipts for expenses. However, the total of such receipts may not exceed the allowable amount per the GSA per diem schedule. Per diem may be advanced prior to departure based on the GSA rate and the expected number of days of travel. Unexpended per diem is not refundable to the city, unless it is received in advance and travel was less than the expected duration. Receipts need not be kept to support or justify standard per diem.
For day seminars within the fifty-mile radius, where lunch is not included in the registration fee and prior approval of the department director has been obtained, an employee may receive the lunch per diem or use the city charge card. However, the charge must not exceed the lunch GSA per diem amount.
For each full day of travel, all three (3) meals are reimbursable. Per diems for the first and last day travel are governed as set forth below.
EXPAND
Departure Day Reimbursable Meals
Depart before 12:00 noon Lunch and dinner
Depart after 12:00 noon Dinner
  EXPAND
Return Day Reimbursable Meals
Return before 12:00 noon Breakfast
Return between 12:00 noon & 7:00 p.m. Breakfast and lunch
Return after 7:00 p.m. Breakfast, lunch and dinner
The return time of 7:00 p.m. includes only direct travel time and shall not include time taken to stop for dinner.
  (c)
Required meal deductions. Any meal included in a conference or registration fee will not be reimbursed, and the employee shall be required to deduct the applicable meal rate from any reimbursement request. Required meal deductions include those provided by hotels, meetings, conferences or any other source. If a meal is offered as part of a conference and the employee has medical restrictions, dietary or religious convictions that restrict or prohibit consumption, the employee should make every effort to have the conference facilitate their needs. If the request is not honored, the employee is not required to deduct the applicable allowance amount from the per diem. However, the employee must include a note or other documentation with the per diem request to document this exception.
(d)
High cost areas. All out-of-state travel should be pre-approved through the budget process. The GSA rates apply to most locations in the continental United States. All exceptions must be authorized/approved by the city manager and must follow the GSA approved per diem rate on the website referenced above for such area of travel. Examples to be considered for higher per diem rates include areas such as Washington, D.C., San Francisco, New York, Boston and Chicago. The purpose of the trip, duration of stay, individual representing the city, and reason for attendance may also be valid factors for exceptions to the standard GSA approved per diem rate. The employee traveling is responsible for requesting the per diem increase ahead of time.
(e)
Spouse and dependent attendance. Within budget, the city encourages employees to attend functions that are in the best interest of the city. Spousal and dependent attendance can at times enhance the image of the city and is usually encouraged. However, the city cannot expend any public funds for the cost of spouse or dependent attendance while employees are attending meetings, conferences, training, conventions or other city sponsored functions. Therefore, spousal attendance is a personal expense.
(1)
Prepayments. Where possible, known expenses for spousal or dependent attendance should be paid by the employee in advance of any function so that the city may include the payments with the initial registration. These expenses may include, but are not limited to:
a.
Registration fees;
b.
Travel cost; and
c.
Specific function costs, e.g. dinners, socials, sporting functions, etc.
(2)
Follow-up expenses. All final expenses for spousal or dependent attendance which were not paid prior to the function must be paid to the city within five (5) days of returning from the function. These typically include:
a.
Any expenses incurred by a spouse or dependent and charged to the lodging bill;
b.
Any unexpected travel cost charged to the city and not paid in advance; and
c.
Any extraneous expenses incurred by a spouse or dependent while on the trip.
(f)
Accommodations.
(1)
Outside of fifty-mile radius. The city will pay for overnight lodging expenses outside of the fifty-mile radius of the employee's regular work location or residence for training and conferences. This reimbursement is separate from the per diem detailed above. Accommodations should be in or as close to the conference center as possible. The following procedures are required:
a.
Employees are required to submit all room receipts. If staying at the convention headquarters hotel, charges are expected to be reasonable and within the range of similar accommodations in the immediate area visited. Employees should ask for and take advantage of special rates offered to convention attendees. If accommodations are not available at the convention headquarters hotel, the city will pay the prevailing rate at an alternate hotel recommended by the convention officials, not to exceed the rate of the headquarters hotel.
b.
The city is exempt from certain taxes when traveling on behalf of the city and staying in a hotel within the State of Georgia. Employees are responsible for ensuring the hotel/motel tax exemption form and state tax exemption form are presented upon arrival at the hotel. The city will not reimburse for any tax that should have been exempted but for the employee's failure to follow this procedure.
c.
Employees must check out a city credit card before leaving for a trip and present it at check-in for each overnight in-state trip, as required in order to receive tax exemptions. It is the responsibility of the employee to ensure that all tax exemptions are secured. The city will not reimburse for any tax that should have been exempted but for the employee's failure to follow this procedure. Further, only pre-approved, budgeted expenditures may be charged to the city's credit card.
(2)
Within fifty-mile radius. The city will not pay or reimburse for overnight lodging expenses within a fifty-mile radius of the employee's regular work location or residence, unless pre-approved through the budget process or by the department director where an employee may have early morning or late night meetings. Prior approval should be obtained in advance of registration to stay at a convention hotel within the fifty-mile radius. As an exception, the city will pay for overnight lodging expenses within a fifty-mile radius when a city strategic planning conference is held and the city directly pays for the lodging. In such situation, mileage may be reimbursed for strategic conferences, using city hall as the beginning point, since reimbursement policies normally do not allow mileage for getting to a place of work.
(g)
Unique expenses. Occasionally, while on overnight city business, unexpected events arise that are necessary to support the trip. An example of such would be a business meal. Such a function consists of a working meal where a city employee and another individual (or individuals) meet, dine and make decisions concerning issues beneficial to the city. If a business meal occurs while on per diem, a receipt must be turned in to support the claim for additional reimbursement or the charge to the city credit card. It is a judgment call on the employee's part to determine the necessity and worth of the expenditure. Whenever possible, an employee should obtain pre-approval from their immediate supervisor prior to the event. If not pre-approved, and the supervisor subsequently disagrees with the necessity, the employee will not be reimbursed. In such event, the city will be held harmless and [the] employee will remain totally responsible for the full amount of the meal.
(h)
Reimbursements. Proper documentation is always required for expenses to be reimbursed by the city. Items for proper documentation include, but are not limited to, receipts, meeting agenda, outline of meals by day and meal, and detailed explanations for items that are not ordinary in nature. Documentation and payments with respect to lodging, travel, and the credit card charges are managed by the city clerk's office. Only pre-approved or budgeted items may be charged to the city's credit card. Absolutely no other charges to the city's credit card are permitted.
(1)
All proper documentation must be attached to an expense report form before submittal to the department director for approval. The city clerk's office will review the reimbursement request and supporting documentation for any irregularities. If irregularities exist, the city clerk's office will address the issue immediately. If extenuating circumstances exist, each such situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
(2)
To support reimbursement claims and/or extra expenses following out-of-town events, an expense reimbursement report must be submitted, along with all necessary receipts, within five (5) business days after returning from a trip. Employees may only be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred while carrying out their official duties. Any unusual but necessary expenses incurred will be paid only after a written explanation is attached to the travel voucher and approved by all appropriate personnel.
(i)
Exclusions.
(1)
The city will not pay for any movies, entertainment or similar expenses while an employee is traveling.
(2)
The city will not pay any fees for sports activities associated with tournaments, etc., regardless of whether such activities are a part of the conference agenda. If the employee wishes to participate, the employee must pay the cost to do so.
(j)
Transportation and travel reimbursement. Approved modes of transportation include vehicle, air, rail, taxi and public transportation. The method selected by the employee shall be what is the most economically feasible, taking into consideration the value of time. Employees are required to utilize city vehicles when available and practical, unless approval for the use of a personal vehicle or some other form of transportation is obtained from a supervisor prior to the trip.
(1)
Mileage. Miles traveled in personal vehicles will be reimbursed at the rate established by the Internal Revenue Service guidelines. Medical mileage shall also be reimbursed in accordance with IRS guidelines. All personal vehicle mileage must be substantiated using an internet driving map site, such a MapQuest, Rand McNally, Google Maps, etc. Mileage will be paid from the employees place of work or from the actual point of departure, whichever is less. Reimbursement requests should include the purpose of the trip. Reimbursement requests without the proper documentation will be returned to the requestor for further explanation prior to payment. Under no circumstances should the employee use the city credit or fuel charge card to put gas in their personal vehicle.
(2)
Rental cars. Expenses associated with rental cars, i.e. rental expense and fuel will be paid at cost, with receipts provided. Employees shall rent mid-size or smaller vehicles, or an appropriate vehicle size based upon the number of employees needing transportation. Expenses associated with exceeding this car class will be the responsibility of the employee. Employees should decline additional insurance coverage offered by rental car companies as the city's insurance covers car rentals.
(3)
Air/rail. Transportation provided by major airlines or railroads shall be paid at cost to the employee. Travel will be limited to coach/economy class service. In the event the employee chooses a class higher than coach/economy such as business or first class, the difference in expense shall be the responsibility of the employee.
(4)
Taxi/shuttle. Expenses associated with local transportation will be deemed eligible expenses as long as receipts are provided with point to point explanations for such mode of transportation.
