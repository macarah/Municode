DIVISION 6. - VACANT, FORECLOSED, AND DELINQUENT PROPERTY REGISTRATION SYSTEM

Sec. 5-283. - Title.
This division shall be known as the "Duluth Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance."
(Ord. of 9-10-12)
Sec. 5-284. - Findings and intent.
(a)
The purpose of this division is to establish minimum requirements and standards for registration of vacant, foreclosed and/or delinquent property in order to promote and protect the public health, safety, convenience, order and general welfare of the citizens of the city.
(b)
The council finds that:
(1)
There is a need to establish a registration system for vacant, foreclosed and delinquent property in order to protect property values for all property owners and to encourage proper upkeep and maintenance of such properties.
(2)
Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of vacant, foreclosed and delinquent properties, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted.
(3)
Improperly maintained and secured properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of neighboring properties.
(4)
Difficulties often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of vacant, foreclosed and delinquent property. This registration system will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting the party responsible for bringing the property into compliance with applicable provisions of state and local laws and regulations.
