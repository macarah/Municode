Food establishment requirements.
(1)
All food establishments that discharge to the POTW shall provide a grease trap or interceptor as indicated below. Additionally, the director may require any user who generates a wastewater which contains greater than 200 mg/l FOG to install a grease trap.
(2)
All grease traps and interceptors shall be emptied of all material, including solids and liquids, each time these are serviced. Partial pumping, including skimming, is strictly prohibited. All grease traps and interceptors shall be serviced as specified in this section. All grease traps and interceptors shall be serviced by a state licensed hauler and a completed manifest shall be kept on site by the user for every service event. All grease waste shall be taken to a licensed and approved disposal facility for disposal and in no manner shall any grease trap or interceptor contents be discharged by a hauler to the county collection system, either sewer or stormwater. Any violation may result in full prosecution under all applicable state and local laws and ordinances on the first offense.
(3)
All facilities installed by any user pursuant to this division shall comply with all other city or county ordinances and with all building codes that may be enforced in the city from time to time.
(c)
Penalties on noncompliant food establishments.
(1)
Violations. Violating any provision of this section for a total of three violations within 18 months shall be punishable by a fine for each successive violation not to exceed $1,000.00. Additionally, any user violating any provision of this division may be liable to pay restitution in the discretion of the court for:
a.
The total cost incurred by the city or county to repair or replace facilities damaged as a result of the violation.
b.
Any injury or damage to person or property or loss of services resulting from the violation.
(2)
FOG surcharges. Any user discharging greater than 200 mg/l FOG as measured by any grab sample is subject to a high-strength surcharge in addition to other enforcement and penalties.
(3)
Abnormal occurrences. If, in the judgment of the director, a user is causing or may cause water pollution to such an extent as to be or become dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare, the director may require such corrective measures as may be necessary for the protection of the public on an emergency basis, and shall have the power and authority to cause all operation of the user to cease until appropriate corrective measures have been taken by issuing an order to the owner or operator thereof directing the cessation of the operation, or by ordering the utility providing water service to the user to cease providing such service.
(d)
Grease trap regulations for new food establishments.
(1)
Grease trap requirements. All food establishments discharging wastewater containing FOG to the POTW shall install, operate, and maintain at their own expense a sufficiently sized grease trap necessary to achieve and maintain compliance as indicated below. Installation and maintenance shall conform to the current DWRSSS.
a.
Outdoor grease traps. New food establishments shall have a grease trap as outlined in the DWRSSS. A size variance may be issued in an extreme case but shall be verified and documented by inspection. The size variance shall conform to DWRSSS size variance guidelines and is subject to approval by the director. All scullery sinks, mop sinks, floor drains, dishwashers, hub drains and open receptacles shall drain into the outside grease trap.
b.
Outdoor grease trap design. Outdoor grease trap design and installation shall conform to the DWRSSS. The trap shall be located for easy access for user cleaning, pump-out, and official inspection. Dishwasher and food grinder wastewater should be discharged through a suitably sized solids interceptor prior to the emptying into the outdoor grease trap.
c.
Indoor grease traps. All indoor grease trap design and installation shall conform to the DWRSSS. All scullery sinks shall discharge into an indoor grease trap.
d.
Mechanical grease traps. Mechanically operated grease traps (Big Dipper, skimmers, etc.) may not be used by any user tied to the POTW collection system.
e.
Prohibited discharge. It is prohibited to discharge the following materials into an indoor grease trap:
1.
Wastewater with a temperature higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
2.
Acid or caustic trap cleaners.
3.
Any discharge from a dishwasher without approval from the director.
f.
Sampling point. To allow for observation, sampling, and measurement of wastewaters, a sampling point on the effluent discharge side of the grease trap, as required by the DWRSSS, shall be provided at the user's expense. The sampling point shall be maintained and kept safe and accessible to the city and county at all times.
(2)
Variances. All users connected to the county sewage collection system shall install a minimum 1,500-gallon exterior grease interceptor. Variances may be granted if, in the opinion of the director, a limited amount of FOG will be discharged by the user during all aspects of their operation. If a variance is granted, a minimum of a 100-pound grease trap shall be installed along with an effluent test point that meets the testing requirements of the county grease program. If at any time the user exceeds the county discharge limit, the user may be required to upgrade to a minimum of a 1,500-gallon outdoor interceptor at the user's expense. A variance will not be granted if a dishwasher, grill, range top, fryers, or griddle is present, or if the food establishment processes meat. The user may also be subject to any fines or penalties associated with the illegal discharge at the discretion of the director.
(e)
Grease trap regulations for existing food establishments.
(1)
Upgrade. If a food establishment in existence prior to codification of the ordinance from which this division is derived has no grease trap or, as documented by inspection, it is determined that the current grease trap is insufficient for the volume of food service waste being treated, the director may require that the establishment upgrade to an adequately sized grease trap and sampling point as outlined in this section.
(2)
FOG best management practices (FOG BMPs). In order to enhance the overall efficiency of the grease trap, food establishments should implement FOG BMPs to reduce FOG and solids loading to their grease trap. Examples of FOG BMPs are:
a.
Scraping food from pots, pans, plates and utensils into a garbage can;
b.
Installation of a solid waste interceptor;
c.
Pre-washing plates by spraying them off with cold water over a small mesh catch basin positioned over a drain. The catch basin should be cleaned into a garbage can as needed; and
d.
Pouring all liquid grease and oil from pots and pans into a waste grease bucket stored at the pot-washing sink. Heavy solids buildup of oil and grease on pots and pans should be scraped off into the waste grease bucket.
(f)
Grease trap maintenance. All grease traps shall be maintained by the owner so as to be in continuously efficient operation. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents by a properly licensed waste hauler. Top skimming, decanting or back flushing of the grease trap or its waste is prohibited. Further, the discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids into a grease trap from vehicles after servicing is prohibited. Vehicles capable of separating water from grease shall not discharge separated water into the grease trap or into the wastewater collection system. Cleaning and maintenance of all grease traps shall include removal of materials from the tank walls, baffles, cross pipes, inlets and outlets, both tee's and the cover. Recyclable fats, oils and greases shall not be discharged into the POTW. Any violation in the removal of grease waste shall result in prosecution under state law. Maintenance shall be performed at frequencies as required by subsections (f)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
Outdoor grease interceptor. Maintenance shall be performed at intervals of not less than once every 90 days and as required by the 30-percent rule, as follows: The depth of both bottom solids and oil/grease in a trap shall not equal or be greater than 30 percent of the total operating depth of the trap; the operating depth of a trap is the internal depth from the inlet or outlet water elevation to the bottom of the trap. Any solids interceptor should be emptied and cleaned daily. Outdoor grease interceptors shall have a minimum of 1,500-gallon capacity.
(2)
Indoor grease trap. Maintenance shall be performed at intervals not less than once every 30 days. A variance is required to operate an indoor grease trap in place of a 1,500-gallon minimum outdoor interceptor. Indoor grease traps shall have a minimum of 100 pound capacity. Any current user connected to the county sewage collection system that currently operates an indoor grease trap, regardless of size, shall prove, to the satisfaction of the director, that they are not discharging illegally or the user shall be required to upgrade to a 1,500-gallon minimum outdoor grease interceptor. Users may not operate indoor grease traps with a capacity less than 100 pounds. A solids interceptor tied to an indoor grease trap should be emptied and cleaned daily.
(3)
Pumping variance. Variances may be granted if the user can prove, at their expense, to the director's satisfaction, that the discharge from the user's grease trap or interceptor is meeting the county's discharge limit up to 180 consecutive days for outdoor grease interceptors or 120 consecutive days for indoor grease traps.
(4)
Additives. It is specifically prohibited to use any additive, such as enzymes, chemicals, or bacteria, as a substitute for grease trap maintenance. The direct addition of such additives to a grease trap is also prohibited.
(5)
Waste removal. The user shall be responsible for the proper removal and legal disposal of the grease trap waste. All waste removed from each grease trap shall be tracked by an approved three-part manifest and the contents shall be disposed of at a facility permitted to receive such waste. In no manner shall any grease trap contents be discharged to the city or the county sewer or stormwater systems.
(6)
Manifest transmittal. The user shall maintain a legible copy of the completed three-part manifest on site for each service event. Failure to provide all manifests for review by the county grease inspectors may result in a fine at the discretion of the director.
(g)
Recordkeeping by user. It shall be a violation of this division for a user to allow the removal of their grease trap waste without documentation by an approved three-part manifest. The user shall be responsible for maintaining a copy of these manifests on site for a period of three years and subject to the director's review without prior notification. The manifest shall contain the information listed below:
(1)
Food service establishment.
a.
Facility name, address, and telephone number.
b.

Inspection. Inspection of a grease trap shall be performed according to the "30 percent rule," as defined herein.
(2)
Failed inspection. If a grease trap fails the initial inspection, the inspector may notify the user that the grease trap shall be cleaned out within seven calendar days. After seven calendar days, the grease trap should be re-inspected.
(3)
Failed reinspection. If at the first re-inspection, the grease trap is found to still be in non-compliance, a notice of violation may be issued and the user may be told that the grease trap shall be cleaned immediately. After three weekdays, the grease trap may be re-inspected.
(4)
Mechanical grease traps. Mechanically operated grease traps may not be used by any user tied to the county collection system.
(i)
Notice of FOG Violation by DWR.
(1)
Issue FOG NOV. As outlined in this division, whenever the director discovers a violation of any provision of this division, a written NOV may be issued to the user. If satisfactory remedy has occurred within the time frame specified in the NOV, the requirement for a written explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention by the user may be waived by the director.
(2)
Disregard of FOG NOV. If a user served with a NOV fails to initiate/complete corrective action within the time frame specified within the NOV, the director may pursue one or more of the following options:
a.
Have the grease trap pumped and place the appropriate charge on the user's monthly water and sewer bill.
b.
Terminate water and sewer service to the establishment.
c.
File an appropriate action in the courts to compel compliance.
d.
Any combination of the above enforcement actions.
