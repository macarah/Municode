ARTICLE VII. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 18-200. - Short title, authority and applicability.
(a)
This article shall be known and cited as the Peachtree Corners Stormwater Utility Ordinance.
(b)
The City of Peachtree Corners is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III, and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management service systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Peachtree Corners (hereinafter "the city" or "Peachtree Corners") and to collect fees for provision of those services.
(Ord. No. 2017-11-107, § I, 12-19-2017)
Sec. 18-201. - Findings.
The Mayor and City Council of Peachtree Corners, Georgia makes the following findings:
(1)
Stormwater management services as well as stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare and the environment. Provision of stormwater management services, stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of the use thereof renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the city and to all parcels, parcel owners, citizens and the environment in a variety of ways although those benefits may be indirect or immeasurable.
(2)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater management collection and disposal services. A stormwater system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater services provides services to all properties within the city limits.
(3)
The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act and the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") Phase II Stormwater Permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater service fee charge upon improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4, or receive stormwater services from the city, either directly or indirectly, whether or not the property is private or public in nature.
(4)
Peachtree Corners presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater management systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management of other public utilities in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program's operating needs and capital program.
(5)
Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities are needed throughout the corporate limits of the city because many of those areas are developed. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the unincorporated area of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(6)
The provision of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities in the city promotes an essential regulatory purpose by influencing where stormwater runoff flows and how it is managed, thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water pollution caused by stormwater runoff.
(7)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services provided by the city's stormwater management program and the demand imposed by improved property on the city's drainage system and stormwater management program.
(8)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned stormwater program assessment and financial analysis, it is appropriate that the city authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of storm water management services, systems, and facilities within the city in concert with other water resources management programs. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater service fee charge upon all improved/developed properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(9)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners and/or tenants of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management systems and facilities which result in services to such properties and the owners and/or tenants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the stormwater service fee charge correlates to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city stormwater management program.
(10)
A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city. The imposition of a stormwater service fee charge is the most equitable means to allocate the costs to users of the stormwater management services and to generate revenue to implement the defined level of service for the city's stormwater management program.
(11)
The presence and amount of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the stormwater runoff contribution of that property; the corresponding demand the property imposes on the stormwater management program; and the cost of providing stormwater management services to that property by the city. Therefore, the amount of impervious surface on each property is the most significant parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service fee charge; and the city deems it appropriate to impose a stormwater service fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public drainage system whether the property is private or public in nature.
(12)
A schedule of stormwater utility service fee charges based primarily on the amount of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility service fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the service fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts.
(13)
Stormwater utility service fee charges may be supplemented by other funding which addresses specific needs, including, but not limited to, special district service fees, general fund allocations, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(14)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the service fee charge on that property in the form of a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the effect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property.
(15)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Peachtree Corners hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility, as the best available means of addressing the foregoing stormwater management program needs and priorities. By means of this article, the city will enact a stormwater service fee rate structure and a procedure for the establishment of a service fee charge billing rate related to the provision of stormwater management services.

For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the existence and/or installation of 100 square feet or less of impervious surface.
(Ord. No. 2017-11-107, § I, 12-19-2017)
Sec. 18-203. - Establishment of a stormwater utility.
(a)
There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the City of Peachtree Corners Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management systems and facilities and stormwater management program services.
(b)
The city shall establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund within the city accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding generated by the stormwater utility service fee charge to the operation of the stormwater management program and stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the mayor and city council from time to time, and other funds that may be allocated to the stormwater utility.
(c)
All revenues and receipts generated from the storm water service fee charges shall be segregated and placed into the stormwater utility enterprise fund to be held in trust, and be expended solely for stormwater management purposes; provided, however, such fund may also pay a reasonable allocation of costs provided to the stormwater utility by the city's general fund, or other utilities of the city, in order to account for applicable overhead costs. Stormwater utility service fee charge revenue shall be used only for the operating expenses and/or capital investments of the stormwater utility. However, other forms of revenue and/or financial resources, not accounted for in the stormwater utility service fee revenue, may be allocated as deemed appropriate by the city, to provide supplemental funding to the stormwater management program and stormwater management services.
(d)
It is required that the revenue proceeds from all service fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes.

Sec. 18-206. - Rates of stormwater service fees to be established.
(a)
In order to recover the cost of providing stormwater services and stormwater management systems/facilities while fairly and reasonably apportioning the costs among developed properties throughout the corporate limits of the city, the mayor and city council shall establish by adoption of the city's annual fee schedule a stormwater service fee rate, which shall apply uniformly throughout the stormwater utility service area encompassing the corporate limits of the city pursuant to the jurisdiction granted by this article.
(b)
The billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city council from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Peachtree Corners Stormwater Utility. At a minimum, the mayor and city council shall increase the service fee rate by no less than the consumer price index (CPI) on an annual basis. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the Peachtree Corners Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(c)
The area of impervious surfaces on each parcel shall be calculated as of the date of the most recent aerial photography available to the stormwater utility. However, the city manager or his/her designee is authorized to make adjustments to the impervious area calculations as necessary to address the stormwater utility operational needs.
(Ord. No. 2017-11-107, § I, 12-19-2017)

Sec. 18-208. - Stormwater service fee exemptions.
(a)
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no developed public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater service fee charges. The stormwater utility service fee charge is not a tax and no exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management program services and facilities.
(b)
Exemptions to the stormwater service fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Parcels which contain 100 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater service fee charges.
(2)
Linear railroad rights-of-way (i.e. tracks, rails, roadbed) outside of the defined yard limits shall be exempt from stormwater service fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by the rail road company associated with rights-of-way and drainage conveyance systems. However, railroad stations, rail yards, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad operations shall not be exempt from stormwater service fee charges.
(3)
City of Peachtree Corners streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater service fee charges and the stormwater utility shall not charge the city a service fee charge for the city's impervious surface area resulting from the city's impervious surfaces which are owned and/or maintained by the city within the public rights-of-way. This exemption is in consideration of the city allowing the stormwater utility to utilize the city's existing streets, curbs, gutters, drainage ways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and man-made within and owned by the city which controls and diverts surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface and storm waters. All other developed property owned by the city shall be subject to the imposition of stormwater service fee charges in accordance with this article.
(4)
Gwinnett County roads and rights-of-way located within the city limits shall be exempt from stormwater service fee charges in situations where Gwinnett County has legal responsibility to perform all drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities with respect to such roads and rights-of-way. This exemption is in recognition of the drainage system maintenance and capital construction responsibilities undertaken by Gwinnett County. All other developed property owned by Gwinnett County that is within the service area shall be subject to the imposition of stormwater service fee charges in accordance with this article.
(5)
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) roads and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater service fee charges.

Sec. 18-212. - Stormwater service fee adjustments.
(a)
Adjustments.
(1)
The city manager or his/her designee shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater service fee charge.
a.
If a customer believes his stormwater service fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater service fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the city manager or his/her designee on forms provided by the city and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's stormwater utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city, except during the period prior to issuance of the first bill.
b.
Customers requesting an adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate impervious area and other supplemental information to the city manager or his/her designee, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer, unless otherwise allowed by the city. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the city manager or his/her designee, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request.
c.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information has been received, the city manager or his/her designee shall within 30 calendar days render a written decision.
d.
In considering an adjustment request, the city manager or his/her designee shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater service fee charge for the property is correct.
e.
The city manager's (or his/her designee) decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
f.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater service fee charge bill.
