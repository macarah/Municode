ARTICLE VII. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 18-200. - Short title, authority and applicability.
(a)
This article shall be known and cited as the Peachtree Corners Stormwater Utility Ordinance.
(b)
The City of Peachtree Corners is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III, and O.C.G.A. ยง 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management service systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Peachtree Corners (hereinafter "the city" or "Peachtree Corners") and to collect fees for provision of those services.
(Ord. No. 2017-11-107, ยง I, 12-19-2017)
Sec. 18-201. - Findings.
The Mayor and City Council of Peachtree Corners, Georgia makes the following findings:
(1)
Stormwater management services as well as stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare and the environment. Provision of stormwater management services, stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of the use thereof renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the city and to all parcels, parcel owners, citizens and the environment in a variety of ways although those benefits may be indirect or immeasurable.
(2)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater management collection and disposal services. A stormwater system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater services provides services to all properties within the city limits.
(3)
The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act and the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") Phase II Stormwater Permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater service fee charge upon improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4, or receive stormwater services from the city, either directly or indirectly, whether or not the property is private or public in nature.
(4)
Peachtree Corners presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater management systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management of other public utilities in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program's operating needs and capital program.
(5)
Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities are needed throughout the corporate limits of the city because many of those areas are developed. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the unincorporated area of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(6)
The provision of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities in the city promotes an essential regulatory purpose by influencing where stormwater runoff flows and how it is managed, thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water pollution caused by stormwater runoff.
(7)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services provided by the city's stormwater management program and the demand imposed by improved property on the city's drainage system and stormwater management program.
(8)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned stormwater program assessment and financial analysis, it is appropriate that the city authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of storm water management services, systems, and facilities within the city in concert with other water resources management programs. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater service fee charge upon all improved/developed properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(9)
The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners and/or tenants of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management systems and facilities which result in services to such properties and the owners and/or tenants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the stormwater service fee charge correlates to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city stormwater management program.
(10)
A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city. The imposition of a stormwater service fee charge is the most equitable means to allocate the costs to users of the stormwater management services and to generate revenue to implement the defined level of service for the city's stormwater management program.
(11)
The presence and amount of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the stormwater runoff contribution of that property; the corresponding demand the property imposes on the stormwater management program; and the cost of providing stormwater management services to that property by the city. Therefore, the amount of impervious surface on each property is the most significant parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service fee charge; and the city deems it appropriate to impose a stormwater service fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public drainage system whether the property is private or public in nature.
(12)
A schedule of stormwater utility service fee charges based primarily on the amount of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility service fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the service fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts.
(13)
Stormwater utility service fee charges may be supplemented by other funding which addresses specific needs, including, but not limited to, special district service fees, general fund allocations, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(14)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the service fee charge on that property in the form of a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the effect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property.
(15)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Peachtree Corners hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility, as the best available means of addressing the foregoing stormwater management program needs and priorities. By means of this article, the city will enact a stormwater service fee rate structure and a procedure for the establishment of a service fee charge billing rate related to the provision of stormwater management services.

Sec. 18-212. - Stormwater service fee adjustments.
(a)
Adjustments.
(1)
The city manager or his/her designee shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater service fee charge.
a.
If a customer believes his stormwater service fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater service fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the city manager or his/her designee on forms provided by the city and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's stormwater utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city, except during the period prior to issuance of the first bill.
b.
Customers requesting an adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate impervious area and other supplemental information to the city manager or his/her designee, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer, unless otherwise allowed by the city. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the city manager or his/her designee, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request.
c.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information has been received, the city manager or his/her designee shall within 30 calendar days render a written decision.
d.
In considering an adjustment request, the city manager or his/her designee shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater service fee charge for the property is correct.
e.
The city manager's (or his/her designee) decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
f.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater service fee charge bill.
