Sec. 1308A. - C-3 Highway Business District
Purpose.

Permitted Uses. Only the following uses shall be permitted in the C-3 Highway Business District and no structure shall be erected, structurally altered or enlarged for any use other than a use permitted herein with the exception of a) uses lawfully established prior to the effective date of this amendment; b) special uses as permitted herein; or c) accessory uses as defined in Article III, Definitions; or d) other uses which are clearly similar to and consistent with the purpose of this district.

Sec. 1316. - CSO Conservation Subdivision Overlay District.
1.
Purposes. The purposes of this overlay district are as follows:
a.
To encourage the development of residential communities, that are density neutral based upon the Comprehensive Plan, designed to preserve and protect environmental resources, scenic vistas, and natural and cultivated landscapes.
b.
To enhance land, water, air and tree resources by minimizing the area of land disturbance, reducing impervious surface, optimizing stream buffers, preserving tree cover and encouraging retention and protection of Conservation Space.
c.

d.
To provide conservation space and pedestrian linkages and wildlife corridors among residential communities and to encourage recreation opportunities.
e.
To preserve significant historical and archeological features.
f.
To preserve and protect contiguous undeveloped areas within the development.
2.

Sec. 1317. - Mixed-Use Overlay (MUO) District.
1.
Purpose. The purpose of the Mixed-Use Overlay District is to promote new mixed-use developments, or the redevelopment of existing properties in a manner that integrates commercial and/or office with residential land uses, promotes pedestrian accessibility among uses, reduces automobile trips, provides a livable environment for project residents, and enhances the value and aesthetics of the surrounding community. MUOs utilize connective streetscapes to promote an environment conducive to human activity through the provision of landscaping, street/shade trees, street furniture and sidewalks to unify and interconnect varying uses.
2.
Applicability. The Mixed-Use Overlay District may only be implemented within specific geographic areas or developed corridors within incorporated City of Peachtree Corners as designated by the City Council.
The MUO District shall be restricted to the redevelopment of existing office, institutional, residential, commercial and/or industrial sites; or to undeveloped or partially developed properties as deemed desirable by the City Council. Mixed-use Overlay sites should be located on major thoroughfare's where infrastructure is available to support such a use.
Existing conditions of zoning which apply to MUO properties shall remain in effect. Where such conditions conflict with any requirement of this Section, the more restrictive requirement shall take precedence. Notwithstanding the above, the City Council may modify or dissolve pre-existing conditions of zoning upon official designation of the Overlay District.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, the City Council may require the Concept Plan to be submitted to the City Council for review and approval. Such requirement for the City Council review shall be established at the time the Overlay District is designated.
4.
Density, Building Height, and Minimum Project Size. Residential density shall be based upon gross project acreage, and may be developed up to a maximum of 32 units per acre. Maximum building height shall be governed by the underlying zoning district. The City Council may reduce maximum project density and/or establish increased building heights on a case-by-case basis at the time an Overlay District is established.
MUO projects shall contain a minimum of ten (10) contiguous acres of land area; except that expansion of an existing or approved MUO project may contain less land area. Residential uses may occupy no more than 70 percent of the gross site acreage (exclusive of required common area).
5.
