Chapter 54 - SIGNS[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2016-02-70, adopted Feb. 28, 2016, repealed the former ch. 54, §§ 54-1—54-23, and enacted a new ch. 54 as set out herein. The former ch. 54 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of July 1, 2012, §§ 86-100—86-121; Ord. No. 2012-07-62, §§ 1—22, adopted July 24, 2012; Ord. No. 2014-07-29, § 2, adopted Aug. 19, 2014.

Sec. 54-1. - Findings and purpose.
The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard, a detriment to property values, to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly located entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners. Holiday decorations, such as strings of light, are not signs, but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this chapter. By enacting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the city council intends to:
(1)
Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and others within the city;
(3)
Reduce traffic hazards, pedestrian hazards, and other hazards;
(4)
Promote and maintain the aesthetic qualities of the city;
(5)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(6)
Promote economic development;
(7)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
