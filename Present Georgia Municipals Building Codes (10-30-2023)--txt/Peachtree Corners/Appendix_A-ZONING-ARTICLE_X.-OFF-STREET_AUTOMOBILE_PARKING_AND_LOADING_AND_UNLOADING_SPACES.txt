(Ord. No. 2016-02-69, Exh. A, 2-28-2016)
Sec. 1001. - Plan and Design Standards for Off-Street Parking.
The following are required plan and design standards for off-street parking.
1.
Required area for each parking space.
a.
Each automobile space shall be 9 feet wide and 18 feet deep as measured from face-of-curb, or 9.5 feet wide and 18.5 feet deep as measured from back-of-curb.
b.
Up to 15 percent of the overall parking spaces provided for a non-residential development may be in the form of compact spaces. Compact parking spaces shall be 8 feet in width and 16 feet in depth, as measured from face of curb, or 8.5 feet wide and 16.5 feet deep as measured from back-of-curb, and shall be clearly marked as compact spaces.
2.
Interior driveways.
a.
Interior driveways shall connect each parking space with a public right-of-way.
b.
Inter-parcel driveway connection or provision of a future inter-parcel driveway stub (with appropriate cross-access easements) shall be required between adjacent non-residential properties. This requirement may be waived by the Director of Planning and Development, only if it is demonstrated that an inter-parcel connection is not feasible, due to traffic safety or topographic concerns.
c.
Interior driveways with no parking shall be 10 to 12 feet for on-way traffic, and 20 to 22 feet for two-way traffic. One-way driveways that are determined to be essential access for fire safety shall be increased to 14 feet.
Interior driveways shall be at least 22 to 24 feet in wide when used with 90-degree angle parking. Interior driveways shall be 10 to 12 feet wide (one-way), and 20 to 22 feet wide (two-way) when used with 60-degree angle parking.
d.
Interior driveways providing primary access to loading/unloading zones or loading docks for truck traffic may be increased to 14 feet in width per travel lane. Adjustments to geometry may be granted, if it can be shown with turn-radius templates that modifications to the standards are required.
e.
Interior driveways surrounding gasoline pump canopies may be increased to 40 feet in total width (as measured from the base of the gasoline pump islands).
f.
A separate driveway and stacking lane (accommodating at least 2 vehicles per lane) is required for any drive-up window, bank drive-through or pick-up station. These stacking lanes shall be separate and distinct from the required through-lane providing circulation around the building.
3.
Improvement of Off-Street Parking Lots. All off-street parking lots shall meet the following standards:
a.
They shall be graded to ensure proper drainage, installed on a minimum 4-inch gravel aggregate base with a minimum 2-inch asphalt topping or other approved surface of, concrete, porous concrete, or porous asphalt. An approved porous concrete, porous asphalt or grassed paving system shall be used for surplus parking. Grassed paving spaces shall be located on the perimeter edge of a parking lot.
b.
Each parking space, except for grassed paving systems, shall be clearly marked by a painted stripe no less than three (3) inches wide running the length of each of the longer sides of the space or by curbing or by other acceptable method which clearly marks and delineates the parking space within the parking lot.
c.
Non-residential parking lots containing 200 spaces or more shall incorporate pedestrian access corridors into their design.
i)
Pedestrian corridors shall include 4-foot wide sidewalks with 2-foot grassed strips along at least one (1) side of primary driveways. The pedestrian corridors shall connect parking areas directly with buildings and adjacent public streets. These corridors shall not apply to auto sales lots.
ii)
Where pedestrian corridors cross a driveway, they may be constructed as a raised, flat hump with a height of 4 inches and a 6-foot wide top with 4-foot wide ramps and marked as a crosswalk; or may be constructed with an approved contrasting paver and marked as a crosswalk.
iii)
Parking spaces shall not be located more than 200 feet from any pedestrian corridor.
4.
Maintenance and Appearance of Parking Lots. Parking lots shall be maintained in good condition, free of potholes, weeds, dust, trash and debris. Porous paving and grass paving systems shall be maintained to function as designed.
5.
Location and Surface of Parking Areas.
a.
In any non-residential district, the parking of any vehicle on other than a paved surface (or approved porous or grassed paving system) is prohibited.
b.
In any residential district, the parking of any motor vehicle except on a hard-surfaced driveway or in a carport or garage is prohibited. Any recreational vehicle or any non-motor vehicle may only be parked in a carport, enclosed structure, or in the rear yard on a paved surface (or approved porous or grassed paving system). Exception to this restriction shall be made for visiting campers and motorhomes which may be parked up to four times per year in the same residential driveway for up to seven (7) days at a time. Any vehicles parked in the rear yard not in a carport or an enclosed structure must be parked at least fifteen (15) feet from the property line. Vehicles or equipment used for agricultural purposes on RA-200 or R-100 zoned property with 5 or more acres are exempt from hard surface parking requirements if parked outside the required front yard setback.
Maximum allowable paved parking or hard surface area in front yards. (Excluding walkways and required sidewalks.)
A.
R-ZT District - Not more than 45 percent.
B.
All other residential districts, excluding R-TH district - Not more than 35 percent.
C.
In the R-TH zoning district, driveways for adjoining units shall be separated by at least a 4-foot wide grassed strip, unless the units are villa-type with connecting driveways.
