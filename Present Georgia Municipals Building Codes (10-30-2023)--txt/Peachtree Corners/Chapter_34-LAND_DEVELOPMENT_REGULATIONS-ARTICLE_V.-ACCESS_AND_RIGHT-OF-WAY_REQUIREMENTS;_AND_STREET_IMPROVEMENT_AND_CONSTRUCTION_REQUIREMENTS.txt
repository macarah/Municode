A dead-end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision where necessary to provide access to a land-locked abutting property, for planned continuity of future circulation, for improved access for public safety vehicles, or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring lands. Such dead-end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the director, provided the directors of the departments of public safety and public utilities concur.
(2)
Dead-end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the director in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may conflict between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection.
(3)
Where a dead-end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat.

Half-streets. Half-streets (new boundary streets having one-half of the minimum required right-of-way or pavement width) shall not be allowed nor access to same be permitted should it exist.
(g)
Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the city under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the city attorney or acceptable to the director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties.
(h)
Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the director of the need for same. In the event the director approves a design which proposes alleys, the alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street pursuant to the standards contained in these regulations.
(i)
Street jogs.
(1)
Street jogs shall either directly align or have offsets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential subdivision streets and a minimum of 200 feet for nonresidential subdivision streets, as measured between centerlines of said streets.

a.
Residential subdivision projects. Sidewalks shall be installed on new internal streets (both sides, including "eyebrow" turnarounds) and on abutting external streets (abutting side). Sidewalks are not required adjacent to cul-de-sac turnarounds nor on streets ending in a cul-de-sac turnaround that provide access to six or fewer lots. Sidewalks may end at the radius transition of a cul-de-sac turnaround with an L-shaped "mid-block" curb ramp in alignment with the ramp on the opposite side of the street.
1.
Residential subdivision developer responsibility. Developers shall install sidewalks on abutting external streets, "passive" recreation area lots, and open space lots, and shall install intersection radius curb ramps at new street intersections, and L-shaped mid-block ramps at cul-de-sac turnarounds, within 60 days of approval of the final plat. Sidewalks on "active" recreation area lots shall be installed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or shall be installed by the developer prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety, whichever is earlier. Developers shall also install sidewalks on any vacant lots remaining between developed lots (i.e., dwellings under construction or completed) prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety.
2.
Homebuilder responsibility. Homebuilders shall install sidewalks, and curb ramps not required to be installed by developers, on building lots prior to release of the certificate of occupancy for a home.
b.
Nonresidential subdivision projects. Sidewalks shall be installed on new internal streets (both sides, including cul-de-sac and "eyebrow" turnarounds) and on abutting external streets (abutting side) within 60 days of approval of the final plat.
c.
Non-subdivision projects. Sidewalks shall be installed on abutting streets (abutting side) prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
d.
Maintenance surety. Maintenance surety provided to the city shall include the cost of sidewalk construction in an amount acceptable to the city.
e.
Escrow alternative. The cost of sidewalk installation may be set aside in escrow with the department of transportation if proposed road improvements by the city may impact the location of a sidewalk.
f.
Pursuant to a finding by the public works director that a sidewalk at a specific location would not provide a public benefit, funds may be contributed to the sidewalk bank in lieu of the sidewalk construction.
(2)
Sidewalk design and construction standards. Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section. The director is authorized to grant modifications upon specific application due to topographic or drainage difficulty as well as alternative design proposals after receiving a recommendation from the department of transportation.
a.
Width. Sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide on new internal subdivision streets, except sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide on new internal streets or drives within the Senior Oriented Residence District (R-SR). Sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide on abutting external streets.
