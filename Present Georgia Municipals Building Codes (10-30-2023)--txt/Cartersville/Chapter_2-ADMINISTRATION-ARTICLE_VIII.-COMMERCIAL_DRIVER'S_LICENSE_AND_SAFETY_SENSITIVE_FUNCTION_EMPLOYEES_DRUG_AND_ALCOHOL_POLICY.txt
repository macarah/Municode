ARTICLE VIII. - COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SAFETY SENSITIVE FUNCTION EMPLOYEES DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY[11]

Footnotes:
--- (11) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, adopted November 17, 2005, repealed the former Art. VIII, §§ 2-231—2-244, and enacted a new Art. VIII as set out herein. The former Art. VIII pertained to alcohol and drug use by commercial drivers and derived from Ord. No. 16-99, § 3(Exh. C), 2-18-99; Ord. No. 36-01, § 8, 9-6-01.

Sec. 2-231. - General policy.
Continued research and practical experience have established that even small quantities of alcohol and drugs can impair reflexes and judgment. This impairment, even when not readily apparent, can have catastrophic results, particularly for employees operating vehicles, potentially dangerous equipment, or using weapons. Unlawful drug use, including the abuse of prescription medication is also incompatible with the responsibility of City of Cartersville employees with commercial driver's license to obey the law, especially those employees who are involved in drug interdiction. To comply with the guidelines of the department of transportation in regard to operators of vehicles/equipment requiring commercial driver's licenses and other reasons, we have adopted a policy that all employees must report to work completely free from the presence of alcohol or unlawful drugs, or habit-forming drugs with whose legitimate usage constitutes a threat to safety.

Sec. 2-234. - Prohibitions of alcohol and drug use.
(a)
Alcohol use. Employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (.04) or greater. Employees with an alcohol concentration of .04 or greater will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive functions. An employee whose test results indicate an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, but less than four hundredths (.04), will not be allowed to perform safety-sensitive functions until the start of the employees next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than twenty-four (24) hours following the alcohol test.
Employees are prohibited from possessing or using alcohol while on duty. Employees are prohibited from performing safety-sensitive functions within four (4) hours after using alcohol. Following an accident, employees are prohibited from using alcohol for eight (8) hours or until undergoing a post-accident test.
Misuse of alcohol is grounds for discharge from the city.
(b)
Drug use. Employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions when the employee uses drugs, unless the use is due to a physician's instruction who has advised the employee that the substance does not adversely affect the employee's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The employee must inform the employer of any such therapeutic drug use. If tested positive for drugs, employees are prohibited from reporting for duty, remaining on duty, or performing a safety function. A positive test fro use of controlled substances is grounds for discharge from the city.
(c)
Refusal of test. Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test has the same consequences as a positive test result. If an employee fails to provide an adequate testing sample without a valid medical explanation or engages in conduct that obstructs the testing process, that employee will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-235. - Types of testing.
(a)
Pre-employment testing. An employee applicant whom the city intends to hire or use shall be tested for the use of drugs, but not alcohol, as a condition of qualifications for employment. A drug test is also required whenever a current employee moves into a safety-sensitive position. No employee shall perform any safety-sensitive functions until a pre-employment test has indicated a verified negative result.
(b)
Post-accident testing. When testing is required:
(1)
The accident involved a fatality; or
(2)
The driver receives a citation under the state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from an accident.
a.
Injury requiring medical treatment away from the scene; or
b.
One (1) or more vehicles incurring disabling damage* and having to be towed from the scene.
*"Disabling damage" is damage which prevents a motor vehicle from leaving the scene of the accident in its usual manner, in daylight, after simple repairs. This includes a motor vehicle that could be driven but would be damaged further if driven.
It does not include:
• Damage that can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the accident without special tools or parts.
• Tire disablement without other damage, even if no spare tire is available.
• Headlight or tail light damage.
• Damage to turn signals, horn, or windshield wipers which make them inoperative.
If an alcohol test is not performed within two (2) hours of the accident, the city will prepare and maintain on file a record stating why the test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test has not been conducted within eight (8) hours of the accident, no test will be conducted and the city will maintain the same record. If a drug test has not been administered within twelve (12) hours of the accident, no test will be administered and the city will maintain on file a statement of the reasons the test was not promptly administered.
If an employee subject to post-accident testing does not remain readily available for such testing, he or she will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. However, an employee is allowed to get necessary emergency medical attention for injured people, or, if necessary, to leave the scene of an accident for the period necessary emergency medical care. The employee is responsible for ensuring that he or she complies with this section of the city's drug and alcohol testing program.
(c)
Random testing. All CDL drivers and safety sensitive employees are subject to unannounced drug and alcohol testing. A random computer selection process will be used to select employees to be tested. Each employee will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. At least fifty (50) percent of all employees subject to testing will be tested each year for drug use. At least ten (10) percent of all employees subject to testing will be tested each year for alcohol use. The dates of testing will be spread reasonable throughout the calendar year. When supervisors are notified of selection of employees they are to proceed to testing site immediately with the employee. Do not let employee eat or drink or le them out of eyesight.
Employees will be tested for alcohol use while performing safety-sensitive functions, just before performing safety-sensitive functions, or just after performing such functions.
(d)
Reasonable suspicion testing. An employee shall submit to testing whenever the city has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee is using a prohibited drug or is using alcohol in a prohibited manner. A decision to test will be made based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. "Reasonable suspicion:" means that the city believes that the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee are indicative of the use of drugs or alcohol. A reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use will be made by a supervisor or, when possible two (2) supervisors. A reasonable suspicion of alcohol misuse can only be made during, or just before or after, that period of the workday when the employee is engaged in the performance of a safety-sensitive function. After observation of suspect conduct, the employee should be transported immediately to a testing site.
The mere possession of alcohol does not constitute a need for reasonable suspicion testing, which must be based on observations concerning the driver's appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor.
Once behavioral, speech, and performance indicators show an employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, the employee must not report for, or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. An employee will only be permitted to resume performance after an alcohol test shows the employee's alcohol concentration at less than two hundredths (.02) or twenty-four (24) hours have elapsed following the determination of reasonable suspicion. If an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours following the supervisor's observation, a statement of the reasons for delay must be prepared and maintained on file. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight (8) hours, the employee will not be tested and a statement of the reasons for failure to administer the test will be prepared and maintained on file.
Within twenty-four (24) hours of the observations being made or before the results of the drug test are released, whichever is earlier, documentation of the suspicion must be prepared and signed by the supervisor, or company official who made the observations.
(e)
Return to duty testing. Any employee who has engaged in prohibited drug or alcohol use must undergo a drug or alcohol test before returning to duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. A drug test must indicate a verified negative result for drug use. An alcohol test must indicate an alcohol concentration of less than two hundredths (.02).
(f)
Follow-up testing. An employee who returns to duty after a positive test is subject to follow-up testing. If a substance abuse professional determines that an employee needs help in resolving drug or alcohol abuse problems, follow-up drug and alcohol testing will be administered as directed by that substance abuse professional. At least six (6) tests are required in the first twelve (12) months from the date of the employee's return to duty. Follow-up testing will not exceed sixty (60) months from the date of the employee's return to duty. After the first six (6) tests, an employee may be released from the requirement of follow-up testing if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-236. - Drug testing procedures.
Drug testing procedure will be in accordance with the DOT's drug testing procedures at 49 C.F.R. § 40. Employer must notify the driver that the test is required under the regulations (49 CFR Part 40) before performing a drug test. Notice can be oral or written. Use of the "Controlled Substance Custody and Control Form" may serve as the required notice. The test will be performed using any approved DOT test method. The employee will be tested for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP). Upon notification that a drug test is required, an employee must report immediately to a drug collection site. Unreasonable delay in reporting to a site after notification will be deemed a refusal to submit to testing.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-237. - Alcohol testing procedures.
Alcohol testing procedures will be in accordance with the DOT's alcohol testing procedures at 49 C.F.R. § 40. The test will be performed using breath or saliva samples. Upon notification that an alcohol test is required an employee must report immediately for alcohol testing and provide a breath or saliva specimen. If an employee fails to report to a testing facility in a reasonable time, that employee will be deemed to have refused to submit to alcohol testing. If the result of the initial test is an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, a confirmation test will be performed. For the purposes of this policy, alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohol including methyl and isopropyl alcohol in any beverage, mixture, or preparation, including any medication.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-238. - Supervisory training.
The city has established an education and training component for supervisory personnel who are authorized to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to require an employee to undergo reasonable suspicion testing under this policy. Every such supervisor shall receive at least two (2) hours of training on the specific indicators of probable drug or alcohol abuse. One (1) hour will cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and one (1) hour on the use of controlled substances.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-239. - Record keeping.
The city shall ensure that the following records are kept for a period of at least five (5) years; all records of positive drug results and alcohol test results indicating an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, documentation of refusal to take tests, calibration documentation, driver evaluation and referrals, and a copy of all annual calendar year summaries of the results of the city's drug and alcohol testing programs. Records related to the alcohol and drug collection process and training will be kept for a period of at least two (2) years. Records relating to negative and cancelled drug test results and alcohol test results with a concentration of less than two hundredths (.02) will be kept for one (1) year.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-240. - Notification of test results.
The city shall notify an employee of the results of any drug or alcohol test if the results of any drug or alcohol test if the results were positive. The employee will also be advised what drug was discovered. In addition, the city shall notify an employee applicant of the results of a pre-employment drug test provided that the employee applicant requests such results within six (6) days of being notified of the disposition of the employment application.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-241. - Access to facilities and records.
The city will not release employee information that is contained in drug or alcohol programs records except as required by law or expressly authorized by the employee. An employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of drugs or alcohol, including any test records. In addition, federal, state, and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release an employee's records to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by an employee, upon receipt of a written request from the employee. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information expressly authorized by the employee. The city may also provide information to an employee or decision maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the employee which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceeding may pertain, for example, to worker's compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the employee.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-242. - Release of test information by previous employers.
Within fourteen (14) days of the first time an employee performs a safety sensitive function for the city, the city is required by law to obtain information from an employee's previous employer on the employee's positive drug test results, alcohol test results of four hundredths (.04) or greater and refusals to be tested for drugs or alcohol within the preceding two (2) years. This information must be obtained with the consent of the employee. Other information relating to an employee's drug and alcohol use may be obtained, pursuant to the employee's consent, by the city. Any such request must be accompanied by the employee's written authorization for release of the information. Refusal to consent to release of this information by the employee has the same consequences as a positive test result.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-243. - Referral, evaluation, and treatment.
Any employee, except for any employee applicant who tests positive for drug use or alcohol misuse will be advised of the resources available to the employee in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and use of drugs including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs. The city will bear the cost of providing this referral information.
In order for an employee who has tested positive for drug use or alcohol misuse to return to a position requiring the performance of a safety sensitive function, that employee must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional who will determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and drug use. Any employee identified as needing assistance in resolving such problems must successfully complete any rehabilitation program that is prescribed by a substance abuse professional before performing a safety sensitive function. Follow up testing will be conducted under the supervision of the substance abuse professional. Evaluation, assistance, rehabilitation, and follow up testing will be obtained, if at all, at the cost of the employee.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-244. - Penalties.
In addition to any discipline or discharge by the city, employees with commercial driver's licenses who violate federal regulations regarding drug and alcohol testing could be liable for penalties ranging from five hundred dollars ($500.00) to two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) and/or criminal penalties with a maximum fine of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or imprisonment for up to ninety (90) days, or both.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-245. - Review and appeal.
Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within ten (10) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have chain of custody procedures to ensure proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing.
(Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05)
Sec. 2-246. - Alcohol testing.
Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests.
§ 40.241 What are the first steps in any alcohol screening test?
As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using:
a)
When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test.
b)
Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin alcohol testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving.
1.
If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins.
2.
If the employee needs medical attention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test.
c)
Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, State, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact DER to verify the identity of the employee.
d)
If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, address, or telephone number.
e)
Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF.
f)
Complete Step 1 of the ATF.
g)
Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the "Remarks" line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test.
Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests.
§ 40.25 What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using a saliva ASD or a breath tube ASD?
a)
As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the saliva ASD:
1.
Check the expiration date on the device or package containing the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after the expiration date.
2.
Open the individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee.
3.
Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer.
4.
If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases which a new test is necessary because the device did not activate (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section), you must insert the device into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. You must wear single-use examination or similar gloves while doing so and change them following each test.
5.
When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding necessary next steps in ensuring that the device has activated.
6.
(i)
If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section (e.g., the device breaks, you drop the device on the floor), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new device.
(ii)
The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employee before the test.
(iii)
You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.)
(iv)
You must offer the employee the choice of using the device or having you use it unless the employee, in the opinion of the STT or BAT, was responsible (e.g., the employee dropped the device) for the new test needing to be conducted.
(v)
If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section on the new test, you must end the collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF.
(vi)
You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using an EBT for the screening test.
7.
If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3)—(a)(5) of this section, but the device does not activate, you must discard the device and conduct a new test, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. In this case, you must place the device into the employee's mouth to collect saliva for the new test.
8.
You must read the result displayed on the device no sooner than the device's manufacturer instructs. In all cases the result displayed must be read within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. You must then show the device and it's reading to the employee and enter the result on the ATF.
9.
You must never re-use devices, swabs, gloves or other materials used in saliva testing.
10.
You must note the fact that you used a saliva ASD in Step 3 of the ATF.
(b)
As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the breath tube ASD:
1.
Check the expiration date on the device or on the package containing the device and show it to the employee. You must not use the device after its expiration date.
2.
Remove a device from the package and break the tube's ampule in the presence of the employee.
3.
Secure an inflation bag onto the appropriate end of the device, as directed by the manufacturer on the device's instructions.
4.
Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee chooses to use (e.g., hold) the device, instruct the employee to blow forcefully and steadily into the blowing end of device until the inflation bag fills with air (approximately twelve (12) seconds).
5.
If the employee chooses not to hold the device, you must hold it and provide the use instructions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
6.
When the employee completes the breath process, take the device from the employee (or if you were holding it, remove it from the employee's mouth); remove the inflation bag; and either hold the device or place it on a clean flat surface while waiting for the reading to appear.
7.
(i)
If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section (e.g., the device breaks apart, the employee did not fill the inflation bag), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new one.
(ii)
The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employer before the test.
(iii)
You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.)
(iv)
You must offer the employee the choice of holding the device or having you hold it unless the employee, in your opinion, was responsible (e.g., the employee failed to fill the inflation bag) for the new test needing to be conducted.
(v)
If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section on the new test, you must end collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF.
