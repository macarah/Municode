(Ord. No. 36-19, § 1, 9-19-19)
Sec. 7.5-284. - Permitted encroachments.
(a)
Driveways. Driveways (including paved, masonry, asphalt, etc.) are permitted to encroach on the right-of-way. A driveway permit shall be required and the lot owner shall secure permission for any new driveway from the public works department. Driveways must meet sight distance requirements of the public works department, and must be constructed in compliance with city requirements for stormwater drainage/piping.
(b)
Landscaping. Limited landscaping is permitted in the city right-of-way, including grass, flowers and shrubs not in excess of two (2) feet in height. Trees shall not be planted in the right-of-way. Irrigation systems shall not be installed in the right-of-way.
(c)
Mailbox support structures. The city permits limited encroachment of the right-of-way for mailbox support structures, which meet the following standards:
(1)
The use of massive mailbox support structures that, when struck, could damage vehicles and cause serious injury to vehicle occupants are prohibited. Heavy metal posts, concrete posts, brick bases, and miscellaneous items such as farm equipment or supports filled with concrete are also prohibited and cannot be used for mailbox supports.
(2)
Acceptable mailbox supports include: (a) a single four-inch by four-inch or four-inch diameter wooden post; (b) a metal post with strength no greater than a two-inch diameter standard strength steel hollow pipe; or (c) other support of no greater strength, as approved by the street department, as in accordance with the standards of the AASHTO Streetway Design Guidelines for mailbox structures, which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event the property owner has any question as to whether the proposed mailbox support will be permitted, the public works department should be consulted.
(3)
Mailbox supports must be embedded no more than twenty-four (24) inches into the ground. A metal post shall not be fitted with an anchor plate, but it may have an anti-twist device that extends no more than ten (10) inches below the ground surface.
(4)
Mailboxes. The post-to-box attachment details should be of sufficient strength to prevent the box from separating from the post top if a vehicle strikes the installation. The mailbox itself should be of lightweight steel, wood, or plastic/composite construction, and meeting U.S. Postal Service regulations.
(d)
Driveways. New driveways for single family residences tying into existing the city streets must receive a driveway permit from the public works department prior to constructing a driveway. The applicant shall submit information on a form issued by the public works department regarding the location, proposed size and construction, and other relevant information. New driveways on commercial or industrial or other non-residential developments shall be approved through the permit process for the engineering department. If a new commercial or industrial or other non-residential development is of a type that does not require engineering department approval, the applicant shall still require a driveway permit prior to construction.
(e)
Utility work. The city permits utilities to encroach in the right-of-way subject to the terms of the City of Cartersville Utility Accommodation Ordinance and Wireless Facilities and Antennas Ordinance. Such work shall require issuance of surety to secure performance of the work and a warranty and maintenance period, as stated in that ordinance.
(f)
Projects tying into the city rights-of-way. New developments that tie into existing city street rights-of-way are permitted, with the permission of the public works department. Approval is given as a part of the approval process through the engineering department under the development regulations. If any new construction or development requires tying into a city street but does not require a land disturbance permit or any development approval from the engineering department, the applicant must submit plans to the public works department prior to beginning construction and secure a permit. In all cases, surety shall be required as stated in subsection (h) below; no work shall be permitted in a city right-of-way without a surety.
(g)
Permitted improvement of existing city streets. In certain circumstances, a developer or other party may be permitted or required to improve city streets. In such circumstances, the plans typically shall be approved through the engineering department and a surety posted in accordance with the development regulations for work in an existing city right-of-way. The amount of the surety shall be sufficient to pay for the project, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls. In the event the development does not require approval through the engineering department, a permit shall be secured through the public works department. In all cases where work is performed in a city right-of-way, surety shall be required as stated in subsection (h) below; no work shall be permitted in a city right-of-way without a surety.
(h)
Surety to city. Prior to issuance of an approval to work in a city right-of-way, except as otherwise approved under the utility accommodation ordinance, wireless facilities and antennas ordinance, or franchise agreement, the party seeking to perform the work shall cause to be executed in favor of City of Cartersville surety in the form of a performance and maintenance bond, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, or an escrow deposit. The surety must be accepted and approved by the public works department before any permit can issue. In the event the work in the right-of-way is related to a development approved through the engineering department, the surety requirements of the City of Cartersville Development Regulations (which are essentially identical to the requirements below) shall control, and the surety shall be administered by the city engineer. However, if the project is not approved through the engineering department, the surety requirements below shall apply, and the surety shall be administered by the public works department.
(1)
Purpose. The purpose of the surety shall be the following:
a.
To ensure proper construction of any work performed in existing city rights-of-way (whether street improvement, tying into an existing right-of-way or other purpose);
b.
To provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period applicable to any work in any existing city right-of-way.
(2)
Approval. The surety shall only be issued in a form approved by the city. The language of the surety and the term of the surety must be approved by the city prior to issuance. The city has forms it prefers that surety companies use, and those can be provided upon request; otherwise, the form of the surety shall be approved by the public works department prior to acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or surety bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with the current International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publications governing such letters of credit, and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch in the city, which shall be the place of tender of the draft on said letter of credit. The city reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety from an applicant that has tendered unsatisfactory surety in the past. The city reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past. Escrow shall mean deposit of good funds in a bank of the city's choosing pursuant to escrow instructions issued by the city.
(3)
Scope. In each case, the surety guarantees that all applicable provisions of any city ordinances are complied with, including but not limited to, the city development regulations, the utility accommodation ordinance, city standard street details, and the regulations promulgated under each of the foregoing.
(4)
Amount and term. The amount of the surety depends on the project, and shall be set by the public works department relying on experience with similar projects and the applicant, knowledge of material and labor costs, and investigation of additional costs. The amount shall be sufficient to secure performance of the work and compliance with the city ordinances and regulations. For work in existing city rights-of-way (whether improving existing streets, tying into existing streets, or other purposes), the amount of surety shall be sufficient to ensure repair the streets after any planned work, including associated utility relocations/installations and stormwater controls, that are part of the project being approved; the minimum twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). The foregoing amount is a minimum and can be increased based on a more complex or expensive project, difficult terrain or other factors that would make the remedial work more expensive. No additional separate amount of surety shall be required for maintenance purposes. The term of any surety shall extend for the period from the issuance of the permit until the project is completed, and additionally beyond that for the duration of the warranty and maintenance period.
(5)
Partial release. Once a project has been inspected and completed, the city may, at the discretion of the public works department, release a portion of the surety amount; the remainder shall be kept as surety for the maintenance period. Once the applicable maintenance period has passed, the remaining surety amount shall be released.
(6)
Prerequisite; calling surety. No permit or approval for work in the right-of-way shall be issued by the public works department until the surety has been furnished to the city, in a form acceptable to the city. If the developer does not comply with these regulations, other applicable city ordinances and regulations, or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the surety, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to perform the work or hire a contractor to remedy the defects, whether that means installing soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures, completing paving and street work, or completing other work.
(7)
Waiver. The public works department shall be authorized, but not required, to reduce or waive the surety requirement for projects undertaken by a municipal government in the city. The surety requirement may also be waived by the department head's discretion, for utilities that have demonstrated a history of compliance with this article, financial responsibility, quality work, and prompt responsiveness.
(i)
Warranty. Any permit holder working in the right-of-way shall provide a two-year warranty for any work conducted under authority of this article. The two-year warranty shall commence upon the completion of the work. The surety shall remain in effect during the warranty period. During the warranty period, the permit holder shall be responsible to repair any defects in the work or repair, or correct any deficiencies that are not up to the standards and regulations of the city ordinances.
