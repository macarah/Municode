Sec. 15-38. - Duties.
(a)
In general. Board members must recognize that their responsibilities are as an "advisory board" only. The board's composition will consist of a varied range of individuals, with a different interest of recreational activities and/or facilities, the input received and recommended will be highly considered by the city council, city manager and the parks and recreation director when determining policies and goals for the department of parks and recreation. Board members must recognize that their job is to advise in determining goals and policies, not to administer them. They do not use their position for political, financial, or personal advantage. They recognize their trusteeship and devote their time needed to learn their job and to carry out their responsibilities. They do not assume the functions of the director by attempting to dictate how details shall be carried out, by interfering with employment procedures, or by dealing directly in an executive capacity with subordinate workers. A sound principle in board executive relationships is to let the director organize, conduct and direct the affairs of the department, as long as his/her efforts produce the desired results deemed appropriate by the city council.
(b)
Guidelines.
(1)
The principal function of the advisory board is to advise and make recommendations to the city council, city manager and director of parks and recreation that helps the City of Cartersville meet the recreational/leisure needs of the citizens.
(2)
No committee or individual board member has any authority unless such authority is specifically granted to him/her by the city council.
(3)
Board members shall deal officially with the recreation staff only through the director.
(4)
The board must be careful not to permit their judgment to be influenced by pressures adverse to the best interests of the parks and recreation department and all citizens of Cartersville. They must always bear in mind that all parks and recreation facilities and programs are to be utilized for and in the best interest of the entire citizenry and not for a select group.
(5)
Board members are guides and counselors. They study the broader phases of operation leaving to the director all administrative details. They should, whenever possible, avail themselves to the director when requested to give counsel or advice in problems concerning the department.
(6)
Board members should always insist upon the maintenance of the highest standards.
(7)
Board members should, when requested to do so, be willing to represent and speak for the department at official occasions. Members are often called upon to act as spokesmen for departments in other cities at public ceremonies, public hearings on problems concerning the department, and conferences at which recreation programs and policies are under discussion.
(8)
The board will be able to make changes, add to or delete from the by-laws and rules and regulations of the advisory board of the parks and recreation department. Any changes must by approved by the city council.
