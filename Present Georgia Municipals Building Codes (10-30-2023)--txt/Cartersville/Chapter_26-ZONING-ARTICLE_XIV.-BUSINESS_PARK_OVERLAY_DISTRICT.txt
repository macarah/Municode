ARTICLE XIV. - BUSINESS PARK OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 14.1. - Purpose.
The purpose of the Business Park Overlay District is to provide uniform regulations for a joint City of Cartersville-Bartow County industrial/business park, a portion of which is located in each jurisdiction. To provide consistency for property owners and future uses, and to benefit the public health, safety and welfare, the city and county have adopted identical regulations as follows. The Business Park Overlay District, where applied via amendment to the official zoning maps of the participating government, shall control over inconsistent regulations contained in other ordinances and the Code of Ordinances of each jurisdiction, whether or not the provisions herein are stronger or weaker restrictions.
Sec. 14.2. - Boundary map.
The boundaries of the portion of the business park located within the city limits of Cartersville are shown in the boundary map included as Exhibit "B" in Article XXV, which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this article by reference.
Sec. 14.3. - General area, height and setback regulations.
Minimum lot size: One (1) acre.
Maximum lot coverage (impervious surface limitation): Seventy-five (75) percent.
Required lot width at street right-of-way (internal street): Forty (40) feet (twenty-five (25) feet in cul-de-sac).
Front setback: Forty (40) feet.
Side setback: Fifteen (15) feet.
Rear setback: Twenty (20) feet.
Maximum building height (see below): Seventy-five (75) feet.
Buffers (see below): Fifty (50) feet except as noted.
A.
The zoning administrator may grant an administrative variance of up to twenty (20) percent to any of the general area, height and setback regulations listed above. Additionally, he or she may grant an administrative variance on the undisturbed buffer requirements, if the proposed landscaping and screening in the buffer enhances the screening of the adjacent property.
B.
Building height. With the approval of the zoning administrator, maximum height may be increased by variance. Building height limitations shall not apply to accessory structures such as water towers, conveyer belts, smokestacks and other incidental and uninhabited parts of industrial uses.
C.
Buffers. A fifty-foot buffer shall apply adjacent to all land uses, except that no buffers shall be required from industrial to industrial. Further, there shall be a two hundred-foot buffer required where shown on the overlay district map adjacent to existing residential uses as of the date of adoption of the overlay district. When any of the existing residential uses are rezoned to a nonresidential zoning classification, the buffer adjacent to that property shall be reduced to fifty (50) feet, unless it is a similar zoning classification, in which case the buffer requirement shall not apply. Buffers shall be undisturbed, except that, if the buffer is adjacent to a residential use, and is insufficiently dense to be opaque to vision year-round, the zoning administrator may require that the buffer shall be planted with sufficient vegetation so that it is opaque year-round, to a depth of at least twenty-five (25) feet. Buffers may be used for perpendicular crossing by access roads and utilities, but not for lateral roads or parking. Buffers may be used for detention ponds, provided that vegetative screening remains or is planted between the pond and the property line. The zoning administrator shall approve buffer plans and plantings.
D.
Setbacks shall be measured from the property or lot line. As setback exceptions, the following may intrude into the setback zone: unsupported roof overhangs, steps, walkways and access roads, landscaping and irrigation systems, planters, architectural fences and walls not exceeding forty-two (42) inches, and underground utilities and sewers.
