(1)
Dangerous dog. Any dog that:
a.
Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury (see section 5-3); provided, however, that a nip, scratch or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection;
b.
Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury (see section 5-3) to such a person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; or
c.
While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog.

The owner or custodian of the dog has been convicted of a violation of any state criminal law and the crime was related to such dog; or
b.
Any local governmental authority has filed with the court a civil action requesting the euthanasia of the dog.
(5)
Previously classified animals. Any dog classified prior to November 1, 2012, as a potentially dangerous dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a dangerous dog. Any dog classified prior to November 1, 2012 as a dangerous dog or vicious dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a vicious dog under this chapter. The owner of any dog classified prior to November 1, 2012 shall come into compliance with all current provisions of this chapter by November 1, 2012.
(b)
Confiscation. If an animal control officer has reason to believe that a dog has acted in a manner that justifies a classification as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the dog may be confiscated, impounded, classified, and notice provided as set forth below. A law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall immediately impound a dog if the officer believes the dog poses a threat to the public safety.
(c)
Exceptions. An animal shall not be classified within the meaning of this section if it inflicts injury upon a person when the animal is being used by a law enforcement officer or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties.

(k)
Judicial review. Judicial review of the animal control officer's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-13-19, except that venue shall be limited to the Bartow County Superior Court.
