(i)
Traffic calming: A term used by transportation professionals to refer to reducing traffic speeds.
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14)
Sec. 12-103. - Requirements for study.
(a)
The following criteria must be met before a particular residential street(s) is studied for possible speed table installation:
(1)
Local, residential street. The City of Cartersville must confirm that the requested streets are classified as local, residential streets with a maximum posted speed limit of thirty (30) mph, or below. In addition, the requested street(s) must be suitable for speed table installation: streets must be a minimum of one thousand (1,000) feet in length, and at least one thousand (1,000) feet of each street must have grades ten (10) percent or less and horizontal curves less severe than a radius of three hundred (300) feet.
(2)
A request (in writing). The City of Cartersville must receive a written request from a resident (or residents) of a particular residential street(s) asking that their street(s) be studied to determine if any qualify for the installation of speed tables. The address of the resident making such request will be verified using the same procedures used for rezoning requests.
(b)
Residential streets meeting the above criteria are added to the City of Cartersville list as a speed table study area for study purposes.
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14)
Sec. 12-104. - Validate speed and volume requirements.
Upon authorization by city council, a speed table request will be evaluated based upon the following study criteria. The following requirements have been established in determining if streets qualify for study regarding the possible installation of speed tables:
Traffic data will be collected from selected residential street to determine the 85th percentile speed and the ADT. If the 85th percentile speed is ten (10) mph or more over the posted speed limit, and the ADT is between three hundred (300) and three thousand (3,000) vehicles, the residential street qualifies for a public meeting.
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14)
Sec. 12-105. - Public meeting.
(a)
For all study areas that meet the previous requirements, a public meeting shall be held at which a representative of the public works department shall be present and take minutes for presentation to city council. Public meetings are held in order to provide speed table study area residents with relevant information prior to city council public hearings/readings.
(b)
Prior to public meetings, public works shall mark the proposed speed table location(s) on the residential street(s) within three (3) feet of the final location(s) and shall subsequently verify that the resident(s) of property fronting the speed table location(s) agree with the proposed location(s). In the event that no suitable speed table location(s) can be agreed upon by public works and the resident(s) fronting the location(s), the matter will be brought forward to council for consideration prior to further action.
(c)
Notices of the public meetings will be posted a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to each meeting. Signs advertising the public meeting(s) will be provided and installed by the City of Cartersville Public Works Department. Signs will be clearly legible to traffic traveling in each direction near each end of the road section being considered for speed tables. Public meetings consist of a short presentation, followed by a question and comment session. The purpose of the public meeting is to provide reasonable accommodation for input from residents and others that may use the residential street(s) to access their lots.
(d)
Emergency service providers (police, fire and ambulance) will be requested to provide information to the council related to the effects of installing speed tables in the requested study area.
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14)
Sec. 12-106. - Public hearing before city council.
(a)
A public hearing shall be held to determine whether speed tables shall be installed on a residential street. Notice of public hearings shall follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. Public hearings before the council will be conducted only for those locations that qualify for consideration under this policy. After the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove installation of speed tables in the study. Said approval shall be handled as an ordinance amendment.
(b)
Emergency service providers (police, fire and ambulance) will be requested to provide information to the council related to the effects of installing speed tables in the requested study area.
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14)
Sec. 12-107. - Speed table design standards.
The geometric design of speed tables is a crucial factor in their effectiveness. City of Cartersville speed tables will be constructed per the following specifications:
(1)
Vertical height. Three (3) inches. A tolerance for minor height differences due to construction variations may be permitted.
(2)
Horizontal length. Twenty-two (22) feet (consisting of an incline of six (6) feet; a plateau of ten (10) feet in length; and a decline of six (6) feet).
(3)
Spacing/placement. In order to be effective, speed tables are typically installed in a series. Spacing between tables will vary between a minimum spacing of three hundred (300) feet and a maximum spacing of eight hundred (800) feet or as recommended by public works. Minor changes in the proposed speed table location up to three (3) feet may be considering prior to installation of the speed tables based upon resident concerns and the engineering feasibility to make such modifications.
(4)
Signs/pavement markings. Speed tables will be identified in accordance with signing and pavement marking standards in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition. In cases where special safety circumstances exist, public works may authorize signing and pavement marking exceeding the minimum standards set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14)
Sec. 12-108. - Installation of speed tables.
The property owners requesting the permanent traffic control devices will be responsible for the costs of the measures. Installation of speed tables will be performed by either a private contractor, contracted by the City of Cartersville, or by city forces. Installation of speed tables will not be considered final until the City of Cartersville Public Works Department inspects the tables for compliance with design standards set forth in this article. Under certain circumstances or extreme hardships, the cost may be funded by the city if funds are available.
(Ord. No. 22-14, § 1, 7-1-14)
Sec. 12-109. - Repeated requests.
In the case where a request fails because of failing to meet the required criteria or lack of affirmative vote by city, that street(s) must wait a minimum of two (2) years from the start date of the original request in order to make a subsequent request, unless special circumstances have had a noticeable effect on the study criteria outlined in this policy.

This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the City of Cartersville in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction.

By regulating such operation, the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the City of Cartersville has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on roads, sidewalks, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any State of Georgia law or this chapter as a condition of operating motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on the roads of the City of Cartersville.
