Sec. 7.5-264. - Provisions for the protection of the public.
(a)
Safety procedures; securing work site. The use of the right-of-way shall be minimized to the greatest possible extent. No materials or equipment shall be stored on the right-of-way without prior written approval. No work shall restrict the sight distances for motorist exiting adjacent streets or driveways unless a flagman is provided. Minimum distances of lane closures to protect the safety of the work crews and the general public shall be provided by the city public works department. Closure of lanes and traffic flow, and other relevant safety measures, shall be conducted in accordance with the current edition of the Uniform Manual on Traffic Control Devices, latest edition, as well as the DOT Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards manual, latest edition. Debris shall not be placed on the right-of-way, but will be hauled away as the excavation occurs. All trenches opened each day must be backfilled and compacted to ninety-five (95) percent standard proctor using appropriate tamping or vibratory equipment unless otherwise approved by the department. The department reserves the right to require compaction testing from the utility, at the utility's expense, for any work involving cutting, trenching, or backfilling in the roadbed. Any postings must be properly posted and maintained so they are legible. All work areas must be secured at the end of each workday to protect the general public.

(b)
Indemnification. The utility receiving the permit and the contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless City of Cartersville, the department and all city employees, and agents, from any and all liability resulting from any work performed under the permit or with written notification in a city right-of-way, as provided in the current edition of the state DOT's Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards. The utility shall also indemnify the City of Cartersville from any claims, suits or causes of action resulting from any work under the permit or pursuant to written notification. These terms shall become terms of and contained within the permit/permit application and/or special assurances form(s). Such indemnification shall include the costs of attorneys' fees and litigation expenses to enforce this indemnification provision.
(c)
Warranty. The utility shall provide a one-year warranty for any work conducted under authority of this article including any new installation and any repair work. The one-year warranty shall commence upon the completion of the work. The warranty shall be supported by a surety in the case of a utility permit, or by the utility owner in the case of actions requiring written notification. The utility shall be responsible to repair any defects in the work or repair, or correct any deficiencies that are not up to the standards and regulations of the city ordinances.
(d)
Surety. Surety shall be required for work under this article, as specified herein, to ensure performance of the repair in compliance with the standards and regulations of the city and specifically to ensure that roads are repaired properly. Surety shall be in the nature of a performance and maintenance bond, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, or an escrow deposit.
(1)
Form. The surety shall only be issued in a form approved by the city. The language of the surety and the term of the surety must be approved by the city prior to issuance. The city has forms it prefers that surety companies use, and those can be provided upon request; otherwise, the form of the surety shall be approved by the city prior to acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or surety bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to do business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with the current International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publications governing such letters of credit, and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch in city, which shall be the place of tender of the draft on said letter of credit. The city reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety from a developer that has tendered unsatisfactory surety in the past. The city reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past. Escrow shall mean deposit of good funds in a bank of city's choosing pursuant to escrow instructions issued by city.
(2)
Amount. Surety shall be in an amount determined by the city public works department based on the size of the project. The minimum surety for a utility permit shall be twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). The department may use its discretion when setting the amount of the bond and should consider potential damage to public property or facilities and the relationship to the cost of installation, as well as the factors used in determining whether a project is complex.
(3)
Prerequisite; calling surety. No permit shall be issued by the City of Cartersville Public Works Department until the surety has been furnished to the city, in a form acceptable to the city. If the developer does not comply with these regulations, other applicable city ordinances and regulations, or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the surety, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to perform the work or hire a contractor to remedy the defects, whether that means installing soil erosion and sedimentation prevention measures, completing paving and road work, or completing other work.
(4)
Waiver. The city public works department shall be authorized, but not required, to reduce or waive the surety requirement for projects undertaken by Bartow County in the city. The surety requirement may also be waived by the department head's discretion, for utilities that have demonstrated a history of compliance with this article, financial responsibility, quality work, and prompt responsiveness.
(e)
Insurance. All utilities operating in city right-of-ways shall also provide proof of liability insurance in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) in general liability coverage that shall also cover the actions of the contracts and subcontractors. In lieu of the foregoing, the utility may self-insure for the above-referenced coverages. The utility shall present valid proof of self-insurance upon the department's request.

The utility and any and all contractors or subcontractors shall be held liable for any violations of this article. The permit shall be posted at the site at all times, and a copy of the permit shall also be kept available at all times on the job site when any work is underway.
(d)
Inspection. The department reserves the right to inspect the work during such periods as the department's field inspector(s) deem necessary to check compliance with the terms of the permit, and to require the utility and/or contractor to correct all deviations from the approved permit, or any safety concerns the inspector may have. If the utility and/or contractor do not correct the deviations, the permit can be revoked and a violation cited.
(e)
Notice of defect. If a utility installation or road repair is found by the city public works department not to be in compliance with the specifications provided, or otherwise not in compliance with this article or the permit, the city public works department shall notify the utility immediately by written notice of defect. The utility will then have forty-eight (48) hours to make the necessary repairs or other work, unless longer time is granted by the department. If the necessary work is not completed within the time limit specified, then the city public works department may make the repairs or conduct the necessary work, and charge the utility for the costs of the materials and labor. The utility will also be in violation of this article for failing to abide by the notice of defect. The department in such circumstances would be authorized to issue citations, stop-work orders, or seek other relief. In the case of emergencies, the department shall give the utility 24-hour contact one (1) hour to respond, and if no action is begun to correct the emergency, shall be authorized to repair the deficiency itself. In such cases, the utility shall be responsible for the costs of labor and materials for the emergency repair. In the event city incurs costs to correct a defect of a utility company, the city shall be authorized to withhold all further permits (or issue a stop-work order) until the costs incurred by the city are paid.
(f)
Violations and penalties. Violations of this article, or the procedures adopted under this article, shall subject the responsible parties to citation in city municipal court. Action may also be taken in superior court to recover fines and also to obtain injunctive relief to cure defects, or for other necessary action. The city attorney or other designated attorney for the department may initiate such actions. Citations shall be served personally on any responsible party at the site of the utility work, and shall be served on the utility through its designated contact in the city, as indicated on the permit. Each day a violation exists shall be a separate violation.
(1)
Responsible parties.

(g)
Stop-work orders. The department is authorized to issue stop-work orders in the event of a violation of this article. In the case of a threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or other harm to the city's property, such orders may be issued without prior issuance of a notice of defect. In the case of other violations, a notice of defect shall be issued first, and a stop-work order may be issued if the necessary repair or work is not completed by the time limit specified. Stop-work orders shall be issued in writing to any responsible party at the site of the utility work, and shall be served on the utility through its designated contact in the city, as indicated on the permit. Such stop-work orders may be issued only to stop-work at the particular location, or may be broadened to halt all work by that same utility in the city.
