CHAPTER 5. - SIGN REGULATIONS
ARTICLE 1. - FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT

Sec. 1.1. - Findings.
The City of Fort Oglethorpe finds that the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs within the city directly affect the public health, safety and general welfare. The city finds that the signs need to be regulated in order to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of residents and nonresidents alike. The council has determined that signs can detract from the historical and aesthetic beauty of the City of Fort Oglethorpe, which is located adjacent to the Chattanooga-Chickamauga National Battlefield. The council has determined that a nationally recognized historic district is designated within the confines of the City of Fort Oglethorpe. The council has determined that parcels with historical significance are located within the confines of the City of Fort Oglethorpe.

Sec. 1.2. - Statement of legislative purpose.
(a)
The mayor and council recognize that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard, as a detriment to property values, and as an aesthetic nuisance affecting the overall economic growth of Fort Oglethorpe. Numerous professional studies have been prepared that examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and economic prosperity, including the following:

(b)
Based on a review of the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the mayor and council find that unregulated signs:
(1)
Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians;
(2)
Can be a detriment to the public health;
(3)
Can hamper economic growth;
(4)
Can lower property values;
(5)
Can adversely impact public investments;
(6)
Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and
(7)
Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment.

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish standards to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Fort Oglethorpe for the fabrication, erection, use, maintenance and alteration of signs, symbols, billboards, and markings within the city. These standards will provide an avenue for communication needs and allow and encourage creativity, effectiveness, and flexibility in the design and use of signs, symbols, billboards, and markings within the city while promoting health and safety and avoiding an environment that encourages visual blight.
(b)
It is the further purpose of this chapter to prohibit the future erection, placement, or location of portable and certain other types of signs determined to be detrimental to the aesthetic sense, historic character and public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city both generally and as it affects commerce.

(2)
To protect the right to the use of allowed and properly permitted signs for the identification of activities and related products, services, and events and for non-commercial messages;

To enhance and build the economy of the city by promoting the reasonable and effective displays of business and commerce in the city;
(5)
To protect the rights of individuals to privacy and the freedom for nuisances;

(7)
To maintain the use patterns of established zoning districts by allowing aesthetically compatible signs in such areas;
(8)
To maintain and maximize the tree and vegetation coverage in the city;
(9)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the Constitution of the United States of America;
(10)

(12)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances and to create a permitting procedure for such signs;
(13)
To prohibit signs which are not expressly permitted by this chapter, to provide for maintenance of signs, and the enforcement of provisions of this chapter.

Generally.
(1)
The area of a sign face or module shall be computed by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, color, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets other regulations of the city and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
(2)
If a sign face is composed of two or more sign modules, the sign face area shall be the area of each module, measured in accordance with the preceding paragraph (1), totaled together.
(3)
The area of a sign structure shall be computed by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of the sign, by multiplying:
a.
The width of the body of the sign (exclusive of the sign's base or decorative cap, if any) measured at the widest portion of the sign body; times.
b.
The total height of the sign as defined in this article under "sign height."
(4)
The following are examples of how sign structure and sign face area measurements are made; the signs shown are illustrative and only provided for clarity.

(1)
Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the sign face area shall be the total area of both sides.

Signs with three or more faces.
a.
For sign structures having only three sides and the interior angle formed between each of the sides is 60 degrees, the sign face area shall be taken as the area of the largest of the three sides.
b.
For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the sign face area shall be either the largest sign on any one side, or the largest total of all sign faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees, whichever can be viewed from an adjoining street.
(c)
Free-form signs. For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign face.
(d)
Kiosks.
For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be the largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure.
