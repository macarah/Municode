ARTICLE IV. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS

Sec. 34-101. - Purpose
The purpose within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water.
Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge area. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(Ord. No. 2001-12, § 1, 4-9-01)
Sec. 34-102. - Definitions.
[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]
Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-2-87;035. (Note: the DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer of being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge areas.
Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia).
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).
(Ord. No. 2001-12, § 1, 4-9-01)
Sec. 34-103. - Establishment of the groundwater recharge area protection district.
The groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this article.
Determination of pollution susceptibility. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map. Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this article.
