(Ord. of 1-9-2012(1), § D))
Sec. 2-246. - Exemptions.
(a)
The following materials and services are expressly exempted from these procedures:
(1)
Emergency purchases. Emergency purchases are defined as those purchases made necessary by situations which could not be anticipated by a department, usually resulting in work stoppages, involving life threatening circumstances or risks of injury, or undue delay that occurred during non-business hours when the ordinary purchase procedures cannot be followed. Negligence on the part of the department to plan properly is not justification of an emergency purchase. A requisition request stating the nature of the emergency should be requested on the next business day. The requisition, setting forth the details, shall be accompanied by the purchase receipt, charge slip or other documentation.
(2)
Cooperative purchases. Cooperative purchases are those made through a group arrangement that aggregates demand to obtain favorable pricing. Cooperative purchases may be made through either joint solicitation or "piggyback" arrangements, and examples include the United States General Services Administration, the Georgia Department of Administrative Services, the National Cooperative Purchasing Alliance, and the National Intergovernmental Purchasing Alliance (National IPA).
(3)
Banking services. Banking services for Madison County Board of Commissioners as the depository institutions for county funds may be contracted upon by the chairperson and chief finance officer without the necessity of the formal sealed bid process. Banking services for Madison County Board of Commissioners with regard to issuance of credit cards may be contracted upon by the chairperson and county clerk without the necessity of the formal sealed bid process or formal board action.
(4)
Insurance services. Insurance services, including, but not limited to, liability, property and casualty, and worker's compensation coverage, need not be obtained through a formal sealed bid process. Bids for coverage may instead be obtained through one or more licensed brokers, to be selected by the chairperson, using whatever methodology the broker, if enlisted, deems best; the results of the broker's efforts shall be presented to the Madison County Board of Commissioners for decision and action.
(5)
Service agreements. Agreements for maintenance that are part of the original purchase, or are provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment or product, are not subject to competitive solicitation.
(6)
Sole/single source. Purchases from an only known source of supply.
(7)
Utilities and fuel. Because of the fluidity of these markets, quotes may be taken periodically to assure best price and service is obtained.
(8)
Continuations. Continuance of an existing purchase agreement, bid, request for proposal, rental, or lease duly authorized by the board or its agent.
(9)
Professional services. Contracted professional services such as architectural, engineering, consultative or advisory services can be selected from a source identified as providing the expertise and availability on the particular topic at the discretion of the applicable department head.
(10)
Blanket requisitions. Where serial bulk purchases of a commodity item are anticipated, a blanket purchase order may be issued that authorizes multiple purchases from one or more vendors. For example, a blanket fuel purchase order might be issued in the amount of $30,000.00 from which the public works director may make fuel purchases in smaller increments from multiple vendors, depending on the district's needs and the best price obtainable at a given point in time.
(b)
These items shall require an authorization for payment form from the originating department:
(1)
Real property and other related costs of acquisition of real property.
(2)
Purchases between the county and other governments and/or nonprofit organizations.
(3)
Services provided directly to individual citizens and employees, including reimbursements and other miscellaneous payments.

The advertisement shall include notice dates, specifications, location of delivery for bid packets, and contact information.
(b)
Bid packet. A formal sealed bid information packet will be prepared and forwarded to all qualified vendors. The purchasing agent and the user department shall, in consultation with one another, complete a specification bid packet. The specification bid packet shall include, among other items, a complete description, with detailed specifications for the goods or services needed, location of delivery for bid packets, contact information, and legal forms. The county clerk will hold all formal sealed bids until the date and time predetermined for bid opening in the public meeting room and then until a scheduled meeting to present for award to the Madison County Board of Commissioners. A purchase order is required.
(c)
Bid opening. Bids are opened in the public meeting room on the predetermined date and at the predetermined time set by the county clerk and department head. Late bids will not be accepted. All vendors and the general public are invited and encouraged to attend the bid openings. Pending, rejected, or deferred sealed bid amounts will be held until such time as the final award of the contract is made, the project is terminated or abandoned, or there is a vote, whichever comes first.
(d)
Award of bid. When a bid opening is scheduled for a time other than at a meeting of the board of commissioners, the county clerk shall prepare a summary and comparison of all bids submitted, a copy of which shall be provided to each commissioner prior to any scheduled vote on the award of the bid. Bids may be awarded only by vote of the Madison County Board of Commissioners. The county reserves the right to reject any and all bids.

Performance bonds. To protect the interest of the county, a performance bond in the amount of 100 percent of the proposed contract may be required from the successful bidder before entering into the contract. If such bond is not provided within 15 days of the award of such bid, the award shall be void. The contractor shall furnish such other bonds or insurances as may be required by law, the county, or bid specifications. The type of bonds and insurances shall be set forth in the bid specifications.
(g)
Request for bids (RFB). The RFB method will be used when detailed technical specifications can be developed. Examples are road paving, vehicle purchases and certain types of materials.

Request for information (RFI). The RFI method will be a non-binding procurement practice in which a request is made by the purchasing agent for information which may include vendor information on price, best practices, industry standards, technology issues, etc.
(j)
Request for proposal (RFP). The RFP method is a formal request made to obtain offers of price and plans for handling a project. This process is used when the expertise of the bidders will be relied on to develop a solution for the county and price may not be the deciding factor in the bid award. These transactions are subject to the formal sealed bid process and allow for negotiations in certain areas (scope) of the proposal following the bid opening.
(k)
Request for quotation (RFQ). The RFQ method is a request sent to suppliers along with a description of the commodity or services needed and requires a response from the supplier by a predetermined date. Evaluation and recommendation for award should be based on the quotation that best meets price, quality, delivery, service, past performance, and reliability. These transactions may or may not be subject to the formal sealed bid process and further negotiations are usually unnecessary.
