Sec. 46-37. - Duties and powers of the recreation board.
(a)
The recreation board shall be first and foremost a recommending body, in place to assist the Madison County Board of Commissioners and the recreation director in the smooth and effective operation of a countywide recreation program for the citizens of Madison County. The recreation board shall be accountable to the Madison County Board of Commissioners. The recreation board shall:
(1)
Consult with and make recommendations to the Madison County Board of Commissioners and the recreation director regarding the establishment and conduct of recreational programs and activities.

Promote recreational activities that are wholesome and constructive for all the citizens of Madison County.

Recommend short and long term goals of the recreation program.
(9)
Communicate with the public on matters of concern regarding recreation department programming, and relay those concerns with recommendations to the director and/or board of commissioners, as appropriate.
(b)
The recreation department head, referred to herein as the recreation director, retains and bears ultimate power and responsibility over the operation of the recreation department. Final decision on all recreation department matters rests with the director, except as to those matters on which decision-making authority is vested in the board of commissioners, or chairman thereof, by state law, local legislation, or county policy. The director should seek input and recommendation from the recreation board on those matters on which decision-making authority is vested in the board of commissioners or chairman by state law, local legislation, or county policy. The director should seek input and recommendation from the recreation board on those issues, and the recreation board should promptly and cooperatively provide input to the director on those matters, but the recreation director retains final authority over these matters.
(c)
The powers of the recreation board are limited to those stated in these bylaws. By way of clarification and example, but not limitation, the following specific areas over which the recreation board has no authority are noted:
(1)
The recreation board shall not own, possess, or handle funds or property. Persons wishing to make gifts, devises, or bequests of funds or property for recreational purposes shall be referred to the county finance officer.
(2)
The recreation board exercises no authority in the area of employee practices. All personnel decisions, including hiring, termination, and discipline, are vested in the department head, chairman of the board of commissioners, and/or board of commissioners, as set forth in the county personnel policy.
(3)
Direct communication on recreation department issues between members of the recreation board and employees within the recreation department is discouraged. The recreation board should rather serve as a liaison between the recreation director, the board of commissioners, and the citizenry.
(4)
All purchasing, financial, and contract decisions are vested in the board of commissioners, except as the board of commissioners may have lawfully vested in department heads or other county employees pursuant to county policy. The board of commissioners may if it so desires seek input or recommendations from the recreation board on any such decisions.
