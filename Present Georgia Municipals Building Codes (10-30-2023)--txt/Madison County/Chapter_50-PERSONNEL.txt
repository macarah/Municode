(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 1))

(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 2))
Sec. 50-33. - Pay plan.
(a)
Establishment. The board of commissioners shall adopt a pay plan for positions of employment under the jurisdiction of the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners may choose to omit positions from the pay plan (e.g., positions it chooses to fill by individual contracts of employment). By definition, positions omitted from the pay plan are not subject to this policy, unless and to the extent the board of commissioners specifies application of this policy to such position in the contract or other arrangement with the person so employed.
(b)
Amendment. The board of commissioners, in its sole discretion, may amend the pay plan at any time and in any manner, including, but not limited to, creating positions, abolishing positions, altering the job descriptions for positions, and raising or lowering the rates of pay for positions.
(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 3))
Sec. 50-34. - Recruitment and selection for vacant positions.
(a)
Department heads shall be responsible for notifying the human resources manager of vacant or soon to be vacant positions in their departments. The department head and human resources manager shall confer at the earliest opportunity, with board of commissioners chair consent, to determine whether recruitment should be limited to current county employees or open to the public; how postings, advertisements, and notices should be made; and whether a closing date for applications should be specified.
(b)
If the human resources manager and department head wish, and the board of commissioner's chair consents, a position may be filled from review of applications previously submitted, without the necessity of new postings or advertisements. It is anticipated this process would typically be used in situations where an applicant is hired and then leaves employment within 90 days.
(c)
The human resources manager may design application forms, and may require their use in connection with any particular vacancy.
(d)
The department head and human resources manager shall review applications and resumes, conduct interviews, and/or take such other review as they deem appropriate, and recommend one or more candidates to the board of commissioner's chair for approval, and the chair's approval is final. For department head positions, the chair shall select a candidate to recommend for approval by the board of commissioners, and the board's approval shall be final.
(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 4); Ord. of 10-5-2020 ; Ord. of 4-19-2021 ; Res. of 6-27-2022(1) , § 1)

Sec. 50-38. - Supervisory authority; references.
(a)
Scope of authority. Supervisory employees should exercise such authority and discretion as set out in the employee's job description. If a supervisory employee has doubt as to his or her authority to make a decision or take an action, he or she should consult his or her own supervisor for direction. Department heads should consult the chairman of the board of commissioners for direction on questions as to their own scope of authority, and on such inquiries from subordinates when they are unsure as to the proper answer.
(b)
Reference inquiries. All inquiries regarding current or former employees will be responded to by the human resources manager. Any employee who receives such an inquiry shall not give out any information concerning such current or former employee, but rather shall refer the inquirer to the human resources manager.

Sec. 50-39. - Reinstatement and transfers.
(a)

Transfers. Employees transferring to another department will receive a pay rate adjustment to the entry level rate for that position. The employee will retain years of service for reasons of pension and vacation pay. Also, the employee will receive an equity code adjustment for years of service as applied to the new pay rate after three full pay periods in the new position.
(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 9))
Sec. 50-40. - Compensation policy.
(a)
Permanent full-time employment. Employment for a 40-hour workweek, expected to continue indefinitely.
(b)
Permanent part-time employment. Employment for a workweek of less than 40 hours, expected to continue indefinitely. Part-time employees shall be entitled to insurance benefits on a pro-rated basis (e.g., county will pay 50 percent on the amount it pays for full-time employees if employed for 20 hours per week, 100 percent if employed for 30 hours per week, etc.), and shall accrue leave time on a pro-rated basis (e.g., 50 percent if employed for 20 hours per week, 75 percent if employed for 30 hours per week, etc.)
(c)
Temporary employment. Employment on either a full-time or part-time basis indefinitely. Temporary employees shall not be entitled to insurance benefits or paid leave time.
(d)
On call. Employment simply by being placed on an approved list of persons who may be called upon by a department head when additional personnel are needed due to absences, vacations, or other reasons. On-call employees shall not be entitled to insurance benefits or paid leave time. Placement on a call list is no guarantee of being called upon at all or of being called upon for any specific number of hours.
(e)
Hours of work. The department head shall, in his or her discretion, establish the weekend hours of work for employees under his or her supervision, subject to the Fair Labor Standard Act and any other applicable law. For employees in offices located in the county government complex, work hours shall be consistent with the office hours established in the general county policy.
(f)
Workers' compensation. Any employee who is accidentally injured on the job is covered under the Georgia Workers' Compensation Act. An employee may elect to receive his/her accumulated sick, or sick and annual leave in lieu of workers' compensation benefits while he/she is disabled. In the event the available leave is inadequate to cover the entire period of disability (in excess of the first seven days of disability) the employee would be entitled to weekly benefits as of the day his/her leave was exhausted. Alternatively, an employee may opt to receive only the workers' compensation benefits that are authorized by law, which most often will be monetarily less than an individual's normal salary. If an employee has exhausted all sick leave, FMLA leave, and any other leave available to him/her under this personnel policy and is still unable to return to work and perform the essential functions of his/her job (with any reasonable accommodations warranted under the circumstances), he/she will be placed on administrative leave without pay, subject to potential later termination should circumstances so require in the sole discretion of the county.
(g)
Return to work policy. Madison County participates in the Loss Control and Safety Incentive Program of the ACCG Group Self-Insurance Workers' Compensation Fund, through which workers' compensation coverage is provided to county employees. In accordance with the requirements of that program, department heads and elected officials are directed/encouraged to make efforts to return injured workers to employment as soon as reasonable and practicable. In situations where the employee's treating physician has determined that temporary physical limitations do not permit the employee's return to his previous job, such efforts should include providing "transitional employment" (i.e., temporary duties that are less strenuous than the employee's normal job duties) where reasonable and practicable.
(h)
Overtime and compensatory time.
(1)
Definitions. The county will comply with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws governing minimum wages, overtime pay, and child labor. The county determines "exempt" or "non-exempt" of positions in accordance with FLSA guidelines. Questions regarding exempt/non-exempt status should be directed to the human resources manager.
Exempt employees are not subject to the overtime pay provisions of the FLS(a)
Non-exempt employees are subject to the wage and hour provisions. Under the FLSA, most non-exempt employees must be paid:
a.
At least the federal minimum wage, and
b.
FLSA overtime, which consists of time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 [hours] in a standard workweek (except as to fire protection and law enforcement personnel who have a work period of at least seven but fewer than 28 consecutive days, for whom overtime compensation is required when the ratio of the number of hours worked to the number of days in the work period exceeds a specified ratio as set forth in 29 U.S.(c)(a) § 207(k) and 29(c)(f)R. § 55(3)201(a)). Paid leave or holiday time used is not counted as hours worked in determining overtime.
The payment of overtime to non-exempt employees is a legal requirement. Department heads may not tell non-exempt employees that they are ineligible for overtime pay, and any who make such statements may be subject to progressive counseling up to and including termination.
(2)
Overtime/compensatory time. It is the county's intent to schedule work activities during the standard 40-hour workweek. However, in order to meet customer and business needs, it may be necessary for non-exempt employees to work in excess of those hours. When this is necessary, department heads will provide as much notice as possible to the employees required to work.
Authorization to work in excess of the standard 40-hour workweek must be obtained in advance from the department head. Employees who work in excess of 40 hours in a standard workweek without prior authorization may be subject to progressive counseling up to and including termination of employment.
(3)
Compensatory time maximums. Employees engaged in public safety or emergency response may not accrue more than 480 hours of compensatory time. Since compensatory time is accumulated at time and one-half, this is 320 hours of actual overtime work (320 hours of overtime work × 1.5 = 480 hours). All other non-exempt employees may not accrue more than 240 hours of compensatory time (160 hours of overtime work × 1.5 = 240 hours). If a non-exempt employee's compensatory time balance exceeds the accumulation limits of 240 or 480 hours, the employee must be paid for any hours over the limit at time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay.
(4)
Conditions of use of compensatory time. An employee of a public agency who has accrued compensatory time and requests use of this compensatory time shall be permitted to use such time off within a reasonable period after making the request, if such use does not unduly disrupt the operations of the county and department within which the employee works. What constitutes a "reasonable period" will be determined by considering the customary work practices within the department based on the facts and circumstances in each case. Such practices include, but are not limited to, (a) the normal schedule of work, (b) anticipated peak workloads based on past experience, (c) emergency requirements for staff and services, and (d) the availability of qualified substitute staff.
(5)
Cash in lieu of compensatory time.
a.
Overtime compensation due under the FLAS may be paid in cash at the county's option, in lieu of providing compensatory time off hereunder, in any workweek or work period. The FLSA does not prohibit an employer from freely substituting cash, in whole or part, for compensatory time off; and overtime payment in cash would not affect subsequent granting of compensatory time off in future workweeks or work periods.
b.
Cash overtime compensation must be paid at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which the employee is actually paid.
(6)
Cash compensation at termination of employment.
a.
Upon termination of employment, an employee shall be paid for unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation not less than:
1.
The average regular rate received by such employee during the last three years of the employee's employment, or
2.
The final regular rate received by such employee, whichever is higher.
b.
The phrase "last three years of employment" means the three-year period immediately prior to termination. Where an employee's last three years of employment are not continuous because of a break in service, the period of employment after the break in service will be treated as new employment. However, such a break in service must have been intended to be permanent and any accrued compensatory time earned after April 14, 1986, must have been cashed out at the time of initial separation. Where the final period of employment is less than three years, the average rate still must be calculated based on the rate(s) in effect during such period.
(7)
Emergency response exception. For road department and/or public safety personnel who are called in to assist in emergency response situations such as inclement weather, downed trees, or hazardous conditions, holiday leave will be counted as hours actually worked for purposes of overtime. Example: The applicable work period is seven days, Sunday through Saturday. In one work period, Monday is a holiday. A road department employee does not work that scheduled Monday Holiday, works eight hours per day Tuesday through Friday, and then is called in to work eight hours on Saturday due to a storm that occurred overnight Friday. The employee will be paid for 40 hours at his/her regular rate plus eight additional hours at the overtime rate.
(i)
Call-ins. If an employee is called into work on a date he or she was not scheduled to work, the employee will be paid for the greater of:
(1)
Actual time worked plus travel time from and return to the employee's home, or
(2)
Two hours.

All compensation, including annual leave pay, due to such employee, as of the effective date of separation, shall be paid to the beneficiary of the employee, the surviving spouse of such employee, or to the estate of such employee, as may be determined by law or by the applicable executed documents in the personnel folder of such employee.
(g)
Mandatory certification; reimbursement. Whenever an employee obtains a professional or trade certification at county expense, which certification is required as a condition of holding the employee's job position, no reimbursement shall be required from the employee if he or she remains in the employ of the county for two or more years after obtaining such certification. If the employee leaves the employ of the county within one year of obtaining such certification, the employee shall be liable to the county for reimbursement of 100 percent of all expenses incurred by the county for such certification, including, but not limited to, registration fees for training courses and certification examinations. If the employee leaves the employ of the county after one year but within two years of obtaining such certification, the employee shall be liable to the county for reimbursement of 50 percent of all expenses incurred by the county for such certification, including, but not limited to, registration fees for training courses and certification examinations.

ARTICLE III. - DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY

Sec. 50-71. - Rationale and employees covered.
Madison County is committed to maintaining a work environment free from the adverse impact of employee drug and alcohol abuse. Employee drug and alcohol abuses create serious risks of physical harm to employees, persons who rely on Madison County's services, and to the public. It constitutes a direct threat to the lives and property of the citizens of Madison County and the public health, safety and welfare of all persons in Madison County. Drug and alcohol abuse leads to increased accident rates and absenteeism, causes job performance and efficiency to suffer, seriously compromises safety in the workplace and community, and discredits the county government's reputation; therefore, Madison County will not tolerate an employee's possession, sale, distribution, consumption or presence in the body of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs while on county property or on county business at any time. In order to further the objective of protecting their persons and property of its employees, citizens and the general public, Madison County hereby adopts and implements the following policy.
(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. II,(§ 1))
Sec. 50-72. - Drug and alcohol use prohibited.
Substance and alcohol abuse by Madison County Employees during assigned working hours, in county building or on county grounds, or otherwise on county business is prohibited. This shall include the use of illegal substances, the abuse of prescription medications, and the use or abuse of alcohol.
(1)
Illegal drugs.
a.
Madison County prohibits employees from manufacturing, dispensing, using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing or selling or otherwise transferring any illegal drug or controlled substance while on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business. "Illegal drug or controlled substance" means any drug or substance the law prohibits individuals from manufacturing, dispensing, using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing or selling or otherwise transferring, including, without limitation, marijuana and cocaine, as well as drugs listed as controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, 21U.S.(c) 81(2)
b.
Madison County prohibits employees from being on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business while impaired due to any illegal drug or controlled substance. An employee is impaired due to the influence of an illegal drug or controlled substance. An employee is impaired due to the influence of an illegal drug or controlled substance if drug test results indicate the presence of an illegal drug or controlled substance in the employee's system in an amount that constitutes a positive test result under accepted scientific standards.
c.
Off-the-job illegal drug use or activity or arrest relating to such illegal drug use or activity is a violation of the policy. Off-the-job drug use or activity or arrest relating to such use or activity is likely to adversely affect the functioning of Madison County in many ways, including, without limitation, one or more of the following: adverse effects on job performance or attendance, jeopardizing the safety or welfare of the employee or fellow employees, jeopardizing the safety or welfare of persons which county services seek to protect, or risking damage to county or other property. An employee convicted for a violation of a criminal drug stature in the workplace or elsewhere or cited for a DUI, must notify the county no later than five days after such conviction.
(2)
Legally obtained drugs.
a.
Employees must not be on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles, or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business while impaired due to any drug, legal or illegal, that renders the employee unfit for duty. An employee is "unfit for duty" if, in the county's opinion, the employee's use of legally obtained drugs jeopardizes the employee's ability to work safely or efficiently. An employee who is using legally obtained drugs must notify the employee's immediate supervisor of any and all symptoms that may render the employee unfit for duty. If an employee's medically-required use of legally obtained drugs renders the employee unfit for duty and, in the opinion of the county, a temporary alternative job assignment is not available, the employee will be considered as an employee unfit for duty due to illness.
b.
Employees using prescription medication while on the job shall do so in strict accordance with medical directions. It is the employee's responsibility to notify the prescribing physician of the duties required by the employee's position and to insure the physician approves the use of the prescription medication while the employee is performing the employee's duties.
c.
The abuse or inappropriate use of legally prescribed drugs during assigned work hours is prohibited. Job performance or attendance deficiencies resulting from abuse or inappropriate use shall be cause for disciplinary action. If an employee's behavior or job performance gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that the employee is abusing or inappropriately using prescription medication, the employee may be required to submit to drug testing and to take any accrued sick or annual leave or leave without pay until such time as the employee is cleared to return to work by the employee's physician and department head.
(3)
Alcohol.
a.
Madison County prohibits employees from using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring alcoholic beverages on the job, on county property, while operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business.
b.
Madison County also prohibits employees from being at work or on county property or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business under the influence of alcohol. An employee is under the influence of alcohol if, based on the employee's speech, statements, behavior, conduct, appearance or odor, the county believes the employee is under the influence of alcohol. An employee is also under the influence if test results indicate the employee's blood alcohol concentration level is .04 or higher. An employee is also under the influence of alcohol if he has been arrested for operating, under the influence of alcohol, county equipment or vehicles or any other equipment or vehicles or any other equipment or vehicles on county business.
c.
Off-the-job uses of alcohol that the county reasonably believes adversely affect job performance or attendance, jeopardize the safety or welfare of the employee or fellow employees, jeopardize the safety, health or welfare of persons covered by the county's insurance programs or risks damage to county or other property are also a violation of this policy.
d.
Penalty for violation of the policy. An employee who, in the opinion of the county, violates any provision of this section 50-72 of this policy is subject to discipline as set forth in the Madison County Personnel Policy, up to and including discharge.
(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. II,(§ 2))
Sec. 50-73. - Pre-employment drug and alcohol testing.
(a)
Drug screening. To further the goal of providing a drug-free workplace and protecting the health, safety and welfare of the employees, citizens, and general public of Madison County, all job applicants being considered for employment shall be required to pass a drug screening test prior to employment. As a part of the pre-employment physical, the test will be required after the interview process has verified the applicant has the necessary skills required to perform the job duties. All job applicants will be informed in advance that the test shall be required. A candidate for employment shall not be allowed to start working until the drug test results have been reviewed and approved by the MRO, as defined below.
(b)
Positive test results. An applicant who has an initial screening positive test result for an illegal drug or controlled substance will not be hired and will not be reconsidered for any subsequent employment for a period of six months.
(c)
Consent. An applicant who refuses to consent to the test will not be hired.
(Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. II,(§ 3))
Sec. 50-74. - Testing for employees.
(a)
Requirement. To ensure the success of this drug and alcohol policy, the county will require employees to undergo urinalysis or other medical drug and alcohol detection procedures under the circumstances described below. All required medical tests, all procedures in connection therewith, the interpretation thereof and the determination of positive results will be conducted in accordance with the procedures for drug and alcohol testing set out in 49 CFR Part 40, which is incorporated herein by reference, at the county's expense, by qualified, county designated medical personnel under the direction of the person designated as the medical review officer, the "MRO". All job applicants and employees who are required to undergo testing must sign a consent form authorizing the medical personnel to conduct testing.
(b)
Random testing.
(1)
Certain positions are critical to the public welfare and the safety and health of fellow employees. Employees in safety and health sensitive positions or employees whose job duties require maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle or motorized equipment shall be required to submit to a drug and alcohol screening at unannounced times or on a periodic basis from time to time as determined by the county. The following positions are considered safety sensitive: the chairman and members of the board of commissioners; buildings and grounds custodian supervisor and maintenance supervisor; courthouse security; sheriff's department chief deputy, deputy sheriff's, investigators and lieutenants; jail cook, detention officers, jail administrator and nurse; D.A.R.E. officers; ambulance service director, assistant director, EMTs, paramedics, and supply manager; EMA director; E-911 director, assistant director and dispatchers; road department supervisor, assistant supervisor, drains and bridges technicians, heavy equipment operators, maintenance detail, mechanics, mowing crew and truck drivers; transfer station heavy equipment operators; senior center van drivers; recreation department maintenance coordinator, park maintenance supervisor and park maintenance technicians; building inspectors; code enforcement officer.
(2)
Employees in safety and health sensitive positions or employees whose job duties require maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle or motorized equipment may expect to be tested on an unannounced basis. The chairman of the board of commissioners, subject to review by the board, is authorized to develop an unannounced and anonymous method of selecting employees for testing on a periodic basis. In each unannounced selection, the names of all employees subject to testing shall be included for each draw of names to be tested. The chairman shall determine a percentage of employees to be tested each time that is deemed both cost effective and sufficient to insure that the goals of the policy are implemented. The chairman may direct the testing of any or all of the employees subject to testing on an occasional or periodic basis.
(3)
The board of commissioners may designate additional positions which are deemed to be safety sensitive and subject to testing on an unannounced or periodic basis.
(4)
Employees selected for random testing shall not be notified of the test until it is time to proceed to the collection site, and shall proceed to the collection site as quickly as possible upon notification and, in any event, no later than 4:30 p.m. If a selected employee is off duty or otherwise unavailable at the time the employer desires to conduct the test, the test will be rescheduled.
(5)
It is understood that firefighters and rescue personnel are volunteers and contribute their time unselfishly for the protection of the citizens of the county. The county recognizes that volunteer firefighters, first responders, and rescue personnel ordinarily hold full-time employment elsewhere. In order to avoid disrupting their employment, volunteers shall be given a reasonable period of time in which to report for such testing, but not less than 24 hours.
(c)
Reasonable suspicion testing.
(1)
Testing will be required when a supervisor reasonably suspects an employee is impaired or unfit for duty due to illegal drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol. Testing based on a reasonable belief an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of the policy may be drawn from specific objective and documented facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts and may be based upon, among other things:
a.
Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of possession, transfer or use of such drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol, or the physical symptoms of being impaired or unfit for duty due to any of same;
b.
Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work including, but not limited to: slurred speech, staggered gait, flushed face, dilated or pinpoint pupils, deterioration of work performance including absenteeism and tardiness; or a report of alcohol or drug use during assigned working hours provided by reliable and credible sources and independently corroborated.
(2)
Each employee is subject to, but not entitled to, drug or alcohol testing whenever the county reasonably suspects the employee uses illegal drugs or controlled substances, abuses legally obtained drugs, or abuses alcohol.
(3)
An employee who is tested pursuant to section 50-74(c) will be suspended pending the test outcome. If the test is negative, the employee will be allowed to return to work with full back pay, unless the suspension was imposed for additional reasons unrelated to this policy.
(d)
Post-accident testing. All employees involved in a work-related incident which requires medical attention, involves personal injury, or involves property damage may be tested promptly for drug and alcohol use in accordance with county policies, at the discretion of the department head. Any employee involved in a motor vehicle accident while driving a county vehicle on a public roadway shall be tested for drugs and alcohol. This section shall also apply to any employee involved in a motor vehicle accident while driving a private vehicle on county business.
(e)
Test results will be kept confidential. All information from an employee's or job applicant's drug and alcohol test shall be confidential and only available to the department head, board of commissioners and their legal counsel, the medical review officer, those employees of Madison County who have valid need to know, and those involved in any appeal process should it become necessary. Disclosure of test results to any other person, agency, or organization shall be prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee or job applicant. The results of a positive drug or alcohol test shall not be released until the results are confirmed. These confidentiality provisions are subject to and may be superseded by requirements of the Georgia Open Meetings Act, Georgia Open Records Act, and other state or federal laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, the requirement that evidence for disciplinary action by the board of commissioners be taken in open session.
(f)
List of medications. If an applicant or employee tests positive for drugs or alcohol, Madison County will ask the individual to provide a list of those prescriptions and over-the-counter medications recently used. The list of medications shall be kept confidential. The list of medications shall be disclosed only to the medical review officer who will determine whether the positive result was due to the lawful use of any of the listed medications.

(1)
The drugs to be tested for include, but are not limited to, the following:

(h)
Consent. Before a test is administered, employees and job applicants will be asked to sign a consent form authorizing the test and permitting release of test results to the employer and the medical review officials. The consent form shall provide a space for employees and job applicants to acknowledge they have been notified of the requirements of this policy.

Sec. 50-75. - Searches.
When a supervisor reasonably suspects, as outlined in section 50-74 of the policy, that an employee is impaired or unfit for duty due to an illegal drug, controlled substance, or alcohol, or that an employee is manufacturing, dispensing, using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing or selling or otherwise transferring any illegal drug, controlled substance or alcohol while on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business, the county shall have the right to conduct reasonable searches of the employee's clothing, briefcase, purse, lunch box, tool box, or motor vehicle. Prior to conducting a search pursuant to this section, the county will explain to the employee the reasons and grounds for the search and request the employee's consent to the search. Searches will be conducted in a manner that minimizes any intrusions into the employee's privacy. No search will be conducted if the employee refuses to consent to the search, but the employee's refusal to cooperate with search efforts may subject the employee to discipline up to and including discharge. If a search uncovers evidence of employee wrongdoing, illegal activity, or employee violations of county rules or policies, the evidence may be used to support disciplinary actions up to and including discharge.

An employee with a drug or alcohol abuse problem may voluntarily report such to his or her department head, to the human resources manager, or to the chairman of the board of commissioners. For purposes of this section, a voluntary admission is one made by the employee prior to actual or constructive notice that he or she is, or may in the immediate future be, asked or required to undergo a random, post-accident, or reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol test. If an employee makes a voluntary admission of drug or alcohol abuse pursuant hereto, he or she may be transferred to another position of employment within the county under the following conditions:
(1)
The position must be one not classified as safety sensitive under subsection 50-74(b)(1) hereof; the position must be one that does not require operation of equipment, machinery, or motor vehicles; and the position must be one which does not require direct contact with members of the public.
(2)
The position must be one that is in existence and vacant at the time of the voluntary admission; i.e., a position may not be created for the employee.
(3)
The employee must, at his or her own expense (to the extent not covered by any applicable insurance), immediately enter into evaluation and treatment with a substance abuse professional ("SAP"), in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed under 49 CFR Part 40, which terms and conditions are incorporated herein by reference. The employee must comply with the treatment plan prescribed by the SAP, and shall provide evidence of same to the county upon request.
(4)
The employee must, prior to transfer, present written certification from the SAP that he or she is capable of performing the duties of the proposed new position.
(5)
The employee shall, until satisfactory completion of the treatment program and certification of fitness to return to a safety sensitive position, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in 49 CFR Part 40, submit to drug and alcohol testing upon request. Failure to so submit, or a confirmed positive test, shall result in immediate dismissal.
(6)
The position vacated by the employee upon his or her voluntary admission shall not be held open; however, upon satisfactory completion of the treatment program and certification of fitness to return to a safety sensitive position, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in 49 CFR Part 40, the employee may apply and be considered for employment for vacant safety-sensitive positions in the same manner as any other county employee or applicant.
(7)
For purposes of determining whether a vacant position requires operation of a motor vehicle, it shall be presumed that all positions of employment in the county require the employee to hold the license and ability to operate a motor vehicle unless at least 75 percent of the positions within the department, or three positions within the department, whichever is greater, are already filled by employees holding such license and ability.
(8)
Failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereunder, including, but not limited to, failure to seek or make adequate progress in evaluation and treatment, or failure to provide evidence same upon request, shall constitute grounds for immediate dismissal.
