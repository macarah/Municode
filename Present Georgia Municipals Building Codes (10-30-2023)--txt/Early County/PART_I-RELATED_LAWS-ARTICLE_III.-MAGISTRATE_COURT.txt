ARTICLE III. - MAGISTRATE COURT[4]

Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Editor's note— Printed herein is 1978 Ga. Laws, page 3010, which created a small claims court for the county. Pursuant to Article VI, Section X, ¶ I, of the 1983 Georgia Constitution, small claims courts and justice of the peace courts became and were classified as magistrate courts. Accordingly, the term "small claims court" has been changed to "magistrate court" throughout this article without notation. Statutory provisions relating to magistrate courts are set forth in O.C.G.A. § 15-10-1 et seq. Amendments to the Act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Section 6. - Filing of claim; service of notice; costs of service; contents of notice.
(a)
Actions shall be commenced by the filing of a statement of claim, including the last known address of the defendant, in concise form and free from technicalities. The plaintiff or his agent shall verify the statement of claim by oath or affirmation in the form herein provided, or its equivalent, and shall affix his signature thereto. At the request of any individual, the judge or clerk may prepare the statement of claim and other papers required to be filed in an action.
(b)
A copy of the verified statement of claim, together with a notice of hearing in the form hereinafter prescribed, shall be served on the defendant, and such service shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction in the premises. Service of said notice shall be made only within the county. Said service shall be made by any official or person authorized by law to serve process in the superior court, by a duly qualified bailiff of the magistrate court, by registered or certified mail with receipt, or by any person not a party to, or otherwise interested in, the suit, who is specially appointed by the judge of said court for that purpose.
(c)
When notice is to be served by registered or certified mail, the clerk or the judge shall enclose a copy of the statement of claim, the verification and the notice in an envelope addressed to the defendant at his last known address, prepay the postage from moneys collected for that purpose, and mail the same forthwith, noting the date and hour of mailing on the record. When a receipt therefor is returned, or if the sealed envelope in which said notice was mailed to the defendant by registered or certified mail is returned to the sender by United States postal authorities marked "refused," giving the date of refusal, and such notation of refusal is signed or initialed by a United States postal employee or United States mail carrier to whom refusal was made, then the clerk or judge shall attach the same to the original statement and notice of claim, or otherwise file it as a part of the record in the case, and it shall be prima facie evidence of service upon the defendant.
(d)
When served by a private individual, as provided above, such individual shall make proof of service by affidavit, showing the time and place of such service on the defendant.
(e)
When served as provided, the actual cost of service shall be taxable as costs but shall not exceed $5.00. The cost of service shall be advanced by the party demanding same, in addition to the filing fee hereinafter provided, and shall be taxed as other costs.
(f)
Upon the failure of the defendant to appear, the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment by default, without further proof, when the claim of the plaintiff is for a liquidated amount.
(g)
Said notice shall include the date, hour and location of the hearing, which date shall not be less than ten nor more than thirty days from the date of the service of said notice; provided, however, that where service is made by registered or certified mail, the date of mailing shall be the date of service.
Section 7. - Maintenance of docket.
A docket shall be maintained in which every proceeding and ruling had in each case shall be indicated.
Section 8. - Court costs.
(a)
The plaintiff, when he files his claim, shall deposit the sum of $10.00 with the court, which shall cover all costs of the proceeding, except the cost of service of the notice. The deposit of cost in cases of attachment, garnishment or trover shall be $7.50. If a party shall fail to pay any accrued cost, the judge shall have the power to deny said party the right to file any new case while such costs remain unpaid, and, likewise, shall have the power to deny such litigant the right to proceed further in any pending case. The award of court costs, as between the parties, shall be in the discretion of the judge, and such costs shall be taxed in the cause at his discretion.
(b)
Whenever a claim affidavit and bond is filed by a third party claiming personal property that has been attached or levied upon under an attachment or execution issued from the magistrate court, the levying officer shall forthwith return the same to said court, and the issues raised by such claim affidavit shall be heard and determined by the judge of said magistrate court. The judge shall be entitled to a fee of $10.00 for every such claim case. The same rules of practice and procedure shall apply as in cases of affidavits of illegality. All attachment proceedings shall be tried by the judge and without a jury.
Section 9. - Conduct of trial.
(a)
The trial shall be conducted on the day set for the hearing, or at such later time as the judge may set. Immediately prior to the trial of any case, the judge shall make an earnest effort to settle the controversy by conciliation. If the judge fails to induce the parties to settle their differences without a trial, he shall proceed with the hearing on its merits.
(b)
The judge shall conduct the trial in such manner as to do substantial justice between the parties according to the rules of substantive law. All rules and regulations relating to pleading, practice and procedure shall be liberally construed so as to administer justice.
(c)
If the plaintiff fails to appear, the suit may be dismissed for want of prosecution, the defendant may proceed to a trial on the merits, or the case may be continued as the judge may direct. If both parties fail to appear, the judge may continue the case, order the same dismissed for want of prosecution, or make any other just and proper disposition thereof, as justice may require.
Section 10. - Claims against plaintiff.
If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff, the judge may require a statement of set-off to be filed, or same may be waived. If the plaintiff requires time to prepare his defense against such claim, the judge may continue the case for such purpose. If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff which exceeds the jurisdiction of the court, he may use a part thereof to offset the claim of the plaintiff.
Section 11. - Judgment payments—Generally.
When the judgment is to be rendered and the party against whom it is to be entered requests it, the judge shall inquire fully into the earnings and financial status of such party and shall have full discretionary power to stay the entry of judgment, to stay execution, and to order partial payments in such amounts, over such periods, and upon such terms as shall seem just under the circumstances and as will ensure a definite and steady reduction of the judgment until it is finally and completely satisfied.
Section 12. - Judgment payments—Deferred partial.
The judge of said magistrate court shall not be obligated to collect such deferred partial payments on judgments so rendered, but, if the plaintiff so requests, he may do so at the expense of the plaintiff for clerical and accounting costs incurred thereby.
Section 13. - Creation of rules by superior court judge.
The judge of the Superior Court of Early County may, from time to time, make rules for a simple, inexpensive and speedy procedure to effectuate the purposes of this Act and shall have power to prescribe, modify and improve the forms to be used therein to ensure the proper administration of justice and to accomplish the purposes hereof.
Section 14. - Bailiffs; appointment; powers and authority; oath of office; bond; removal.
The judge of said magistrate court shall have the power to appoint one or more bailiffs of and for said magistrate court to act within and throughout the limits of the county. Such bailiffs shall serve at the pleasure of the judge and under his direction. Any person so appointed shall be known and designated as "magistrate court Bailiff" and shall have the powers and authority, and shall be subject to the penalties, of lawful constables of the State of Georgia, including the power to serve any and all summons and writs issued from or by said magistrate court. Said bailiffs shall also have the power to make levies, conduct judicial sales, and account therefor, in the manner of lawful constables. Within five days following their appointment, all such bailiffs shall take and subscribe the oath of office prescribed in O.C.G.A. § 15-17-8 and give the bond prescribed in O.C.G.A. § 15-17-9. Such bailiffs shall be subject to removal from office for failure of duty or malfeasance in office, as are other lawful constables of this State. The sheriff of said county and his deputies shall also have the power and authority to serve summons, make levies and sales, and serve as ex officio bailiffs of said court.
Section 15. - Liens.
A judgment of said magistrate court shall become a lien on both the real and personal property of a defendant, regardless of where such property is situated within the State. Said judgment shall become a lien at the time an execution based upon such judgment is filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court for said county and the entry thereof is made by the clerk in the general execution docket for said county.
Section 16. - Appeals.
Appeals may be had from judgments returned in the magistrate court to the superior court and the same provisions now provided for by general law for appeals, contained in Code Chapter 6-1, to the superior court, shall be applicable to appeals from the magistrate court to the superior court, the same to be a de novo appeal.
Editor's note— O.C.G.A. § 5-3-1, which provided a right of appeal to the superior court, was repealed by 1983 Ga. Laws, page 884. Provisions for appeals from judgments returned in the magistrate court are now set forth in O.C.G.A. § 15-10-41.
Section 17. - Form of claim, verification and notice.
Until otherwise provided by the rules of the court, the statement of claim, verification and notice shall be in the following form, or equivalent form, and shall be in lieu of any forms now employed and of any form of summons now provided by law:
