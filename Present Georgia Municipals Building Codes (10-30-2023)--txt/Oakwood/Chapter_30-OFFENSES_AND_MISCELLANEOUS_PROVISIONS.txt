Sec. 30-180. - Legal status provisions.
It is important for a community to appear clean, well-kept and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores and unhealthy conditions.

A clean, safe and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment and make citizens proud of the area in which they live.

It is therefore the purpose and intent of this division to encourage clean, healthy, and well-maintained properties free of nuisances, eyesores and unhealthy, unsafe or devaluating conditions. To this end, this division seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values and aesthetics of properties.
