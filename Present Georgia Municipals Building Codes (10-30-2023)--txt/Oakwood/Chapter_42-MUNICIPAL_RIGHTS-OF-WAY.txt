(Ord. No. 332, § 2.01, 6-27-2000)
Sec. 42-69. - Findings, intent and purpose.
(a)
The public rights-of-way are a valuable and scarce community resource. In order to provide for the health, safety and well-being of its inhabitants, to ensure the structural integrity of its streets and the appropriate use of the rights-of-way and to protect the investment of its residents, the city strives to keep its rights-of-way in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances.
(b)
Traditionally, along with the facilities of electric, gas and other utilities, telecommunications equipment facilities including wires (whether fiber optic, coaxial cables or otherwise) have been laid in the public rights-of-way. Local exchange carriers often have one set of lines, long distance providers another, cable companies others and fiber optic providers still others.
(c)
Availability of and demand for a variety of telecommunications services and delivery technologies has dramatically increased the demand for use of the rights-of-way. In addition, new technologies and increased competition foster more intensive use of public rights-of-way which, in turn, requires more intensive management of the rights-of-way to ensure orderly use, maintenance of public safety, reliable delivery of essential services and equitable treatment of all users. Increasing demand for use of public rights-of-way is causing, and continues to cause, local governments to expand management services and responsibilities including more frequent inspections, repairs, re-paving, mapping technologies and systems and increased personnel. Consequently, the responsibility to manage public rights-of-way requires the ability to place appropriate conditions on their use.
(d)
In response to the foregoing, the city hereby adopts the ordinance from which this division is derived which imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and maintenance of telephone companies' equipment currently located within its rights-of-way or which shall be placed therein at some future time. The division is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and federal agencies.
(Ord. No. 332, § 1.01, 6-27-2000)
Sec. 42-70. - General provisions.
(a)
City's right of oversight. The work of constructing, erecting and maintaining facilities of a telephone company shall be done under the regulation of the city and shall be subject to the police power of the city and the city's ordinances. The city has the right to oversee, regulate and inspect the installation, construction, technical operation, upgrade, repair, maintenance and removal of equipment in accordance with the provisions of this division and applicable law. The city reserves the right to adopt or issue such rules, regulations, orders or other directives governing a telephone company or its equipment as it shall find necessary or appropriate in the exercise of its police power or the management of the city streets and such other orders as the city shall find necessary or appropriate pursuant to and in furtherance of the purposes of this division. The use of the streets by a telephone company shall not interfere with the use of the streets by others except to the extent permitted by this division. The telephone company shall leave all streets and other property in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the telephone company's installation, construction, technical operation, upgrade, repair, maintenance or removal of the equipment from the streets and without materially affecting, altering or disturbing in any way any electric or other cables or wires or any pipes, structures or attachments. The city shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of such streets and to require the telephone company to make any additional repairs in order to bring such streets to the condition required by this division.
(b)
Regulation of use of streets preserved. Nothing in this division restricts the authority of the city to regulate the use and occupancy of the streets by any person or entity providing service. Persons or entities subject to paying a fee pursuant to chapter 14, article II, division 2 shall not be exempt from municipal regulations relating to the time, manner and method of installation, construction, technical operation, upgrade, repair, maintenance and removal of the equipment located within the city's streets. Pursuant to applicable provisions of the city charter and other general law, the city expressly reserves its right to require a franchise from any telephone company providing service whose equipment occupies the city's streets.
(c)
Permits and approvals. Pursuant to city ordinances or other applicable regulations, a telephone company shall obtain all construction, building or other permits or approvals necessary before constructing, installing, operating, upgrading, repairing, maintaining or removing equipment. Prior to the city's issuing a construction, building or other permit, a telephone company may be required to:
(1)
Submit an application in writing specifically describing the nature, extent and location of the portion of the rights-of-way to be used by the telephone company; and
(2)
Furnish an indemnity bond acceptable to the city or other security acceptable to the city for any damage to any part of the street, the city or to any member of the public caused by the work of the telephone company performed under authority of such permit.
The obligations of the telephone company under this division and any liability of the telephone company shall not be limited by the city's acceptance of the bond or the security. Any fees that the city charges to a telephone company to issue construction, building or other permits or approvals shall not be offset against the compensation that a telephone company is required to pay to the city pursuant to chapter 14, article II, division 2 nor against any other fees or taxes the telephone company may pay the city.
(d)
Repair and replacement of streets. A telephone company shall, at its own cost and expense, replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base and landscape treatment of any public sidewalk or street that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance or repair of its facilities promptly and in no event later than ten days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the city in effect at the time of the work. Upon failure of a telephone company to perform any such repair or replacement, after ten days' notice from the city, the city or its agent or contractor may repair such portion of the streets as may have been disturbed by a telephone company, its contractors or agents and, upon receipt of a bill from the city, a telephone company will promptly reimburse the city for its costs so incurred. Such repair or replacement shall restore the streets to the condition required by subsection (a) of this section.
(e)
Abandoned equipment. All equipment including both aerial and underground equipment that is abandoned within the public rights-of-way shall be removed by the telephone company unless an alternative plan is approved by the city.

Such telephone company shall be liable for all costs and damages arising from the presence of the abandoned equipment in the public rights-of-way.
(f)
New grades or lines; relocations. If the grades or lines of any street are changed at any time during the term, then the telephone company shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the notice of the city, protect or promptly alter or relocate equipment so as to conform with such new grades or lines. Upon notice from the city, a telephone company shall remove and relocate equipment where the city deems such removal and relocation necessary as a result of the construction or maintenance of any part of the street or due to the extension of a public road. If a telephone company refuses or neglects to so protect, alter or relocate equipment, in accordance with this subsection, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter or relocate such equipment and a telephone company shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation. The city and its officers, employees, agents, attorneys, consultants and independent contractors shall not have any liability to the telephone company for any damage as a result of or in connection with the breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation.
(g)
Quality. All work involved in the installation, construction, technical operation, upgrade, repair, maintenance and removal of equipment shall be performed in a safe, thorough and reliable manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the city or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction that any equipment is harmful to the health or safety of any person, then a telephone company shall, at its own cost and expense, promptly correct all such conditions.
(h)
No obstruction. In connection with the installation, construction, technical operation, upgrade, repair, maintenance and removal of equipment, a telephone company shall not obstruct the streets, subways, railways, rivers or other traffic to, from or within the corporate limits of the city without the prior consent of the city. Equipment of a telephone company in the streets shall be located so as to cause minimum interference with the use of the streets and adjoining property.
(i)
No interference. A telephone company shall not interfere with the technical operation of any other telecommunications system or any other utility operating within the rights-of-way within the corporate limits of the city.
(j)
Underground utilities. A telephone company shall comply with any current or future city ordinances, rules or orders requiring the placement of equipment underground.
(k)
Moving equipment. A telephone company shall, upon prior written notice by the city or any person holding a permit to move any structure and, within the time that is reasonable under the circumstances, temporarily move equipment to permit the moving of said structure. A telephone company may impose a reasonable charge on any person other than the city for any such movement of its equipment.
(l)
Emergency relocation of equipment. The city may, at any time, in case of fire, disaster or other emergency as determined by the city in its sole discretion, cut or move equipment, in which event the city shall not incur any liability to a telephone company, any affiliated person or any other person. When possible, a telephone company shall be consulted prior to any such cutting or movement of equipment and shall be given the opportunity to perform such work itself. All costs to repair or replace such equipment shall be borne by a telephone company. If the city determines that the failure of a telephone company to properly restore or repair the streets constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts. A telephone company shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city in regard to the repair or restoration.
(m)
Street closings. If all or any part of the streets are eliminated, discontinued or de-mapped, the telephone company shall cease operation of the telecommunications system with respect to such streets upon the effective date of a final action of the city in connection therewith.
(Ord. No. 332, § 3.01, 6-27-2000)
Sec. 42-71. - Oversight and regulation.
(a)
Reports. At the request of the city, a telephone company shall promptly submit to the city such information as the city may reasonably request regarding a telephone company and any affiliated person to verify compliance with any term or condition of this division. The city may require a telephone company to provide, among other things, written construction plans in advance of beginning construction and to provide as-built drawings after construction completion.
(b)
Treatment of proprietary information. Access by the city to any of the documents, records or other information covered by this division shall not be denied on grounds that such documents, records or information contain proprietary information. A telephone company may label any documents, records or other information as proprietary if it considers them such and the city shall protect the documents, records or other information from disclosure to the extent permitted under applicable law. In the event that any other person requests such information under the Georgia Open Records Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq.) and the city reasonably believes that such requested documents, records or information may be within the exclusion guidelines of the Georgia Open Records Act, the city shall not release proprietary documents, records or other information without written notice to a telephone company.

Such policy shall insure:
(1)
A telephone company; and
(2)
The city and its officers, boards, commissions, councils, elected officials, agents and employees (through appropriate endorsements if necessary) against each and every form of liability of a telephone company referred to in this division in the minimum combined amount of $1,000,000.00 or such other amount as may be agreed to by the city, for bodily injury and property damage.
The foregoing minimum limitation shall not prohibit a telephone company from obtaining a liability insurance policy or policies in excess of such limitations provided that the city, its officers, boards, commissions, councils, elected officials, agents and employees shall be named as additional insured to the full extent of any limitation contained in any such policy or policies obtained by a telephone company. Notwithstanding the above, in lieu of the insurance coverage required by this subsection (a), a telephone company may provide such proof of financial resources as may be deemed acceptable by the city that a telephone company may have available to pay claims.
(b)
Liability not limited. The legal liability of a telephone company to the city and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the liability insurance policies required by this division including, without limitation, a telephone company's indemnification obligations set forth in this division, shall not be limited by the insurance policies required by subsection (a) of this section nor by the recovery of any amounts thereunder except to the extent necessary to avoid duplicative recovery from or payment by a telephone company.
(c)
Liability of telephone company. A telephone company shall be responsible for any liability including, without limitation, any liability of the city and any person including, without limitation, any officer, employee, agent, attorney, consultant and independent contractor of the city arising out of or in connection with the installation, construction, technical operation, upgrade, repair, maintenance and removal of equipment.
