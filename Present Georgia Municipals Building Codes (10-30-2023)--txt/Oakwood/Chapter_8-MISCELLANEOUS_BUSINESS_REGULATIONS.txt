ARTICLE IV. - HOOKAH, E-CIGARETTES AND/OR VAPOR LOUNGE/BAR

Sec. 8-80. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
The governing body of the City of Oakwood (hereinafter referred to as "city") finds that the use of hookah pipes, electronic cigarettes, vape pens and other similar devices in hookah, e-cigarette and/or vapor lounges/bars and the activities associated with such businesses (including loud music, large numbers of customers congregating for long periods, etc.) have been associated with increases in odors, noise, vapors, second-hand smoke, parking impacts, loitering and disturbances in the peace. The purpose of this section is to prevent the overconcentration of this land use and to mitigate the negative impacts associated with this land use.
(b)
The governing body also finds that smoking and vaping land uses expose minors to dangerous secondhand smoke byproducts and increase the potential for minors to associate smoking of hookah pipes, electronic tobacco devices and vaping devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle.
(c)
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted laboratory analysis of electronic cigarette samples and found them to contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals to which users and bystanders could potentially be exposed, suggesting that the same health and public nuisance concerns present with conventional cigarettes exist with electronic cigarettes.
(d)
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that smoking a hookah has many of the same health risks as cigarette smoking; that hookah use by youth is increasing; that the charcoal used to heat hookah tobacco can have negative health risks because it produces high levels of carbon monoxide, metals and carcinogens; that hookah smokers may absorb more of the toxic substances also found in cigarette smoke than cigarette smokers do; that secondhand smoke from hookahs can be a health risk for nonsmokers; and that new forms of electronic hookah smoking are now on the market and very little information is available on the health risks of electronic tobacco products.
(e)
The State of Georgia regulates smoking in public areas under the Georgia Smokefree Air Act of 2005.
(Ord. No. 2020-CO-02-796, § 1, 3-9-2020)

(b)
The provisions of this section shall apply to new facilities established following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title. All legal, code-compliant hookah, e-cigarette, and vapor lounges/bars currently located in the city shall become legal, nonconforming uses, and as such must comply with the regulations of such non-conforming uses a set forth in the city's Unified Land Development Code.
(Ord. No. 2020-CO-02-796, § 1, 3-9-2020)
