(Ord. No. 2019-008 , § 1, 3-11-2019)
Sec. 34-3. - Registration of vacant principal buildings.
(a)
Whenever any principal building is lawfully vacant for more than 60 days and is in violation of this article, the owner, shall within ten days of a building becoming vacant, register, or cause to be registered, such building, as a vacant building with the city. The storage of various items within a building and/or the maintaining of functioning utilities for a building/property is not sufficient in itself to deem a building to be "occupied." The registration shall not apply to any accessory buildings on the same property.
(b)
Any building shall be exempt from registration under this section provided that the building is currently and continuously being marketed for sale and is not otherwise in violation of this article. At any time such building ceases to be marketed for sale or at such time as the building becomes vacant for a period greater than 60 days, then the owner of such building, dwelling or structure, shall within ten days of such event, register, or cause to be registered such building as a vacant building with the city. The building/property owner must provide valid documentation to the code enforcement officer that the building/property is actually being marketed for sale. The posting of a private "for sale" sign on a property is not sufficient in itself to deem a property and/or building to be marketed for sale.
(c)
The vacant building registration application shall be completed by the current property/building owner accompanied with a one-time, $50.00 administrative fee. Registration of a vacant building shall be valid for a period of 12 months, provided that a significant change in status for the property, such as a change in ownership, does not occur. The city shall be notified of any post-registration ownership changes, which shall prompt a new registration and administrative fee for the new owner of the vacant building/property.
(d)
Registrations and the associated fees shall be based on the date a building/property becomes vacant or changes ownership. Registration fees are non-refundable and not pro-rated, should the vacant property become lawfully occupied/used in less time than the 12-month registration period. Registration fees shall be per each parcel that each property owner owns within the city.
(e)
The owner(s) registering a vacant building shall supply the following information on an authorized form provided by the city:
(1)
Name, address (mailing and street), facsimile number, e-mail address and telephone number of the owner(s);
(2)
Name, address (mailing and street), facsimile number, e-mail address and telephone number of any local agent or representative of the owner(s);
(3)
Whether a property is a nuisance under the terms of this chapter 34, article III;
(4)
Street address and tax parcel identification number of the premises on which the vacant building(s) is situated;
(5)
Transfer date of the instrument conveying the real property to the owner(s);
(6)
At such time as it becomes available, recording information, including deed book and page numbers, of the instrument conveying the real property to the owner(s);
(7)
Recorded plat of property, if available;
(8)
Date on which the building became vacant;
(9)
A detailed plan-of-action for the vacant building/property, stating the future intent for the premises, such as the sale or use of a vacant occupiable building, the rehabilitation and future use of a vacant substandard building, or the demolition of a vacant, unsafe building. The plan-of-action is subject to approval by the city, and the city reserves the right to place additional requirements within the plan-of-action.
(f)
If the building remains vacant at the expiration of the 12-month registration period and the owner's plan-of-action has not been completed, the current owner shall re-register such building for another 12 months at no additional charge. If the current owner's plan-of-action has been deemed to be complete by the code enforcement officer, and the property is no longer vacant, then the building/property may come off the vacant property registry. It is the responsibility of the owner(s) to notify the city of any changes to the status of vacant properties and of any changes to the information on their registration form.
(g)
A conviction of any person of failure or refusal to comply with an order of the code enforcement officer issued pursuant to this section shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $100.00 and not to exceed $500.00.

Sec. 34-4. - Acquisition of vacant buildings by eminent domain.
(a)
The city may acquire by eminent domain pursuant to applicable state law, any property determined to be vacant and a persistent nuisance, and shall have the power to hold, clear, manage or dispose of property so acquired for residential, commercial, industrial and related use. Such process shall follow the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 22-1-15 and other applicable provisions of Title 22 of the O.C.G.A.
(b)
The mayor and city council shall not institute eminent domain proceedings pursuant to this section unless the code enforcement officer has certified that the property is vacant and a persistent nuisance. A property may only be certified to the mayor and city council as vacant and a persistent nuisance after the code enforcement officer has determined that:
(1)
The owner(s) of the property or designated agent has been sent a notice or order by the appropriate agency of the municipality to eliminate the conditions which are in violation of the local codes or law;
(2)
The property is truly vacant;
(3)
The property is a nuisance under the terms of chapter 34, article III;
(4)
The city has notified the property owner(s) or designated agent that the property has been determined to be blighted or deteriorated and the time period for correction of such condition has expired and the property owner or agent has failed to comply with this notice.
(c)
The findings required by subsection (b) shall be in writing and included in the report prepared by the code enforcement officer to the mayor and city council.
(d)
The code enforcement officer shall notify the owner(s) of the property or a designated agent that a determination that the property is vacant and a persistent nuisance has been made and that failure to eliminate the conditions causing such condition shall render the property subject to condemnation by the city under this part. Notice shall be mailed to the owner(s) or designated agent by certified mail, return receipt requested. However, if the address of the owner(s) or designated agent is unknown and cannot be ascertained by code enforcement in the exercise of reasonable diligence, copies of the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property affected and notice shall be published in the newspaper which is the official legal organ of the county in which the sheriffs advertisements appear. The written notice sent to the owner(s) or the owner's agent shall describe the conditions that render the property blighted and deteriorated, and shall demand abatement of the conditions within 90 days of the receipt of such notice.
(e)
An extension of the 90-day time period may be granted by the city if the owner(s) or designated agent demonstrates that such period is insufficient to correct the conditions cited in the notice.
(f)
No elected official, officer or employee of the city shall acquire and interest in any property declared to be vacant or a persistent nuisance.
(g)
If any elected official, officer or employee owns or has a financial interest, direct or indirect, in any property certified to be vacant and a persistent nuisance, the officer or employee shall immediately disclose, in writing, such interest to the mayor and city council, and such disclosure shall be entered in the minutes of the city council.
(h)
Failure to so disclose such interest shall constitute misconduct in office.
(i)
No payment shall be made to any elected official, officer or employee for any property or interest therein acquired by the city from such elected official, officer or employee unless the amount of such payment is fixed by court order in eminent domain proceedings, or unless payment is unanimously approved by the mayor and city council.
