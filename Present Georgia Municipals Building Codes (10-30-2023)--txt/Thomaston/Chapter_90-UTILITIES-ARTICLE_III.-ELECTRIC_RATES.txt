a.
Incremental reserve, per incremental reserve capacity in kW .....$0.65/kW
b.
Incremental transmission, per incremental transmission capacity in kW .....$3.40/kW
(e)
Procedure: The customer's actual maximum metered demand in kW and metered energy consumption in kWh in each calendar month of calendar year 2013 will serve as the customer's base demand in kW and base energy in kWh.
Beginning March 1, 2014, and in each month thereafter until this schedule IIE or its successors will have been terminated, the customer's incremental energy in kWh, incremental reserve capacity in kW, and the incremental transmission capacity in kW will be determined as follows:
(1)
Incremental energy in the current month = metered energy in the current month—Base energy from the corresponding base month.
a.
Incremental energy is restricted to be greater than or equal to 0 kWh.
b.
Incremental reserve capacity in the current month = the largest metered demand from the most recent months of June—September—The largest metered demand of the base months June 2013—September 2013.
1.
Incremental reserve capacity is restricted to be greater than or equal to 0 kW.
2.
Prior to June 2014, incremental reserve capacity will be 0 kW.
c.
Incremental transmission capacity for the current month = maximum metered demand for the current month—The maximum metered demand from the corresponding base month.
1.
Incremental transmission capacity is restricted to be greater than or equal to 0 kW.
(f)
Minimum bill provision: Each month the customer's total bill will be calculated using two methods. The lesser bill resulting from the two methods will be charged to the customer.
(1)
Calculate charges under the current LPE rate using the current month's maximum metered demand and metered energy.
(2)
Calculate charges under the then current LPE rate using base energy and base demand plus amounts charged under this schedule IIE or its successors.
(g)
Wholesale facility charge: The wholesale facility charge (the "WFC") will collect the costs of wholesale facilities (such as metering, switchgear, maintenance fees, etc.), if any, imposed upon the city by any of its wholesale suppliers for delivery of incremental energy to customers that take service under this schedule IIE or its successors. The WFC will generally be collected on a monthly basis unless the customer and the commission mutually agree upon other arrangements.
Should such wholesale facilities be used by more than one customer, the WFC associated with such facilities will be pro-rated to each customer on the basis of each customer's maximum non-coincident demand in kW.
(h)
Distribution facility charge: The distribution facility charge (the "DFC") will collect the costs of distribution facilities (such as metering, switchgear, lines, poles, transformers, etc.) which are necessary to deliver incremental energy that in the sole opinion of the city are considered to be extraordinary cost items relative to the rates and charges included hereinabove. The DFC will generally be collected on a monthly basis unless the customer and the city mutually agree upon other arrangements.
Should such wholesale facilities be used by more than one customer, the DFC associated with such facilities will be pro-rated to each customer on the basis of each customer's maximum non-coincident demand in kW.
(i)
Revenue adjustment rider: The bill calculated at the above rate is subject to change in such an amount as may be determined under the provisions of the city's revenue adjustment riders (if any), or as may be later amended.
(j)
Term: This schedule will remain in effect for a period of 60 consecutive consumption months (five years) beginning with the consumption month bills are first rendered under this schedule IIE-1.
(k)
Amendment: This schedule may be amended, changed, or adjusted at the discretion of the city as set forth in its rules, regulations, and ordinances.

(a)
Applicability. To customers in all areas served by the City of Thomaston (the city) and subject to its service rules, regulations, terms, policies and procedures, as amended from time to time, which are incorporated herein by this reference, and desiring to install a distributed generation facility. Customer account(s) must be in good standing. A distributed generation facility must:
(1)
Be owned (or leased) and operated by an existing customer for production of electric energy; and
(2)
Be connected to and/or operate in parallel with the city's distribution facilities; and
(3)
Be intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer's generator's requirement for electricity; and
(4)
Have peak generating capacity of not more than ten kW for residential applications and not more than 125 percent of actual or expected maximum annual peak demand of the premise for commercial applications; [and]
(5)
Be installed on the customer side of the meter.
(b)
Monthly metering charge. The city electric department will install single directional metering or bi-directional metering depending on the customer's method of installation. All installed costs for metering and associated equipment will be paid by the customer at the time service is initiated under this policy.
Bi-directional metering is defined as measuring the amount of electricity supplied by the City and the amount fed back to the city by the customer's distributed generation facility during the billing period using the same meter. Bi-directional metering shall be used where distributed generation facilities are connected to the city on the customer's side of the customer's meter.
Single directional metering shall be defined as measuring electricity produced or consumed during the billing period, in accordance with normal metering practices. Single directional metering shall be used where distributed generation facilities are connected to the city's distribution system on the city's side of the customer's meter.
(1)
Bi-directional: $2.50 per month; or
(2)
Single directional:
a.
Single-phase: $4.50 per month; or
b.
Poly-phase $11.00 per month.
(c)
Monthly capacity cost. The city requires each customer with a distributed generation facility to pay the monthly stand-by capacity charges based on the installed nameplate capacity rating (in kW) of the customer's system.
(1)
Residential: $13.18 per kW per month.
(2)
Commercial non-demand: $18.32 per kW per month.
(3)
Small power: $21.17 per kW per month.
(4)
Medium power: $21.51 per kW per month.
(5)
Large power: $25.81 per kW per month.
(6)
Industrial: $22.38 per kW per month.
(7)
School: $23.93 per kW per month.
(d)
Payment for energy.
(1)
Bi-directional metering:
a.
When electricity supplied by the city exceeds electricity generated by the customer's distributed generation, the electricity shall be billed by the city in accordance with the applicable tariff(s).
b.
When electricity generated by the customer's distributed generation system exceeds electricity supplied by the city, the customer shall be billed for the customer charges as described in the standard rate for that billing period and credited for excess kWh generated during the billing period at the city's avoided energy cost.
(2)
Single directional metering:
a.
For kWh's generated by customer's distributed generation facility, customer shall be compensated at the city's avoided cost of energy (kwh) as determined by the city. The city will only compensate customer for avoided energy kwh's as determined by metered energy delivered to the city's distribution system.
b.
The customer's net bill will be calculated using the city calculation for avoided energy cost (as described below) credited to the customer, netted against the billing period charges for the customer's regular service (according to the applicable tariff) based on actual metered energy.
(3)
Avoided energy cost. Payments by the city to the customer for the billing period metered avoided energy kWh's will be computed by the city in its sole discretion based on the average monthly wholesale market price as determined by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), the city's wholesale energy provider.
In the event customer develops a credit balance during a billing period, the amount will remain as a credit on the customer's account. Credit balances remaining at the end of the city's fiscal year will be cleared by the issuance of a check for the credit balance to customer. Any other clearance of account credit balances will be at the city's discretion.
(e)
Safety, power quality, and interconnection requirements. The customer shall be responsible for ensuring a safe and reliable interconnection with the city and all costs incurred therein. The city has available, upon request, the following documents that must be completed and approved in their entirety prior to interconnection by the customer to the city's distribution system:
(1)
Application for interconnection of distributed generation facility;
(2)
Interconnection agreement;
(3)
Electrical power exchange agreement.
The provisions in all documents outlined above are incorporated into this tariff in their entirety. For the avoidance of doubt, customer shall be deemed to have agreed to such provisions by applying for service under this tariff.
The city will only be required to purchase energy from eligible distributed generation facilities on a first-come, first-served basis until the cumulative generating capacity of all renewable energy sources from all customers equals the percentage of the city's annual peak demand in the previous year as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 46-3-56(a). Additional energy may be purchased by the city at its sole discretion at a cost agreed to by it and the customer provider. The city shall at no time be required to purchase energy from customers in excess of amounts required by the DG Act.
The city reserves the right to separate the customer generator's equipment from city lines and facilities when, in the city's judgment, the continued parallel operation is unsafe or may cause damage to persons or property. Upon such separation, the city shall promptly notify the customer generator so that any unsafe condition can be corrected.
