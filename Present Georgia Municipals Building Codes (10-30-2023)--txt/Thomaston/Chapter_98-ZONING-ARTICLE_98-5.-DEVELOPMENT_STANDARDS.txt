98-5.3.2.19. Convenience and other food stores that dispense fuels.
A.
Purpose of these standards. Residents of the city are best served by a variety of retail, service, office, entertainment and other establishments catering to consumer needs. An excessive number of establishments offering similar consumer goods can preclude opportunities for such a diverse range of businesses. The compact development pattern characterizing Thomaston can produce a concentration of businesses vying for consumer attention. Coupled with the long history of Thomaston, this circumstance can mean that few undeveloped lots remain. Those lots that do remain are typically smaller and cannot accommodate more desirable developments such as mixed use developments or large department stores. Accordingly, a need exists in Thomaston, particularly in the downtown, for larger stores capable of supplying a more diverse range of merchandise. The comprehensive plan highlights the character of the downtown as having quaint shops and cafes and cites "historical commercial uses" as desired future uses. The abundance of convenience stores does not facilitate establishment of these uses and can inhibit the city's efforts to promote Thomaston as a destination for consumers within the 20-mile market radius identified in the July 2021 Downtown Thomaston Master Plan Market Analysis Report.
B.
Convenience and other food stores that also dispense fuels shall comply with the following standards:
1.
No such store shall have a gross floor area less than 3,000 square feet.
2.
No such store shall be located within 1,000 feet of any lot zoned for residential purposes as measured in a straight line from property boundary to property boundary.
3.
The hours of operation shall be no earlier than 6:00 a.m. and no later than 11:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and no earlier than 6:00 a.m. and no later than 12:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. These hours of operation shall include solid waste removal and fuel deliveries.
4.
Site lighting shall be directed downward and on to the property.
5.
No loudspeakers shall be operated on the property.
6.
All such store properties shall provide two points of vehicle access to the property.
7.
A minimum of two trash receptacles shall be provided in locations and in sufficient sizes to accommodate customer volumes.
8.
Landscaping in the form of shrubs and ground covers shall be installed along a minimum of ten percent of the front building facade. Such landscaping shall be in addition to landscaping required by article 10, buffer and landscaping standards. A minimum of four planters each having a capacity of ten gallons and planted and maintained with shrubs and ground covers, including mulch, shall be placed along the front building facade of developed sites.
9.
Placement of vending machines or other goods, merchandise or equipment shall comply with subsection 98-5.3.2.22, collection bins, vending machines and newsstands.
10.
No trailer or accessory building of any kind shall be placed, parked or otherwise stored on the premises.
C.
C-stores fulfill the role of the "gas station." The traditional gas station has been replaced by convenience stores selling fuel. National chains like Racetrack and QT have established a new standard in gas stations, meeting the needs of the traveling public. To ensure that fueling stations at convenience stores remain a viable option in the marketplace, all new convenience stores shall also sell fuel. A minimum of 12 fueling stations will help address the needs of motorists traveling in Thomaston without being a burden on the operator as recent development in this industry features many more fueling stations. In order to control scale, the number of fuel dispensers shall not exceed 28 individual fuel pumps.
D.
Limit on number of convenience stores. At some 21 stores meeting or approximating the definition of convenience stores operating in Thomaston, that ratio to population is deemed far higher than a healthy commercial climate would allow. The city seeks to pare this segment of retailers by placing appropriate limits on convenience stores.
1.
The findings of a retailing study performed by Urban Partners dated August 31, 2021 support the need for such "paring." Their review of retailing data shows that "…94% of the entire retail supply for Upson County is located in the City of Thomaston…" Data presented in the study are based on an analysis of "Selected Retail Supply and Demand" figures found in table 15, trade area retail supply and demand characteristics. This analysis documents that 2021 supply sales in convenience stores far outstrip 2021 demand expenditures for a significant gap of $2,020,847. The number of such stores that would be required to best align convenience store supply within the Thomaston Tracts Trade Area Retail Supply with demand expenditures in that trade area is 7.84 stores, or eight convenience stores.
2.
Accordingly, convenience stores shall be subject to approval of a special use and shall be limited to eight such stores within the city limits based on data published in the Downtown Thomaston Master Plan Market Analysis Report. No application for a special use to establish a convenience store shall be accepted when the total number of convenience stores would continue to exceed eight such stores. The building official shall compile a record of the names, locations and owners of all stores in the city that are deemed to be convenience stores which record shall be maintained by the city clerk and shall be a public record.
E.
Concentration of convenience stores. In order to avoid concentration of such retailers, no application for a special use approval shall be accepted whenever the proposed location lies within one-half mile of an existing convenience store. This minimum distance shall apply whether the store is located within the city limits or in unincorporated county and shall be measured along the street right-of-way from the nearest boundary of the property occupied by a convenience store to the nearest boundary of the property proposed for establishment of a new convenience store.
98-5.3.2.20. Convenience and other food stores that do not dispense fuels. Convenience stores that do not dispense fuels shall be prohibited.

Paved parking shall not be required for any overflow parking that is not required by article 9, parking and loading; pavers and decorative stone shall be acceptable. Grasscrete products or other pervious materials shall also be acceptable. Gravel such as "57 Stone" typically used for commercial or industrial applications shall not be permitted. Off-street parking and all existing buildings shall be depicted on a sketch, drawn to scale on a property survey of the lot.
E.
Hours of operation. The hours of operation shall be 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. These hours of operation shall not apply to setup and cleanup time before and after an event.
F.
Accessory buildings and structures. All buildings and structures, including tents and canopies, utilized for events shall meet all applicable building codes and shall comply with section 50-26, adoption of life safety code.

L.

2.
