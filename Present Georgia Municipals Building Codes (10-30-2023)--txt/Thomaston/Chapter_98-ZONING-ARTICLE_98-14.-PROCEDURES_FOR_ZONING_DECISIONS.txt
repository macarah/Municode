A written point-by-point application of each of the standards in assessing the potential impact of the proposed special use shall be generated by the applicant.
1.
Whether the proposed special use will permit a use compatible with the current or future use of adjacent and nearby properties comprising the established land use pattern or a use that may adversely affect the existing or potential use of adjacent or nearby properties;
2.
Whether unacceptable impacts on the environment could be caused by the proposed special use, including, but not limited to, impacts on stormwater discharges, wetlands, groundwater recharge areas, wildlife habitats, soil erosion and sedimentation, floodplains, air quality, and water quality and quantity;

Sec. 98-14.12. - Special use approvals.
A.
It is hereby declared that certain uses have potentially serious damaging effects on public health, safety, and welfare. Accordingly, it is in the public interest to adopt heightened review and approval processes intended to minimize or prevent such adverse impacts that may comprise a blighting influence on surrounding properties and the Thomaston community. The purpose of this section, therefore, is to safeguard the public interest, to protect and enhance the quality of the environment and to promote public health, safety and welfare by pursuing the following objectives:
1.
Provide appropriate locations to accommodate the special uses listed in the respective zoning districts of this chapter.
2.
Support development compatible with surrounding uses thereby protecting residential property values and the investment of business owners.
B.
Special use approvals shall be transferable, provided that any expansion of a special use or conversion of an approved special use to a use allowed only as a special use shall require the filing of a new application to allow establishment or expansion of that special use.
C.
Any approval of a special use by the city council shall cease to be authorized and shall be terminated unless a building permit has been obtained within six months of the date the application for the special use was approved. The special use approval shall also be terminated in the event the approved construction has not been completed and approved by the building official as being consistent with all written commitments and conditions, the requirements of this chapter, and all applicable permits and a C.O. is issued within two years of the date the special use is approved by city council.
D.
Upon a determination by the building official that a special use is void and terminated pursuant to this section, the building official shall notify the applicant via certified mail return receipt requested or by hand delivery.

Sec. 98-14.13. - Conditional zoning.
A.
The zoning commission may recommend and city council may on its own motion assign conditions of zoning intended to mitigate potentially adverse impacts that may be associated with the proposed zoning classification of the property involved. Such conditions shall bear a reasonable relationship to the potentially adverse impact being mitigated.
B.
The process for deciding a conditional zoning shall be identical to the process for a property rezoning that requires public notice, a public hearing and application of the standards contained in subsection 98-14.10.1, standards of review applicable to amendments to the official zoning map. Removal of any conditions of zoning shall only be accomplished by the filing of a new rezoning application and favorable decision by city council.
C.
Any zoning of property that is subject to conditions assigned by city council shall be indicated on the official zoning map as the zoning district assigned to the property, followed by the letter "C," indicating the property is zoned "conditional." The ordinance associated with such a conditional zoning shall be indicated on the official zoning map and a copy maintained by the city clerk.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-14.14. - Properties zoned conditional remain subject to all other zoning provisions.
All property that is assigned conditions of zoning by city council shall continue to be subject to all other standards and provisions of the zoning ordinance that are not in conflict with such imposed conditions.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-14.15. - Permit issuance dependent on plan compliance with assigned conditions.
No building permit or other approvals concerning property that has been assigned conditions by city council shall be issued unless all plans and other submittals accompanying the application for a permit are drawn in compliance with such conditions. Such conditions shall be printed on the building plans and all civil drawings to ensure the conditions assigned by city council are incorporated into all such plans and drawings.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-14.16. - Reversion of zoning approval.
The following development milestones shall be considered in assessing the need for reversion of a property rezoning or approval of a special use:
A.
Failure of the applicant to obtain a building permit and commence bona fide development and substantial construction in accordance with city council approval of a rezoning application or a special use within 12 months of such approval may, at the sole discretion of city council, subject the property to reversion to the former zoning classification or a reversal of the special use approval. For purposes of this section, the term "development" shall be defined as having obtained a land disturbance permit or building permit, as appropriate, mobilized equipment and/or labor, and proceeded diligently with development of the property. The process for reversion of zoning approval or reversal of a special use approval shall be identical to a property rezoning. Such reversion or reversal shall require an affirmative zoning decision by city council and shall not be automatic.

98-14.18.1 Constitutional challenges to zoning and quasi-judicial decisions.
A.
This chapter has been adopted to ensure the public is afforded due process in an orderly manner to petition the courts for review of the city's exercise of zoning, administrative, and quasi-judicial powers as guaranteed by Article I, Section I, Paragraphs IX and XII of the Constitution, the General Assembly, pursuant to its authority under Article VI, Section IV, Paragraph I of the Constitution, provides the following mechanism by which each of the powers described in this chapter may be reviewed by the superior court of the county wherein such property that may be involved is located:
1.
Zoning decisions as defined in this chapter, being legislative in nature, shall be subject to direct constitutional challenge regarding the validity of maintaining the existing zoning on the subject property or the validity of conditions or an interim zoning category other than what was requested in the superior court pursuant to its original jurisdiction over declaratory judgments pursuant to [O.C.G.A. tit. 9, ch. 4] and equity jurisdiction under [O.C.G.A. tit. 23]. Such challenges shall be by way of a de novo review by the superior court wherein such review brings up the whole record from the local government and all competent evidence shall be admissible in the trial thereof, whether adduced in a local government process or not and employing the presumption that a governmental zoning decision is valid and can be overcome substantively by a petitioner showing by clear and convincing evidence that the zoning classification is a significant detriment to the petitioner and is insubstantially related to the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare; and
2.
Quasi-judicial decisions as defined in this chapter and zoning decisions under O.C.G.A. 36-66-3(4)(E) shall be subject to appellate review by the superior court pursuant to its appellate jurisdiction from a lower judicatory body and shall be brought by way of a petition for such review as provided for in [O.C.G.A. tit. 5]. Such matters shall be reviewed on the record which shall be brought to the superior court as provided in [O.C.G.A. tit. 5].
B.
All such challenges or appeals of zoning decisions as defined in section 98-14.1. Zoning decisions, generally, paragraph (A), shall be brought within 30 days of receipt of written notification of the decision of the challenged or appealed action.
C.
To ensure that the citizens of Georgia are not unnecessarily burdened by the review process as a mechanism of appeal, the city has designated the authority and procedures of the quasi-judicial body by ordinance or resolution.
