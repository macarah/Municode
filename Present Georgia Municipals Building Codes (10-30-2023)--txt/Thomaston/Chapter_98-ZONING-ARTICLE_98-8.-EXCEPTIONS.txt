ARTICLE 98-8. - EXCEPTIONS

Sec. 98-8.1. - Intent.
The following circumstances are found to be appropriate exceptions to the rules and standards of the ordinance. The purpose of such exceptions is to identify those circumstances where such deviation from specific standards of the ordinance is justified to account for unique circumstances associated with properties throughout the city. Such circumstances are generally the result of "faulty lot layout" in subdividing property and development of properties prior to adoption of modern zoning ordinances. In the absence of such exceptions, the alternate remedy for addressing unique circumstances would be a variance from the standards of the ordinance. The use of exceptions can ensure equal and more efficient treatment for owners of similarly situated properties that without the relief achieved through this exception provision or variances would experience undue hardship. The following exceptions are intended to grant such relief.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.2. - Substandard lot of record.
A.
Any lot of record existing on the effective date of this chapter having a lot area, lot width or both less than required by this chapter shall be subject to the following standards:
1.
Adjacent, nonconforming lots held in common ownership. When two or more adjacent and undeveloped lots having continuous frontage on the same side of the street are held in common ownership at the time of application for a building permit and the lot area, lot width or both is less than required by the zoning district in which the lots are located, such lots shall be re-platted and recorded as provided in chapter 78, subdivisions, of this Code to create one or more lots that comply with the minimum lot area and lot width standards of the respective zoning district, or for which a variance has been granted, prior to issuance of a building permit.
2.
Lots not meeting minimum development standards. When a lot has a lot area, lot width or both that does not conform to the standards of the zoning district in which the lot is located, but was a lot of record on the effective date of this chapter, such lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which such lot is located provided that all other standards of this chapter, including all yard setbacks are met or failing to be met, a variance from such standards is approved by the board of zoning appeals.
3.
No such substandard lot shall be developed prior to approval by the city manager.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.3. - Individual lot insufficient as to lot area.
A.
Where a lot is a lot of record on the effective date of this chapter and is located in an R-1 low density residential district or an R-2 medium density residential district does not conform to the minimum lot area, lot width or both standards of the zoning district assigned to the lot on the effective date of this chapter and such lot is not held in common by the owner of any adjacent lot, such lot may be used as a building site, provided all yard setbacks of the respective zoning district are met. In the event the yard setbacks cannot be met, the owner may seek a variance from the board of zoning appeals. Denial of an application for such variance by the board shall render the lot "unbuildable."
B.
No such substandard lot shall be developed prior to approval by the city manager.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.4. - Reduction of lot area.
Except as otherwise provided, no lot existing on the effective date of this chapter shall be reduced, subdivided, or otherwise altered to yield a lot that does not comply with the minimum standards of this chapter for the zoning district in which the lot is located unless such reduction or subdivision is necessary to provide land that is required and accepted for public use.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.5. - Landlocked lots.
In the event a landlocked lot exists as of the effective date of this chapter, the property owner shall be entitled to a single building permit, provided the following conditions are met:
A.
No other principal building exists or is under construction on the property.
B.
No other valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter and that is currently valid.
C.
The property has been under single ownership for a minimum of five years prior to the effective date of this chapter and continues to be under single ownership from the effective date of this chapter.
D.
The property owner has acquired a 30-foot access easement to a publicly maintained street, and said easement has been duly recorded and made a part of the property deed; and
E.
In the event the property is further subdivided, no additional building permits shall be issued.

Sec. 98-8.6. - Minimum street frontage.
With the exception of fee simple townhouses, condominiums, office condominiums and similar units, no building shall be erected on a lot that does not abut upon an open street for a minimum distance of 25 feet. Such street shall be a public street, a publicly maintained street, or a publicly approved street. The minimum street frontage for fee simple townhouses, condominiums, office condominiums and similar fee simple units shall be equal to or greater than the minimum lot width at the building setback line.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.7. - Minimum street frontage of a cul-de-sac lot.
The minimum street frontage on a cul-de-sac lot shall be 50 percent of the minimum lot frontage for the zoning district in which the lot is located, provided the minimum lot width at the building line shall be met.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.8. - Residential front yard setback responsive to the context.
A.
The front yard setback on a lot zoned for single family use and adjacent to developed residential lots shall be the average of the front yard setback of the two adjacent lots fronting on the same side of the street in the same block, and situated within the same zoning district, provided that no dwelling shall be placed less than ten feet from the front property boundary and no less than the front yard setback of any individual, adjacent lot. In the event only one dwelling is established on adjacent lots, the applicable front yard setback shall be no less than that of that one dwelling.
B.
No dwelling shall be placed on a front yard setback greater than 150 percent of the average front yard setback of the dwellings on the two, such adjacent lots.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.9. - Reduction in side yard.
Where a lot of record located in R-1 low density residential district or an R-2 medium density residential district does not meet the lot width standard established in the zoning district in which the lot is located, the applicable dimension of the side yard may be determined by the average side yards of two developed lots adjoining in either direction, along the same street frontage. In the event the side yard dimensions of the ordinance and those derived from the yard dimensions of the adjoining lots cannot be met, the owner may seek a variance from the board of zoning appeals. Denial of an application for such variance by the board shall render the lot "unbuildable."
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
Sec. 98-8.10. - Minimum lot area for infill development.

Sec. 98-8.12. - Maximum floor area.
A maximum floor area equal to 150 percent of the actual floor area of dwellings within 400 feet of the lot proposed for development on both sides of the street and situated in the same zoning district shall apply to new construction. For purposes of this section new construction shall include dwelling additions.
(Ord. No. 1166 , § 1(Exh. A), 4-5-22)
