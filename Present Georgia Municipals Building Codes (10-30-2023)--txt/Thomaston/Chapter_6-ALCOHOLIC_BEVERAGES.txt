i.
In the event two or more applicants for licenses under this section are both located less than the minimum distance required by state law (500 yards) from each other, that fact shall not disqualify either from the random drawing described hereinabove. If the second applicant's location is less than 500 yards from the first applicant's location, the second applicant shall have 60 days from the date of the drawing to find an alternate location that is 500 yards or greater from the first applicant's location. If either applicant that is eligible for issuance of a license does not meet all the requirements or he/she fails to pay the license fee when due then, the lottery position shall be deemed forfeited, and a license shall be offered to the applicant with the next lowest number. (For example, if applicant 1 and applicant 2 are drawn, but they are located less than the minimum distances required by state law from each other. Applicant 1 and 2 will be offered a license. Applicant 2 shall have 60 days to find another location that meets the distance requirements. If applicant 2 is unable to find another location within that time frame, applicant 2 will be deemed to have forfeited the number 2 lottery position and the license will be offered to applicant 3. If the location for applicant 1 and 2 meet the distance requirements, but either fails to pay the license fee within the required time, then the applicant failing to pay the license fee will be deemed to have forfeited their lottery position, and at that time a license will be offered to applicant 3.

That applicant shall pay the license fee to the city on or by 3:00 p.m. on the seventh day after a license is offered, and failure to do so shall result in forfeit of lottery position thereof. This process shall continue until two license fees are received by the city. The license fee shall be non-refundable.

If on December 31, 2022, no certificate of occupancy has been obtained, the license may be renewed for one additional year, and if the license is not renewed on or by December 31, 2022, it shall be deemed forfeited, thereby creating a vacancy as set forth subsection (8) of this section.

(c)
(1)
If any person or entity licensed under this chapter, or any employee or other person acting at the direction thereof, shall be cited or charged with any violation of this Code relating to the commercial distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages, then the agent of such person or entity may also be charged with the offense of serving as an agent of a licensee in violation of the same provision of this Code.
(2)
It shall be an element of the offense of serving as an agent of the licensee in violation of this chapter that the principal plead guilty or nolo contendere, or be convicted of the offense in question before the agent may be convicted. It shall also be an element of the offense that the agent in question directed, aided, participated in, ratified, or had knowledge of the actions underlying said violation; or that the agent in question had knowledge of the commission of a prior, similar violation committed by the same person, licensed entity, or employee within the previous calendar year. The maximum penalty for such offense shall be same as the maximum penalty of that offense for which the principal is convicted, but shall not include any term of incarceration, and may exceed the penalty actually imposed upon the principal.
(d)
If at any time while an application for a license is pending, or after any license has been issued under this chapter, a person named as agent under this section becomes unwilling or unable to serve as agent for any reason (including, without limitation, resignation, separation, death, disability, or incapacity), the licensee shall have ten business days in which to appoint a new agent, and to provide written notice of such change. Said written notice shall include, without limitation, information required of agents as part of an application for a new license (as set forth in subsection (a) of this section). The appointment of a new agent shall be made by filing a written notice to the City of Thomaston through its city manager or his/her designee, on an approved form. Until such time as written notice is properly filed as provided in this subsection, identifying the new agent, the mailing of any notice required to be given under this chapter to the most recent agent of record shall be sufficient notice to a licensee. The new agent shall furnish a complete set of fingerprints. The failure to appoint a new agent within ten business days of the date on which the previous agent actually ceased serving in the capacity as agent shall be grounds for revocation of any licenses issued under this chapter. The licensee shall provide information and supporting documentation that evidence the date upon which agent ceased servicing in the capacity as agent for the licensee.

(b)
"Due cause" for the suspension or revocation of any license shall consist of any of the following:
(1)
Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws.
(2)
Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any sex offense when the licensed business is for on-premises consumption.
(3)
Conviction of a violation of subsections (c), (f), or (g) of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-35 by an owner, operator, or employee of an alcohol licensee offering to the public any bona fide coin-operated amusement machine within the licensed establishment.
(4)
Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages.
(5)
Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented.
(6)
Any person to whom a license has been issued is no longer actively engaged in the dealing of alcoholic beverages (closure of the business for more than 90 consecutive days shall create a rebuttable presumption the licensee has abandoned the business).
(7)
Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this chapter as a condition or qualification for holding a license. Loss of qualifications during the term of a license shall be grounds for revocation or for denial of renewal.
(8)
Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.
(9)
The failure of the licensee to comply with the terms, provisions, requirements and responsibilities of this chapter. Current licensee, upon renewal, shall have a period of six months to comply with the any new terms, provisions, requirements and responsibilities that are created by the adoption hereof and which was not required by the previously adopted alcohol ordinance.

The hearing shall not be held sooner than three days from the receipt of this notice, and the notice shall set forth the date, time and place of the hearing on the matter. This notice shall also state the condition alleged which could, if sustained, result in suspension or revocation of licensee's license.
(d)
Hearings shall only be as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney or his designee shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. The licensee may be represented by legal counsel, may confront and cross-examine witnesses, and shall have the right to call witnesses and present evidence in his behalf. A hearing record shall be maintained by the city; however, either party may arrange for transcription by a court reporter at his sole expense. Hearings shall be presided over by the mayor who shall preserve order and rule upon all matter of evidence. Irrelevant, immaterial and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
(e)
Upon the second suspension or revocation of a license within any five-year period, as a prerequisite or reinstatement or reissuance of the license, the licensee, in addition to the requisite fees assessed under this article, licensee shall post a surety bond payable to the City of Thomaston, the amount of $5,000.00, conditioned upon the licensee maintaining the operation for which he is licensed in conformity with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. Upon any subsequent act giving due cause for suspension or revocation of the license, the bond shall be forfeited and license revoked.
(f)
Notwithstanding the options available to the city council to place on probation, suspend or revoke a license as set forth hereinabove, the city council may, in addition to placing on probation, suspending or revoking, in its discretion levy a fine upon the licensee in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation.
(g)
Within five business days following the hearing on this matter, the mayor and city council shall render a decision, notifying licensee in writing of its decision by mail or by personally delivering it to licensee. In the event of revocation, no refund shall be made on any portion of any license fee paid, and the establishment will cease to operate upon notification.
(h)
Following any decision denying an application for a license, or any decision for revoking or suspending an existing license, the applicant or licensee shall have the right to prompt judicial review in the manner provided by law.
(i)
Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 3-3-2.1, the city manager shall be required to provide notification to the Georgia Department of Revenue within 45 days of any officer, department, agency, or instrumentality of the municipality taking disciplinary action against any person issued a license to operate any premises at which 75 percent or more total gross annual revenue is derived from the sales of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
(j)
The notification required under subparagraph (j) above shall be in the format for the reporting of disciplinary actions established by the Georgia Department of Revenue.
(k)
For purposes of subparagraph (j), "disciplinary action" shall have the same meaning as provided for in O.C.G.A. § 3-3-2.1(a)(1), which includes any citation or arrest arising out of the violation of any law, rule, regulation, resolution, or ordinance of a governmental entity relating to the manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of alcoholic beverages against a licensee, any employee of a licensee, or any person holding a financial interest in the license of a licensee on the premises or place of business of any licensee.
