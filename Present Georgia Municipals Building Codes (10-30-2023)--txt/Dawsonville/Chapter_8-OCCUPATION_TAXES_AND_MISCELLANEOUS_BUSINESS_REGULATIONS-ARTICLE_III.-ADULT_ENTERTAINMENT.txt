DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 8-78. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse effect on property values, on the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, on its citizens and property and on the character of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protective form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhood through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
(b)
In addition thereto, it is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or entertainment including sexually oriented materials or entertainment. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or entertainment protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
