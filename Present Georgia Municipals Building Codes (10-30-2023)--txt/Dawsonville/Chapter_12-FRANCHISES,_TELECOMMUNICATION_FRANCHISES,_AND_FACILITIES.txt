(3)
Additional information requirements for towers.
a.
If the proposed site is zoned R-1 through R-3, R-VCR, R-A, R-MHT, R-MHP, R-PCD, or historic and there are alternative sites in C-CB, CH B, C-I R, C-OI, TB, or C-PCD, applicants must justify why those alternative sites have not been proposed. The city council will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The city council shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against the project's negative impacts at the proposed site.
b.
Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the city. Applicants must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. If collocation on any such towers would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the proposed tower, applicants must justify why such collocation is not being proposed. If collocation on any such tower would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. The city council will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The city council shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site.
c.
In all zones, applicants must demonstrate that they cannot provide personal wireless communication service without the use of a telecommunications tower.
d.
The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennas. The applicant shall provide a drawing for each tower showing existing and proposed antennas locations. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses; e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency, or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The city council shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means.
e.
The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage, and power lines impacting the proposed tower site.
(4)
The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by city council to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility.
(b)
Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant to section 12-58 and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, city council will expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within 14 business days after receipt of a complete application.
(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 9)
Sec. 12-57. - Appeals.
The decision of city council shall be final. However, the city council may affirm, reverse, or modify the action or decision previously rendered upon the applicant showing cause for change and/or providing additional information to city council in relation to any denial of a sign permit. Any appeal or request for reconsideration to the city council shall be in writing, shall state the reasons for the reconsideration, and shall be filed with the city clerk ten days prior to the next regularly scheduled city council meeting. Otherwise, any appeals from any decision of city council shall be made to the superior court of the county within 30 days of the decision.
(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 11)
Sec. 12-58. - Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district.
(a)
Restricted industrial districts. In restricted industrial (C-IR) zoning districts, micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 80 feet following design review by the city council and obtaining a building permit.

(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 6)
Sec. 12-59. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
(a)
Preferred location sites:
(1)
Collocation sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service, or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article, and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the city council to be visually obtrusive.
(2)
Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and, due to their institutional or infrastructure uses, are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles, and churches.
(3)
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings, i.e., housing above commercial or other residential space, are also preferred location sites.
(b)
Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multifamily duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 7)
Sec. 12-60. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
(a)
General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article.
(1)
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilitates, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the city council.
(2)
Regulatory compliance.
a.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
b.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation to the city showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
(3)
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
(4)
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA, or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary of air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(5)
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this article are met.
(6)
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below, or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(7)
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facilitate from adjacent public ways, public property, and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The city council may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms, or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the city council.
(8)
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of such local street.
(9)
Principal, accessory, and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage, or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
(10)
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities; provided, however, that the city council may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
1.
Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
2.
Towers, guy wires, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
3.
Telecommunications facilities must be set back from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 12-56.
b.
For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
(b)
Additional requirements for towers.
(1)
Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
(2)
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
(3)
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(4)
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable.
(5)
When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height.
(6)
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard, or side yard in a residential district.
(7)
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
(8)
Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
(9)
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design, and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 8)
Sec. 12-61. - Collocation.
Applicant and owner shall allow other future personal wireless service companies, including public and quasi-public agencies, using functionally equivalent personal wireless technology to collocate antennas, equipment, and facilities on a telecommunications facility unless specific technical constraints prohibit such collocation. The applicant and other person wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastructure and shall provide for equitable sharing of cost in accordance with industry standards.
(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 10)
Sec. 12-62. - Pre-existing towers/conforming uses.
(a)
All telecommunications facilities operative on October 7, 1997, shall be allowed to continue their present usage. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this article.
(b)
A telecommunications facility that has received city approval as of October 7, 1997, in the form of a building permit, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired.
(c)
Placement of an antenna on a conforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the conforming structure.
(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 15)
Sec. 12-63. - Abandoned towers.
(a)
Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state, or otherwise, which may have been granted.
(b)
If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.
(Ord. of 10-7-1997, § 14)
Sec. 12-64. - Nuisances.
Telecommunications facilities, including, without limitation, power source, ventilation, and cooling, shall not be operated so as to cause the generation of heat that adversely affects a building occupant and shall not be maintained or operated in such a manner as to be a nuisance.
