Sec. 2-173. - Purchases and expenditures, procedure.
modified
(a)
Nonbudgeted purchases:
(1)
The city council fully understands and identifies that every event cannot be foreseen, but the city council also understands that the budget is the basis for the city's financial actions for each respective fiscal year. As such, nonbudgeted purchases must be kept at a bare minimum, and need to undergo the closest scrutiny to determine how necessary each nonbudgeted purchase may be.
(2)
When a division head determines the necessity to purchase a nonbudgeted operating or capital item he/she must justify this need to the city.
(3)
The city manager shall notify mayor and council of any nonbudgeted capital purchases he has authorized in excess of $3,000.00 at a regular meeting and shall obtain formal ratification of said action from mayor and council.
(b)
Budgeted purchases:
(1)
The city hereby establishes a centralized purchasing system where all city purchases will be coordinated by the city manager's office subject to the regulations outlined herein.
(2)
The city manager shall be responsible for implementing and enforcing all purchasing rules and regulations and will maintain and distribute to all eligible vendors purchasing rules and regulations as may be written specifically for those vendors.
(3)
The city manager shall establish internal procedures for review of all proposed expenditures to be known as the encumbrance process. The encumbrance process shall have the effect of reserving city funds to cover authorized purchases made within approved appropriations levels based on a modified accrual basis of accounting.
(c)
The encumbrance process:
(1)
It shall be the policy of the city that all purchasing be done in a competitive environment with qualified vendors being given a reasonable opportunity to do business with the city.
(2)
In order to initiate a purchase, an employee must complete the city requisition form, sign it and forward it to their division head for approval. The completed requisition form must have the cost of each product or item noted on the form. If approved, the division head or designee shall sign the requisition form, identify and indicate the accounting code (budgeted line item) for this expense and forward it to the city manager's office for processing. If the actual cost of the purchase is lower than that indicated, the correction will be made to the original purchase order by the finance division. Purchases over $1,000.00 shall require the specific approval of the city manager.
(3)
A purchase order shall be initiated; thus encumbering the specific line item appropriation to be charged with the transaction. In the event there are insufficient funds left within the cited accounting code (budgeted line item), the purchase order shall not be issued and the requisition form shall be returned to the respective division head.
(d)
Purchase orders:
(1)
All purchases require division head or designee approval.
(2)
Budgeted purchases of less than $150.00 shall not require a purchase order. However, such purchases shall be documented with proper evidence (ticket, invoice, receipt) and with specific approval of the purchase by the applicable division head. Said approval will also reflect assignment of the purchase to the appropriate divisional budget line item number. Purchases made under this category are to be made on a competitive basis unless the city has an established purchasing contract (blanket purchase order) with the applicable vendor.
(3)
All budgeted purchases over $150.00 shall be accompanied by a purchase order. The purchase order must include a P.0. number, the name of the vendor, the name or a description of the item or service being purchased, and the actual or estimated cost of the item or service. Purchase orders for purchases less than $1,000.00 shall be made as field purchase orders within the division. (A field purchase order is one that is issued by an operating division and does not require executive review and approval.) Copies of field purchase orders must be forwarded to the finance division promptly after issuance for encumbrance purposes. Purchase orders over $1,000.00 shall be obtained from the purchasing department and approved by the city manager's office after the purchase has been approved in the process described above
(4)
The general administration division shall reject payment of any purchase over $150.00 that does not include an authorized purchase order; that exceeds budgetary limitations, or is not authorized by the budget. Exceptions to this rule are routine purchases such as city's utility payments, professional services rendered, etc.
(5)
Bonafide emergencies as set forth in wording under subsection (f)(1) shall be an exception to the encumbrance process.

For any purchase in excess of $150.00 where a blanket purchase order was not in effect the division head must provide written documentation of their efforts to obtain at least three verbal or written quotes or bids for each purchase. Documentation of competitive pricing based on common specifications will be attached to the requisition and all associated paperwork, including the invoice.
b.
Purchases between $1,000.00 and $25,000.00. The division head, together with the city manager, shall authorize purchases between $1,000.00 and $25,000.00. All purchases of less than $5,000.00 shall require informal (nonadvertised, nonsealed) bids. These may be verbal or facsimile as long as written documentation of the competitive pricing and bidding process is attached to the purchase order requisition and other associated paperwork, including standard specifications or requirements, if applicable. A minimum of three bids must be obtained from qualified vendors who regularly offer or carry the items or services to be purchased. All purchases greater than $5,000.00 but less than $10,000.00 shall require a formal bidding process to at a minimum include advertisement for a minimum of one week on the city website and the solicitation of local bids from qualified bidders. All purchases greater than $10,000.00 but less than $25,000.00 shall require formal sealed bids and must at minimum include advertisement on the city's website for two weeks and in the county organ (presently, The Post-Searchlight) at least one time no less than one week prior to the date and the time of public bid opening.
c.
Purchases over $25,000.00. Any purchase in excess of $25,000.00 shall be approved/awarded by the mayor and city council in a regular or special meeting, unless it is made under a City of Bainbridge, state or federal G.S.A. negotiated contract purchasing system. Such purchases shall require formal competitive sealed bids, advertised in the county organ (presently, The Post-Searchlight) at least one time no less than one week prior to the date and the time of public bid opening, in accordance with state law. In addition, the city shall advertise the purchasing opportunity on the city website for a minimum of 21 days and make other reasonable efforts to make qualified vendors aware of the purchasing opportunity, including direct notification of potential vendors in the Bainbridge area. Purchases in this category must be based on standard specifications that allow maximum competition among qualified vendors whose products or services meet established performance requirements.
(2)
It is the policy of the city that any purchase that binds the city by contract shall be approved/awarded by the mayor and council in a regular or special called meeting, irrespective of the value or the amount of the contract.
(3)
Additionally, no item shall be determined a sole source purchase without the approval of the city manager. In this case, there must be full documentation of the lack of a competitive market submitted to the city manager and/or mayor and city council, as applicable.
(4)
It is the policy of the city that the above purchasing limitations and authority guidelines be followed in all circumstances. Under no circumstances should purchases be split or divided to avoid established bid limits.
(5)
Upon not receiving any sealed bids following two lawfully advertised bids, and following approval by the mayor and council, the city manager shall be authorized without additional advertisement to seek and obtain sealed competitive bids from at least three vendors who commonly deal in such supplies, materials, equipment or vehicles. No purchase in excess of $25,000.00 shall be authorized to be purchased in this method. Further, this policy shall not be applicable to public works projects, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-1 et seq.
(6)
It is the policy of the city that all purchases in excess of $3,000.00 shall be reported to the city council during a regularly scheduled meeting of the city council.
(f)
Emergency purchases.

Local procurement preference. There is hereby established the following local procurement preference in purchasing. In any case where purchases made pursuant to this policy are made under the provisions permitting purchase without obtaining bids or competitive quotations, an effort shall be made to solicit prices from local vendors or suppliers where available. Nothing herein shall require that a purchase be made locally. In all cases consideration must be given to cost, quality of goods, past service performance, availability of goods and delivery time. Where purchases are made by obtaining competitive quotations, or by a bidding process, whenever a supplier who meets the qualifications in subsection (a) above submits a quotation or a bid that is responsive and is within two percent of the lowest responsive bid or quote, such supplier shall be afforded the opportunity to match the bid or quote. Should such supplier agree to match the lowest responsible bid or quote, the purchase shall be made from such supplier, provided such supplier is otherwise qualified. In cases where more than one local bidder is within two percent of the lowest responsive bid or quote the lowest local bidder shall be first be given the opportunity to match the low bid. If this bidder declines to match the price; the city will proceed in order from lowest to highest until all qualifying local bidders are eliminated.
