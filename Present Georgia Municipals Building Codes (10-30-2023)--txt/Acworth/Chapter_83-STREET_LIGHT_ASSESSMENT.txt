Chapter 83 - STREET LIGHT ASSESSMENT
ARTICLE I. - STREET LIGHTS

Sec. 83-1. - Street light district.
(a)
Authority: The governing authority of the City of Acworth is granted supplementary powers pursuant to Ga. Const. Art. IX, § II, ¶ 3(a)(4) to provide street light services within corporate limits. Further, the City is granted powers with respect to its municipal street system to provide lighting on any public road located within its corporate limits. O.C.G.A. § 32-4-92 . Further, Ga. Const. Art. IX, § II, ¶ VI permits the City to create a special assessment for the provision of local government services within such district and allows a fee to be collected within such district to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such services therein. Such special assessment may be created and fees collected by municipal ordinance.
(b)
Purpose: The governing authority of the City of Acworth does hereby declare that it shall promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city by providing for street lights in public rights-of-way. The governing authority of the City finds that it is in the best interest of the citizens of Acworth and to those visiting the City of Acworth that the city provide a street light system that is functional, operational, aesthetically pleasing and uniform throughout the city. The maintenance of street lights in the public rights of way provides illumination for vehicular and pedestrian commuters in the city to navigate and travel to and from their respective destinations along and across the public rights of way during non-daylight hours. Further, street lights provide illumination for citizens to access (ingress and egress) and frequent commercial and residential establishments within the city during non-daylight hours. Further, the illumination provided by street lights during non-daylight hours may help to reduce crime by discouraging criminal behavior in areas that are lighted throughout areas of the city. The city finds that the cost to provide street lights within the city rights-of-way should be borne by all property owners that receive the public benefit of street lights citywide.

Upon the de-annexation of any territory out of the city, the boundaries of the street light services shall be reduced to exclude the territory so de- annexed and all territory so de-annexed shall thereafter not be subject to the terms of this chapter.
(e)
Cost: The governing authority of the city does hereby declare that the cost for the creation and maintenance of the street light assessment shall be a service, as authorized by Ga. Const. Art. IX, § II, ¶ VI, and not a tax.
