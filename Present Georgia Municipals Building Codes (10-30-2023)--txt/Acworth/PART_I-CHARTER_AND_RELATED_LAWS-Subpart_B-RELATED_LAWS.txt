(h)
The revenue bonds or obligations herein authorized to be issued shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the City of Acworth within the meaning of Ga. Const. art. IX, § VII, ¶ I, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said city, nor shall the city be subject to any pecuniary liability thereon. The revenue bonds shall not be payable from, nor a charge upon, any funds of the city. Any bondholder shall have the right to compel the authority to levy the special tax herein provided for within the limit herein prescribed to pay the bonds and interest thereon; provided, however, that any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds or any trust agreement, trust indenture, or similar agreement approved by the authority may provide that no bondholder shall have any such right to compel levy of a tax, and, in that event, the authority may not and shall not levy any tax to pay the bonds which are the subject of any such resolution, trust agreement, trust indenture, or similar agreement or interest thereon.
(i)
The authority is hereby authorized to issue revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations from time to time to carry out the purposes of this paragraph. Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations so issued shall be paid solely from the revenues pledged to the payment thereof, which revenues may include any funds derived from the special tax levy provided hereunder. Such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body of the authority, which may be adopted at a regular or special meeting by a majority vote of the members of said governing body. The governing body of said authority in determining the cost of any project for which revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations are to be issued may include all costs relative to the issuance thereof and, without intending to limit such costs, may include architectural, engineering, inspection, fiscal agents', and legal expenses estimated to accrue from the date of any revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations through the period of construction and for six months after such construction; and such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding 30 years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or rates, and may be in such denominations and may carry such registration privileges and be subject to redemption and may contain such terms, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations may provide. Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations and interest thereon so issued by said authority are hereby declared to be tax exempt for any and all purposes. The terms, conditions, covenants, and provisions contained in any such resolution authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind said governing body then in office and its successors thereof, including any covenant to levy taxes within the limits herein prescribed for the purpose of providing such funds as may be necessary to pay the principal of and interest on any such issue or issues of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations and to create and maintain a reserve for that purpose. Such bonds, but not notes or other obligations, issued by said authority shall be validated in the Superior Court of Cobb County in the same manner as revenue bonds of municipalities are validated as provided under the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, p. 761), as amended. There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which the authority may issue. The interest rate or rates on or to be borne by any revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by the authority shall be determined by the members of the authority; and any limitations with respect to interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates found in the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, p. 761), as amended, the usury laws of the State of Georgia, or any other laws of the State of Georgia shall not apply to revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority issued pursuant to this paragraph. The members of the authority for purposes of the Revenue Bond Law shall constitute the "governing body," as that term is used herein.
(j)
For purposes of validation of revenue bonds as provided under the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, p. 761), as amended, the authority shall be considered to be located in the City of Acworth, Cobb County, Georgia.
(k)
The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds issued by it which shall be lost, mutilated, or destroyed.
(l)
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of bonds pursuant to this paragraph may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a trustee, which may be any trust company, any bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the state, any national banking association organized under the laws of the United States, or an individual. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, rents, receipts, earnings, or other funds to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the authority, either real or personal. The resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders may enforce their rights. Such resolution or trust indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects satisfactory to the trustee or to the bondholders, and may also require that the security given by any contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such trustee or bondholders, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued pari passu with the revenue bonds initially issued pursuant to such resolution or trust indenture. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state or any national banking association organized under the laws of the United States to act as such depository and to furnish such security as may be required by the authority. All expenses incurred in connection with any such resolution or trust indenture may be treated as operating expenses of the authority. This subparagraph is illustrative and does not limit the types of instruments which may secure or provide for any issue of bonds or the terms and provisions which any resolution adopted by the authority or any instrument executed by the authority may contain. Any resolution adopted by the authority or any indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument executed by the authority may contain such terms and provisions as the authority shall approve. Such approval of the authority shall be conclusively established by the execution of any such resolution, indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument by the chairman or vice-chairman of the authority and the attestation of such execution by the secretary or any assistant secretary of the authority. Nothing herein shall be construed to require, for any issue of revenue bonds, a trustee or a trust indenture, trust agreement, or similar instrument.
(m)
In addition to and not in limitation of other powers granted in this paragraph as to the issuance of revenue bonds and security for such bonds, the authority shall have the power to enter into any financial and contractual arrangements which it deems appropriate with users or owners of projects in order to provide security to bondholders; and for such purposes it may also enter into joint agreements, arrangements, or trust indentures with such users or owners and a trustee or trustees under any trust indenture in order that funds may be procured to accomplish the purposes of this paragraph.
(n)
While any of the revenue bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds.
(o)
All revenue bonds of the authority issued under the provisions of this paragraph are declared to be issued for an essential public purpose and the said bonds and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within the state.
