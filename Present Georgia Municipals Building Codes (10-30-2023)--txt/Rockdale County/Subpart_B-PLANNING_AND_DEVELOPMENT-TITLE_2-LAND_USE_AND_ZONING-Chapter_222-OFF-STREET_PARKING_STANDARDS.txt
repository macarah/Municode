Sec. 222-3. - Reduction in minimum parking requirements.
(a)
Shared parking may be permitted by the director if the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that the actual peak parking requirements of the proposed development or use can be satisfied with a lesser number of parking spaces through sharing adjacent parking for two or more proximate uses because peak demand periods for proposed land uses do not occur at the same time periods.
(b)
Developers requesting reductions based on shared parking shall submit the following to the director for review at the time of submitting a preliminary plat or site development plan for the project:
(1)
Site plan indicating the location of uses proposing to share parking requirements and design of shared parking facilities.
(2)
Names and addresses of the owner(s) and uses that share parking.
(3)
Location and number of parking shared spaces.
(4)
If there is more than one owner, submit a cross-access legal agreement between owners to assure the continued availability of adequate parking.
(5)
A shared parking analysis that shall follow the procedures detailed in the paragraph below.
(c)
The procedures for determining parking requirements in a mixed use development are:
(1)
Determine the minimum amount of parking required for each separate use described in the table of minimum parking requirements.
(2)
Multiply the parking requirement for each use by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods in the table of parking ratios by use and time of day for mixed-use developments.
(3)
Sum the total parking requirements for all uses for each of the five time periods in the table of parking ratios by use and time of day for mixed-use developments.
(4)
The parking requirement for the time period having the largest required total number of parking spaces based on use of table of parking ratios by use and time of day for mixed-use developments shall be the minimum required number of parking spaces for the mixed-use development.

  (d)
Any subsequent change in land uses within the participating developments shall require proof that adequate parking will be available. Prior to any change in ownership or use, the owner must apply to the director for an evaluation and confirmation of the reduction. If the director finds that the parking reduction is no longer justified, the director shall notify the owner to construct the number of parking spaces necessary to meet the required level.
(e)
On-street parking. Up to 50 percent of the on-street parking spaces available within 600 feet of a use may be counted towards the minimum off-street parking requirements, provided that the same parking space cannot be used to contribute to the off-street parking requirements of by more than one parcel. No more than 25 percent of the number of required off-street parking spaces may be provided by on-street parking.
(f)
Administrative variance. The director shall have the authority to grant a reduction in the total number of off-street parking spaces by up to 20 percent of the number required by the table of minimum parking requirements through administrative variance. Such administrative variance requires review and approval of the applicant's written documentation and justification that one or more of the following conditions exist:
(1)
Because of unique circumstances including the shape, topography, soils and vegetation of the site, the provision of the minimum number of required spaces would cause the applicant to suffer unique and undue hardship.
(2)
The site is located in an environmentally sensitive area, such as a water supply watershed, where stormwater runoff should be minimized.
(3)
The unique circumstances of the use make the minimum number of parking spaces excessive for actual needs.
(g)
Landscaped reserve. Where it can be demonstrated that a use or establishment will temporarily need a lesser number of parking spaces than is required (such as phased occupancy of large new facilities or eventual succession of a new use), the number of such spaces required may be reduced by not more than 50 percent, subject to the site plan approval, provided that the following requirements are met:
(1)
The applicant shall submit documentary evidence to the planning and development director that the use will temporarily justify a lesser number of spaces for a period of time not less than one year.
(2)
A reserve area provided shall be sufficient to accommodate the difference between the spaces required and the lesser number provided. Said reserve area shall:
a.
Be inclusive of all associated parking spaces, drive aisles, access routes, transition slopes, and infrastructure.
b.
Not encroach upon or directly drain to any water body, wetland, undisturbed buffer, impervious setback, floodplain, or other environmentally sensitive area.
(3)
Said reserved area shall be maintained exclusively as landscaped area and shall be clearly indicated as "Reserve Parking Area" on the site plan.
(4)
The landscaping may either consist of existing natural vegetation or be developed as a new landscaped area, whichever is granted site plan approval.
(5)
No structure, mechanical equipment, material stockpile, or trash may be placed in the landscaped reserve; and no parking shall be allowed within the landscaped reserve until developed as a parking lot.
(6)
Said reserve area shall not be counted toward the minimum open space required by lot coverage provisions of this section.
(7)
When in the opinion of the planning director additional parking is required, said reserve area may be required to be developed as a parking lot.
(8)
A separate land disturbance permit shall be required for any modification to the reserve area regarding its location, size, use, configuration, or impervious coverage.
