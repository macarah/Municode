Unless otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful to place in or on any private property any handbill, circular, pamphlet, poster, postcard or other literature, except with the prior permission, expressed or implied, of the owner of the property or intended recipient.
(b)
Distribution of any literature shall be lawful without the prior permission of the property owner or intended recipient if the literature is sent by mail or if the organization or individual distributing the literature has registered with the county department of buildings and inspections on a form approved by the board of commissioners and a permit is issued thereto for each person distributing the literature. That person shall carry the permit with him when distributing the literature and shall exhibit the permit to any person requesting it. Civic, political and religious organizations shall be exempt from the permit requirement but registration shall still be required.
