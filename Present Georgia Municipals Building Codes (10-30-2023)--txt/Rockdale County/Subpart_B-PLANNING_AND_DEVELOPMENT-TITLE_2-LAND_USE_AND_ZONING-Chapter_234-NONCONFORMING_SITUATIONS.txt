Chapter 234 - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS

Sec. 234-1. - Statement of intent and purpose.
Within the districts established by Title 2, or in other UDO provisions or amendments, there exist lots, uses of land, uses of land and buildings, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of buildings and structures that were lawful before the UDO was adopted or amended, but that would be prohibited under the terms of the UDO or future amendment. Such nonconforming situations are hereby declared to be incompatible with authorized and permitted uses and regulations within the district(s) involved. It is the intent of the county to require the cessation of certain of these nonconformities, and to allow others to continue, on a limited basis, until they are otherwise removed or cease. It is further the county's intent that nonconformities not be used as grounds for adding other buildings, structures, or uses of land prohibited by the UDO, and that no such building, structure, or use of land shall be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of non-conformity.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
Sec. 234-2. - Nonconforming use of land.
The nonconforming use of land may be continued, but no such nonconforming use of land which has been discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months shall be reestablished unless such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the property. Such nonconforming use of land shall not be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 0-2013-11, § I, 11-12-2013)
Sec. 234-3. - Nonconforming lot of record.
A legal nonconforming lot of record in a residential district may be used for one single-family residence.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
Sec. 234-4. - Nonconforming use of land and buildings in combination and nonconforming use of land and structures in combination.
The following regulations apply to the nonconforming use of land and building(s) in combination and the nonconforming use of land and structure(s) in combination:
(a)
Such uses of land and buildings or land and structures may be continued, but no such use which has been discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months shall be reestablished unless such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the property.
(b)
Such uses of land and buildings or land and structures, or any such building or structure, shall not be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity.
(c)
A nonconforming use of a building may be extended into those interior parts of a building which were manifestly designed for such use prior to the enactment of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006; Ord. No. 0-2013-11, § II, 11-12-2013)
Sec. 234-5. - Nonconforming characteristics of buildings and structures.
No building or structure with nonconforming characteristics which is occupied by a conforming use shall be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity.
(Ord. No. 0-2006-32, §§ 1—3, 11-28-2006)
Sec. 234-6. - Nonconforming uses requiring special use permit.
No nonconforming use, building or structure requiring a special use permit under the terms of Title 2, including any use, building or structure that was authorized as of right prior to the adoption of this chapter but would require a special use permit upon the adoption of the UDO, shall be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner except after application for and approval of the now-required special use permit. Normal repair and maintenance of buildings and structures is authorized without the need for a special use permit. No such use, building, or structure that has been discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months shall be reestablished unless such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the property.

Sec. 234-7. - Reconstruction.
(a)
Any building or structure constituting a nonconforming use of land and building(s), nonconforming use of land and structure(s), or building or structure with nonconforming characteristics that has been damaged by fire or other cause, may be reconstructed to its previous nonconforming characteristics and used as it was prior to damage if said reconstruction is completed within one year of the date of the damage, except that if said building or structure has been declared by the director to have been damaged to an extent exceeding 60 percent of its fair market value at the time of destruction, then any repair, reconstruction or new construction shall conform to all of the requirements of the district in which said building or structure is located.
(b)
Provided, however, a building which housed or houses a detached or attached single-family residential nonconforming use may be reoccupied by the same use after it has been damaged to the extent of 60 percent or more of the total fair market value of the building only as a matter of right in all zoning districts.
