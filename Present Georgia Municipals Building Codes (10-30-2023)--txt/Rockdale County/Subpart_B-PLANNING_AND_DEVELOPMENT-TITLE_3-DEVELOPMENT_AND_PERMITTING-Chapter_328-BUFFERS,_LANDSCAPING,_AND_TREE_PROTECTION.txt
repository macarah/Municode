Sec. 328-21. - Density requirements.
(a)
The quantity of total existing and replacement trees and landscaping on a site must be sufficient so as to produce a total site density of not less than that required by section 328-24 or section 328-25 for all developments.
(b)
The required density shall not include required tree and landscape plantings such as required buffers, transitional buffers, and/or vegetative screenings. Such buffers may include but are not limited to state waters buffers, required landscape buffers and/or planted non-access easements. The required density is in addition to all required plantings.
(c)
The tree density factor shall be calculated using the total acreage from disturbed areas. Trees to be used in calculating density should be distributed throughout the development in nodes rather than as individual trees. (See administrative standards for specifications.)
(d)
Required landscape areas shall be defined as a minimum of twelve (12) percent of the total buildable area in any parcel, not including required buffers or landscape strips. Such landscape areas shall be designed in order to enhance any buildings on the site.
(e)
All required landscape areas shall be planted with a combination of trees, shrubs, perennials, groundcover, and grass, as approved by the director. Landscape areas shall be designed with a minimum 40 percent coverage in trees and large shrubs. Small shrubs, perennials, ornamental grasses, and groundcover may constitute no more than 35 percent coverage of the landscape area, and sod may constitute no more than 25 percent coverage of the landscape area. The following sizes shall be used when calculating coverage of the landscape materials:
a.
Trees greater than six-inch caliper: 100 ft.
b.

(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008; Ord. No. 0-2016-03, § VIII, 4-26-2016)
Sec. 328-22. - Tree protection standards.
(a)
This section establishes standards by which plans and field conditions are to be site evaluated in order to determine compliance with the provisions of this article.
(1)
Protection of existing trees. If trees exist on the site, the required density (see section 328-21) should be met with those trees. If this cannot be done, replacement trees shall be required. A landscape and tree protection and replacement plan must be a part of the approved land disturbance plan. When a choice is available as to which existing trees to save, exceptional trees should be given preference over other trees. Non-exceptional trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site.
(2)
Tree inventories and surveys. All trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried. On sites two acres or less, all trees need to be individually counted. All exceptional trees and critical root zones must be shown on the tree protection and replacement plan with an indication whether they are to be retained or removed. On sites greater than two acres, all trees counted must be inventoried using a sampling method. Exceptional trees to be saved as well as the critical root zone must be shown for trees outside of the tree save areas. Exceptional tree calculations can be done using sampling. Sampling method must be approved and overseen by county forester.
(3)
Plan review standards. All tree save areas must be delineated on the tree protection and replacement plan with tree protection fencing during all phases of construction. The method used to inventory the trees must be indicated on the plans. All buffers must be identified on the tree protection and replacement plan.
(4)
Construction standards. Tree protection fences are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including but not limited to:
a.
Soil compaction in the critical root zone from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials.
b.
Root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching.
c.
Wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs.
d.
Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc.
(5)
Location and types of tree protection fencing. Tree protection fences are to be installed as shown on the tree protection and replacement plan and shall be located outside of the critical root zone of all exceptional trees to be preserved. Once tree protection areas are established and approved, any changes to such areas are subject to review and approval by the county forester.
(6)
Materials. Tree protection fencing shall consist of four-foot wide orange laminated plastic fencing. Tree protection fencing specifications may be found in the administrative standards promulgated pursuant to this article.
(7)
Sequence of installation and removal. All tree protection fencing shall be installed prior to the commencement of any land disturbing activity. The county forester shall inspect the installation of tree protection fencing. It shall be the joint and several responsibility of the property owner, developer, contractor, and builder, as applicable, to ensure that all tree protection fencing remains in place during all phases of development.
(8)
Other specifications. Where the clearing of trees has been approved as part of a tree protection and replacement plan, trees shall be removed in a manner that does not adversely impact the trees to be preserved. No trees shall be felled into tree protection areas and no roots shall be disturbed inside the tree protection areas. All erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be installed uphill so that sediment will not reach any tree protection fencing. All tree protection areas for commercial developments shall be designated as such with "Tree Protection Area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process.
(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008; Ord. No. 0-2016-03, § IX, 4-26-2016)
Sec. 328-23. - Tree replacement and landscape standards.
(a)
This section establishes standards by which landscape and tree protection and replacement plans and field conditions are to be evaluated to determine compliance with the provisions of this article.
(1)
Tree protection and replacement plans shall be prepared with appropriate consideration given to the function of trees in the urban landscape. Every effort should be made to maximize the environmental benefit of the plant material.
(2)
Trees selected for planting must be from the approved tree list (available on the Rockdale County website), #1 quality, free from trunk or root injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. Landscaping materials selected for planting must be from the approved shrub and groundcover lists (available on the Rockdale County website), and must also be free from defects. Whenever appropriate, all landscaped areas shall utilize existing natural vegetation in an undisturbed state.
(3)
Required comments and standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publications, "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual", "The Practical Science of Planting Trees", or similar publication. Reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60, -2014) for plant material quality specifications. The location of plant materials shall be such that developers incorporate landscaping design that enhances the aesthetics of the property in keeping with the planned use.
(4)
Tree planting standards.
a.
Always pick a tree up by the container or root ball, never by the trunk.
b.
The hole shall be a minimum of two times the width of the root ball with sloped sides.
c.
The depth of the hole should be no deeper than the height between the bottom of the root ball and the trunk flare.
d.
Once the tree is placed in the hole, all strapping plus the upper half of burlap and wire basket must be removed from the top of the root ball.
e.
Backfill soil must be watered and all air pockets removed and filled with clean dirt.
f.
Stake the tree only if necessary.
g.
All requirements of the planting comments and planting detail will be followed.
(5)
Species. Species selected as replacement trees must be native to the Piedmont Region of Georgia and selected from the county's most recent approved tree list, and be ecologically compatible with the site where they are to be planted. A mix of trees with no more than 25 percent of one genus is acceptable for meeting density requirements. Landscaping materials must be ecologically compatible with the site where they are to be planted, and a mix of shrubs with no more than 25 percent of one genus is acceptable for meeting density requirements.
(6)
Minimum root zones. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees within tree islands, the minimum root zone of 170 square feet is required for all trees. No utility lines shall be located within 15 feet of required tree planting location(s) unless approved by the director.
(7)
No disturbed ground shall be left exposed. All exposed ground shall be covered with grasses, shrubs, and/or trees to meet the minimum density requirements stated in 328-21(e).

The landscape and tree protection and replacement plan must, at a minimum, protect ten units per acre of existing dominant and co-dominant trees. When possible those protected trees should be evenly distributed over the site.
(1)
If sufficient existing dominant and co-dominant trees are not available for protection, then two two-inch caliper shade trees shall be required per buildable lot.
(2)
The county forester may reduce the ten unit per acre requirement by up to 50 percent if he determines that a hardship exists due to existing topographical or other physical conditions not caused by the property owner.
(3)
If sufficient existing dominant and co-dominant trees are available but are removed without appropriate review and approval of the county forester then ten replacement density factor units per acre shall be required for recompense.
(c)
Tree protection and replacement plans must, in addition to complying with the requirements of subsection (b) above, comply with either of the following:
(1)
Each buildable lot with septic tank and drain field shall have a minimum of two two-inch caliper minimum shade trees, planted or preserved. Each buildable lot serviced by sewer shall have three two-inch caliper shade trees, planted or preserved. All trees shall be at least 15 feet from any utility line, septic tank and drain field. Roots within the critical root zone of preserved trees shall remain undisturbed or the tree will not be counted. All trees shall be planted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(2)
The developer and builder shall protect at least 15 units per acre of existing vegetation and trees on the land being developed in addition to already required buffers and landscape strips. The tree density calculations shall not utilize trees within required buffers in determining for the overall density factor, existing density factor, or replacement density factor. Such buffers may include but are not limited to; state waters buffers, required landscape buffers and/or planted non-access easements. The intent is to clear for the road(s) and utility infrastructure only.
No reduction from the requirements of this subsection shall be authorized except as otherwise permitted in accordance with the provisions of section 328-29.
(d)

Rockdale County has given priority to the retention and placement of trees in frontage planting strips and parking lot planting islands. Trees retained or placed in these areas may be used to meet the tree density factor for a project. However, if the tree density factor is met with trees saved or planted in other areas, the tree location guidelines outlined below must still be performed with additional tree plantings.
(d)
Required landscape strips and re-vegetated buffers. Landscape strips shall meet the minimum depth requirements as indicated in the following table. Trees may be planted in groups rather than in a single line. Adjoining residential zoning districts, evergreen trees shall be saved or planted in such density or spacing as to provide an eight-foot tall visual barrier within two years of planting. Required landscaping strips shall not be encroached upon by parking space, driveway surfaces or storm water detention facilities except when complying with requirements below. Driveway crossings may traverse such strip as near to a perpendicular alignment as practical. Signs may be located in the required landscape strip.

  (e)
Parking landscape islands. Landscape islands shall be provided within parking areas (but not within vehicle storage, maneuvering, or display areas) as follows:
(1)
Landscape islands shall be located at the end of every parking bay, such that no more than eight (8) parking spaces occur in an unbroken row. Measuring from the trunk, the tree must be a minimum of six feet from the back of the curb. No portion of an island less than three feet in width may be counted. All landscape islands shall contain a minimum of 200 square feet. Parking lot interior landscaping is not required beneath canopies or other structures that block sunlight or rainfall.
(2)
Landscape islands shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the parking area. A planting area located wholly within a generally rectangular area that is (a) devoted to parking and (b) between a building and a lot line or between two buildings will generally serve this purpose.
(3)
At least one tree shall be planted in every landscape island, with no less than 200 square feet per tree. There shall be at least one overstory tree for every eight parking spaces.
(4)
Adequate irrigation to the landscape island shall be provided. The method of irrigation shall be indicated on the tree protection and replacement plan.
(5)
Light posts and underground utilities shall not be located in landscape islands.
(6)
Combination drainage swale/planting strips for parking lots are encouraged provided that:
a.
Adequate drainage is provided for the trees and plants; and
b.
Bottomland hardwood species are used.
(f)
Any person developing a lot for which a landscape and tree replacement and protection plan has been approved by the county shall be required to comply with the provisions of that approved plan.
(g)
The county forester shall inspect all tree and landscape plantings. The county forester shall file a written report with the department detailing and certifying the completion of all required tree plantings as required in the plans. The report must be received by the department prior to the issuance of a final plat or certificate of occupancy.
(h)
Where development is intended to occur in phases or increments, tree protection and replacement plan density calculations shall be based on a site area defined by each development phase or increment. Existing trees to be counted toward meeting the tree density requirements must be located within each phase or increment.
(i)
Stormwater management facilities shall be integrated landscape features, rather than single-purpose flood control or water quality treatment measures. Such facilities shall be planted with appropriate grasses, shrubs, and trees wherever naturally-occurring vegetation is unlikely to be attractive, dense, and healthy. In the event that stormwater facilities cannot be integrated landscape features, then all such facilities shall be masked from the street, open space, and abutting lots.

Sec. 328-26. - Exceptional trees.
(a)
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection, and are deemed exceptional trees. Specifications for exceptional trees may be found in the administrative standards promulgated pursuant to this article.
(b)
To obtain credit as an exceptional tree, the tree must be protected in its natural state, free from damage within the critical root zone. In order to encourage protection of exceptional trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credits shall be given for exceptional trees that are successfully protected from damage up to and including the date a certificate of occupancy is first issued or a final plat is first approved for the property.
(c)
Credit for any exceptional tree saved, with three feet of critical root zone protected per one inch of diameter at breast height, will be three times the assigned unit value shown in the administrative standards. Exceptional trees that need to be removed require written documentation indicating the reason for removal, to be submitted to the county forester prior to the removal. Exceptional trees removed with prior approval from the county forester must be replaced at the rate of half a unit for each unit awarded in the administrative standards. Exceptional trees must be replaced by species with similar characteristics. If an exceptional tree is damaged or removed without prior approval by the county forester, recompense or penalty shall be required or imposed as follows:
(1)
Any exceptional tree that is damaged or removed without the appropriate review and approval of the county forester must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of exceptional tree quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition.
(2)
In the event the county forester determines an exceptional tree is a hazard to property, power lines or people, the tree may be removed without recompense or penalty.
(3)
Any exceptional tree saved with one foot of critical root zone protected per one inch of diameter at breast height shall be given no credit towards the required density units and will require no recompense.
(d)
Trees that would otherwise be considered exceptional trees which are located in the right-of-way or within any required utility or drainage easements shall not be counted as exceptional trees in any calculation pursuant to this article.
(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008)
Sec. 328-27. - Maintenance period for all developments.
(a)
New landscape or tree plantings or existing protected trees used to meet the density requirements of this article for all developments shall be maintained for two years after the date of final inspection and shall require the posting of a maintenance bond by the applicant. Maintenance bonds shall be in an amount equal to 125 percent of the estimated cost of replacement of the newly planted or existing protected trees and landscape materials. Such maintenance shall keep landscape materials healthy, neat, and orderly in appearance, and free of litter and debris.
(b)
During the period of the two-year maintenance bond, the county forester shall have the right to conduct periodic inspections during normal business hours in order to confirm the health and viability of all required trees and vegetation.
(c)
If the county forester finds that vegetation or trees planted or protected to meet the required site density are dead or near death, the county forester shall so notify the applicant and the applicant shall replace those trees and landscape materials with plants of similar size within 30 days of notification. The failure of the applicant to timely plant any such replacement trees or landscaping shall result in forfeiture of the maintenance bond unless a performance bond is sought and granted pursuant to section 328-28.
(d)
Not sooner than 75 days nor later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond, the applicant shall petition the county forester to release the maintenance bond. Failure to petition the county forester shall result in forfeiture of the maintenance bond. Upon receipt of the petition, the county forester shall inspect the project to determine the health and viability of all required trees and landscaping. If the county forester finds that trees or landscaping need to be replaced, the county forester shall so notify the applicant and the applicant shall timely perform such additional work necessary to comply with the tree density requirements of this article. The failure of the applicant to timely replace the trees or landscaping specified by the county forester may result in forfeiture of the maintenance bond. Upon the county forester's final determination that all required trees and landscaping are healthy, the county forester shall so notify the applicant, and the maintenance bond shall be released.
(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008; Ord. No. 0-2016-03, § XVI, 4-26-2016)
Sec. 328-28. - Performance bonds.
New tree plantings and landscaping used to meet the density requirement of this article for commercial or residential developments may be postponed for up to six months provided that a performance bond is obtained. The basis for delay must be that either planting stock availability is low or weather conditions are not appropriate for planting new trees. All performance bonds shall be submitted to the department with the following:
(1)
The performance bond must be as provided in section 302-27.
(2)
Performance bonds shall be submitted to the department with appropriate documentation and justification of low plant stock availability and/or adverse weather conditions.
The developer will provide three estimates for material and labor to install required plantings from three different nurseries. The director will choose the appropriate bond amount from the three estimates provided. The bond will be assessed at 125 percent of the cost to ensure compliance.
(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008; Ord. No. 0-2016-03, § XVII, 4-26-2016)
Sec. 328-29. - Alternative compliance.
(a)
Where the minimum density requirements cannot be fully met because the site cannot support the required density of trees, the applicant shall make a contribution to the tree replacement fund. Contributions to the tree replacement fund shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any required permit. Such contributions shall be used for the sole purposes of planting and maintaining trees on public property.
(b)
The amount of the contribution shall be based upon the number, size and type of trees that cannot be planted at the site. The county forester shall estimate the cost to the county for the materials and labor associated with the trees. The amount of the contribution shall be 100 percent of the estimated costs for the materials and labor of planting such trees. The developer shall provide the county forester with three estimates from three different arborist or nurseries for the trees, materials and labor associated with planting.
(c)
The county forester may waive the provisions of this section if he determines that:
(1)
The unmet density is less than ten percent of the density requirement for the site; and
(2)
The developer otherwise substantially complies with the provisions of this article.
(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008)
Sec. 328-30. - Inspections.
(a)
The county forester may periodically inspect the project during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following the completion of work. Applicants shall cooperate with the department in making such inspections. The department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for the purpose of entering at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activities.
(b)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized county employee who requests entry for the purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(c)
Prior to the issuance of a permit for any land-disturbing activity, the county forester shall inspect all tree protection fencing for compliance with the tree protection and replacement plan. Failure to adhere to the landscaping and tree protection and replacement plan will subject the project to enforcement procedures found in this article.
(d)
Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, final plat, or other forms of county acceptance, the county forester shall inspect for compliance with the requirements of this article. Any disturbances in tree save areas or deficiencies in the required tree density factor will be cited at this time. Tree save area deficiencies must be corrected with new tree plantings prior to project release.
(e)
Existing trees that are not expected to survive will not be counted toward meeting density requirements. Conversely, any existing trees not shown to remain on plans but which have been saved (meeting all tree protection standards) through field adjustments may be counted toward density requirements, provided that all changes are recorded on the certificate of occupancy or the final plat.
(f)
Once a tree save area has been established through the department plan approval process, any unauthorized removal of trees in that area must be mitigated by planting new trees to a tree density factor of 60 units per acre. A revised tree protection and replacement plan must be submitted to and approved by the county forester.

Sec. 328-32. - Suspension, revocation, and modification of permits; stop-work orders; citations.
(a)
Suspension, revocation, and modification. Any land disturbance permit or building permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the director upon finding that the holder is in violation of any portion of this article.
(b)
Stop work orders. If it is determined that a person has engaged in land disturbing activities and has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be posted on the site. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this article within 24 hours after such notice of non-compliance has been issued shall result in immediate issuance of a stop work order. Where any emergency exists, as determined by the director, no written notice shall be required before a stop work order is issued.
(c)
Citations. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided for in chapter 110. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. The owner of any building, structure or site, or part thereof, where anything in violation of this article exists, and any architect, builder, contractor, operator or agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation shall be guilty of a separate offense. In addition to or in lieu of any fine or imprisonment, the department may require the replacement of trees by the person violating this article in order to meet the minimum requirements set out herein.
(d)
Future permits prohibited. In addition to all other penalties for violations of this article, no land disturbance permit or other permits shall be issued for any property or portion thereof until all outstanding violations of this article applicable to such property have been fully corrected and satisfied. Outstanding violations of this article shall continue to apply to such property regardless of a change in ownership. The director shall place appropriate holds on the county's land records to enforce this provision. This subsection shall not apply to permits issued by Rockdale County to stabilize or correct prior illegal or improper acts performed on such property.

(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008)
Sec. 328-35. - Appeals of decisions of administrative officials.
(a)
Appeal to director. Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the county forester or any other administrative official made pursuant to the provisions of this article may appeal that decision to the director. The aggrieved person shall file a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, within ten days after the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the director, after the notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the director or court of record on application, on notice to the official from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown. The director shall schedule a date, time, and location for the hearing of the appeal and shall give notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The applicant and affected administrative official may submit written evidence or arguments. The director shall issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days after the hearing. If no decision is made within this time frame, the appeal shall be considered granted. An appeal shall be sustained upon an expressed finding by the director that the administrative official's action was based upon an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that he or she acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the director may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided that all requirements imposed by the applicable laws other than these are met.
(b)
Appeal to board of adjustment. Any aggrieved person not satisfied by the decision of the director on appeal may appeal that determination to the board of adjustment in accordance with the procedures set forth in UDO section 238-8. Appeals from final decisions of the board of adjustment shall be as provided in UDO section 238-13.

Sec. 328-36. - Administrative standards.
The regulations set forth in the Rockdale County Landscaping and Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance Administrative Standards have been promulgated and adopted pursuant to this article. These administrative standards shall apply to any activity on real property, public or private, in unincorporated areas of the county to which the provisions of this article apply. The county forester shall administer these administrative standards.
(Ord. No. 0-2008-19, § 2, 11-25-2008; Ord. No. 0-2016-03, § XIX, 4-26-2016)
Sec. 328-37. - Timber harvesting.
(a)
Eligibility. If timber harvesting took place on the site within 36 months prior to submitting a preliminary plat or applying for a land disturbance permit or a zoning amendment, no such plat, permit or zoning amendment shall be approved.
(b)
Erosion control. As per O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 (6), as amended, Forestry Land Management Practices (including harvesting) are exempt from the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act (GESA). However, "when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in [O.C.G.A.] paragraphs (15) and (16) of subsection (b) of code section 12-7-6 , no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices."
(c)
Reforestation plan. Clear-cutting or seed tree harvesting a stand of trees for capital gain will only be permitted with a plan for how the area will be reforested. The selected type of harvest shall be listed on the Timber Harvesting Information Form. A reforestation plan, written by a professional forester, must be attached with the timber harvesting packet before a permit will be issued. The reforestation plan must show how the site will be prepared before re-establishing a fully stocked stand. The plan must show types of practices and dates for site preparation and replanting. A fully stocked stand may vary depending on species. For pine species there must be at least 400 trees per acre (TPA) growing freely throughout the harvested areas one year after planting or reseeding is complete. For general hardwood species replanting, a minimum of 150 TPA is required to be considered a fully stocked stand. The landowner must show documentation of reforesting the land within two years after harvesting is complete. If no progress has been completed, property owner will be subject to a three-year moratorium in which no further actions shall be approved on the property including application for a land disturbance permit, a zoning amendment, or the submittal of a preliminary plat.
(d)
Reforestation. As defined in the "National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution Forestry EPA 841-B-05-001, May 2005," silvicultural practices occur when "...forests are tended, harvested and replaced, usually defined by, but not limited to, the method of regeneration." Reforestation can be accomplished artificially or naturally. Natural regeneration is defined as allowing the crop trees to regenerate an area. The most common methods are coppice, seed-in-place, seed trees, and shelterwood. Artificial regeneration is defined as establishing a new forest by planting seedlings or by direct seeding.
(e)
Timber harvesting operations. Timber harvesting encompasses several operations for the purpose of this section. In addition to cutting trees, timber harvesting typically includes the layout of access roads, log decks and skid trails. It is in the best interest of everyone involved in forestry operations to properly plan and manage their operations by consistently following Georgia Best Management Practices to prevent any potential water quality problems. Below is a listing of the most common harvesting types used in this region:
(1)
Clear-cutting a stand of trees is the removal of all (zero to eight trees per acre) merchantable trees on a tract and will only be allowed if a reforestation plan has been developed and included with the timber harvesting packet. The reforestation plan shall demonstrate how the property will be reforested once harvesting is complete.
(2)
Seed-tree harvest can remove all trees, except eight to 15 uniformly spaced high quality seed producing dominant or co-dominant trees per acre to naturally re-seed the site after harvest. Seed-tree harvest can only be permitted if a reforestation plan has been developed and included with the timber harvesting packet. The management plan shall demonstrate how the property will be reforested once harvesting is complete. It is crucial to plan the timing of the harvest and to assure adequate seed fall. Prescribed burn and/or light harrow disking the ground after harvest will scarify the soil to ensure a germination of the seed. Seed trees should be selected to provide sufficient seed to achieve a fully stocked stand in the new cohort and ensure the seed trees continued survival and viability at the removal cut. Seed trees shall be selected based on the following key traits:
a.
Trees with a large crown will maximize seed production due to their greater vigor and large leaf area.
b.
Trees should be at reproductive maturity with past evidence of good seed production. Past evidence of good seed production is the best way to assure future seed production.
c.
Trees need to be wind firm. Increased taper is correlated to wind firmness, but may be a less desirable phenotype when managing for poles.
d.
Trees should have desirable phenotypes, since they are providing seed for the next rotation.
e.
Their form should be free of defects such as forking, sinuosity, or rami-corns (an excessively large and steeply angled branch that forms a large knot).
f.
No evidence of serious insect or disease susceptibility should be present.
(3)
Shelterwood harvest method must leave 21 to 60 dominant or co-dominant seed trees per acre. This harvest is a preferred even-aged natural regeneration system for non-prolific seed producing species and as a visually appealing regeneration system for certain hardwood and conifer species. A shelterwood harvest provides an abundance of seed and shelter for seedlings, as well as residual shade to control weeds. This type of harvest will not require a reforestation plan due to the sufficient stocking density left on site, however, the selected seed trees should be high quality (exceptional) specimens so as to provide high quality seeds.
(4)
Thinning operation means to leave a minimum residual stocking density that has the potential to restore to a closed canopy forest within ten years or have no more than 60 percent of the stand removed. Thinning harvest is intended to improve the overall health and quality of the remaining trees. If exceptional trees exist on-site, they should be given priority to be retained over other dominant or co-dominant trees. If the required density is met using non-exceptional trees and exceptional trees are found by the county forester to have been removed, then harvesting operation will not be considered as being for silvicultural purposes. This type of harvest will not require a reforestation plan upon permitting due to the sufficient stocking density left on site.
(f)
Access roads. Road construction shall be solely for silvicultural purposes. Access roads shall not exceed the typical maximum allowable width of 16 feet or should not be wider than necessary for the transport of silvicultural products or access for forest management activities. Roads wider than 16 feet will only be allowed upon county forester approval. In general, tree stumps are only removed to construct access roads and log decks. The presence of intensive mechanical site preparations such as sheering, root raking, windrowing debris or "stumping" of the site may be deemed as non-silvicultural activities.
(g)
GFC consulting. The Georgia Forestry Commission may be contacted by the county forester if technical assistance is required to determine if a land disturbing activity is a legitimate silvicultural activity exempt from Georgia Erosion and Sediment Control Act O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 , local erosion and sedimentation control ordinances, and permit requirements. The decision rendered by GFC shall be considered final.
(h)
Bonding. All timber harvesting operations of areas larger than five acres shall be required to obtain a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting the county against any damage caused by such operations in an amount specified by the department not exceeding $5,000.00. Alternatively at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber, a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4 , in the same amount of and in lieu of such bond may be submitted. For purposes of this paragraph, any such surety bond or letter of credit shall be valid only for the calendar year in which delivered.
(i)
Additional requirements. The following practices shall be required of all timber cutting incidental to development.
(1)
All access onto public roads shall have culverts and stone pads as prescribed in the Manual of Standards and Specifications for Georgia Erosion and Sediment Control Act.
(2)
Stream sides and access roads shall be seeded upon completion of harvesting operations as prescribed in the Manual of Standards and Specifications for Georgia Erosion and Sediment Control Act.
(j)
Additional requirements. The following practices shall be required of all timber harvesting for silviculture:
(1)
All such operations shall follow the latest version of Georgia's Best Management Practices for Forestry, available from the Georgia Forestry Commission.
(2)
All persons or firms harvesting standing timber for delivery as pulpwood, logs, poles, posts, or wood chips to any wood yard or processing plant shall provide notice of such harvesting operations by completing and submitting the harvesting package provided by the county prior to cutting any such timber.
(3)
Prior written notice shall be required of any person or firm harvesting such timber for each separate tract to be harvested thereby.
a.
Such notice shall be submitted on a form provided by the Georgia Forestry Commission and shall consist of:
1.
A map of the area which identifies the location of the tract to be harvested, the route trucks will be traveling to and from such tract for purposes of picking up and hauling loads of cut forest products, and the main and secondary (if any), points of ingress/egress to such tract from a public road(s). The map shall also include all areas harvested, all stream crossings and all loading decks;
2.
A statement as to whether the timber will be removed pursuant to a lump sum sale, per unit sale, or owner harvest for purposes of ad valorem taxation under state law;
3.
The name, address, and daytime telephone number of the timber seller if the harvest is pursuant to a lump sum or per unit sale or of the timber owner if the harvest is an owner harvest; and
4.
The name, business address, business telephone number, and nighttime or emergency telephone number of the person or firm harvesting such timber;
b.
Such notice may be submitted to the department in person, by facsimile, or by mail.
c.
Such notice shall be effective for stated harvesting operation on such tract upon receipt by the department and compliance with all of the requirements stated above. Notice will be active until such notice has completed the harvesting operation for such tract or one year has expired. Any subsequent change in the facts required to be provided for purposes of such notice shall be reported to the department within three business days after such change.
d.
Violation of the notice requirements in this subsection shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $500.00.
