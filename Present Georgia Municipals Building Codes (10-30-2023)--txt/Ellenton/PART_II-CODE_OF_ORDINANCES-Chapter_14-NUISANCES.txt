ARTICLE III. - ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES

Sec. 14-51. - Purpose.
It is important for a community to appear clean, well-kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties.
