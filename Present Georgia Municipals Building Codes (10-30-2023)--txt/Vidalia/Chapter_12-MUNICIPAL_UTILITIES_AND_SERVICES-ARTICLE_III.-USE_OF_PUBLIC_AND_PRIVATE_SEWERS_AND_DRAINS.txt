Requirements are minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this section shall be the minimum requirements.
(6)
Compliance with state and federal regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the city shall also meet the requirements of all other local, federal and state regulations in effect, including but not limited to, Department of Transportation regulations, State Fire Marshal regulations, Georgia's Uniform Construction Codes, Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act permits, and all other Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Environmental Protection Division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this section does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply.
(7)
Map interpretation. If there is any uncertainty as to whether a lot, portion of lot, or a proposed construction or location impacts an environmental resource regulated by this section because of interpretation of the applicable map, the decision of the City of Vidalia, or the Toombs County Health Department if it is delegated the responsibility for administering this section shall take precedent and be considered correct and final, but may be appealed as set forth in subsection (d)(8).
(8)
Map appeal. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the City of Vidalia or the Toombs County Health Department, as appropriate, regarding map interpretation may at their own expense request reconsideration. Such reconsideration shall include submission of scientific evidence for reversal of the alleged error in map interpretation, and such evidence must be documented by a state registered engineer, geologist, or soils scientist. To obtain a reversal of the decision of map interpretation, the evidence must be acceptable to Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division, and the City of Vidalia, or and the Toombs County Health Department if the Toombs County Health Department is delegated responsibility for administering this section. Any costs for submission of evidence to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division shall be borne by the person requesting reconsideration.
(9)
Coordination with zoning and other regulation. This section shall be coordinated with any zoning or other regulations adopted by the City of Vidalia, and if there is any conflict with those zoning or other regulations, the stricter provisions shall apply. If zoning is or has been adopted, the provisions of this section shall be considered an overlay, or additional requirement(s) to the requirements of underlying zoning regulations and district.
(10)
Fees. Any fees for applications, inspections, and the issuance of permits or certificates required or issued under the provisions of this section shall be paid by the person seeking such permit at the time of application in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates.
The amount of such fees, if any, shall be those established by the City of Vidalia from time to time.
(e)
Delegation of section administration. The City of Vidalia, because of the need for coordination, hereby charges the City of Vidalia zoning administrator with responsibility for administering this section and ensuring compliance with its provisions.
(f)
Wetlands protection regulations.
(1)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Vidalia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities.
(2)
Reference map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the City of Vidalia and to be regulated areas under this section will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Toombs County. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency.
(3)
Wetlands development permit requirements. No activity or use except those identified in subsection (f)(4) shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit issued under this section. Activities or uses permitted under Section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission/determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this section have been satisfied.
a.
If there is a determination in the administration of this section that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular subsection is necessary.
b.
If there is a determination in the administration of this section that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of Section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this section.
c.
If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this section will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at their own expense, obtains either a Section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required.
d.
No action in the administration of this section, or no local permit issued pursuant to this section, relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance.
(4)
Permitted uses not requiring a permit. The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the city to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein, and provided they have no long term impairment for wetland function.
a.
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission. (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, Section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.).
b.
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require a Section 404 Permit.
c.
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, bird watching, hiking, biking, boating, horseback riding, kayaking, and canoeing.
d.
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
e.
Normal agriculture activities, including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
(5)
Prohibited uses. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
a.
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
b.
Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.
(g)
Groundwater recharge areas protection regulations.
(1)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank affluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(2)
Reference map. The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the City of Vidalia to be regulated areas under this subsection is the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition)."
(3)
Groundwater recharge areas development permit requirements. All uses except those identified in subsection (g)(4) and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
a.
All new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of six hundred sixty (660) gallons, shall have secondary containment for one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of such tanks or one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of U.S. EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1 and following. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal and state requirements.
b.
All single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have one hundred fifty (150) percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DPH Manual) Tables MT-1 and MT-2 (included as part of this section in Appendix 1), as determined by the Toombs County Health Department. The minimums set forth in Tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the Public Health Manual. Said minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations or determination specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply.
c.
All lots shall have a minimum width of one hundred fifty (150) feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located.
d.
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other on-site sewage management system unless the Toombs County Health Department first approves the proposed on-site sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems and the provisions of this section.
e.
All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins.
f.
All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one (1) foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, or Georgia's Environmental Protection Division.
(4)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
a.
All new hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities.
b.
New facilities handling hazardous materials regulated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources as to require a permit.
c.
Permanent stormwater infiltration basins.
d.
All new sanitary or other landfills.
(h)
Major river corridor protection district regulations.
(1)
Findings of fact. Perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least four hundred (400) cubic feet per second are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb flood waters.
(2)
District delineation. Protected rivers as defined under the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to Section 12-2-8 of Article 1, Chapter 2, Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, includes any perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least four hundred (400) cubic feet per second. The Altamaha River and the Ohoopee River through Toombs County meet this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective one hundred (100) foot natural vegetative buffer, as defined in Georgia Rule 391-3-16, is hereby established along the entire length of this river(s) within the jurisdiction of Toombs County. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank, if any, within the city jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a one hundred (100) foot buffer of the river bank except for the following permitted uses.
(3)
Permitted uses. No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the one hundred (100) foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, as long as they do not impair the long term functions of the protected river or the protected river corridor. In addition, the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses.
a.
Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the Toombs County Health Department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two (2) acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the one hundred (100) foot buffer area.
b.
Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances provided the use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the Toombs County Health Department prior to the date of adoption of these local protection ordinances.
c.
Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental rules and regulations.
d.
Road and utility crossings, and utility locations if no other location is reasonable, providing the construction of these crossings and uses meet the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any other state or local requirements, if stricter, protect the integrity of the buffer area to the extent reasonably possible, and are located as far from the river bank as is reasonably possible.
e.
Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
f.
Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission or its successor, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
g.
Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of Section 12-2-8 (as amended) of Article 1, Chapter 2, Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.).
h.
Natural water quality treatment or purification.
i.
Wastewater treatment.
j.
Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation.
(4)
Prohibited uses. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them.
a.
Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes.
b.
Hazardous or solid waste landfills.
c.
Septic tank drainfields within the one hundred (100) foot buffer area under any circumstance.
d.
Septic tanks within the one hundred (100) foot buffer area, except as expressly provided for single-family dwellings which are permitted under and comply with subsection (h)(3)a.
(i)
Variances. When due to a particular hardship or extraordinary circumstance of the property involved which is not easily corrected, it is impractical for an owner or developer to comply with all of the requirements of this section, the City of Vidalia shall be authorized to vary such requirements (under its jurisdiction) only to such extent as to provide fairness to the owner or developer and as to not violate the intent and purposes of this section. Such variances shall only be granted in an official public meeting, and the reasons for granting them shall be entered into the minutes of the public meeting.
(j)
Violations and penalties. Violation of these provisions, prohibitions, and installation restrictions by any private individual, land owner, builder, remodeler, contractor, licensed electrician, licensed plumber, septic tank dealer or installer, mobile or manufactured home dealer or mover, or developer; or installation and delivery of any utility services by a public or private utility to any property which holds a septic tank system installed against these prohibitions and restrictions, shall be a violation of this section.
Any person violating, neglecting, or refusing to comply with any provision of this section shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to such penalties as are provided by law. The City of Vidalia may take other actions or remedies as available at law to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of provisions of this section.
(k)
Court of jurisdiction. The City of Vidalia or the Toombs County Board of Health, as appropriate, may bring complaints of violation of any provision of this section before either the Magistrate Court of Toombs County, the State Court of Toombs County, or the Vidalia Municipal Court, as so desired.
(l)
Legal status provisions. Should any subsection or provision of this section be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the section as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(m)
Conflicting ordinances. Whenever the provision of this section and those of some other ordinance or statute apply to the same subject matter, that ordinance requiring the highest, or more strict, standard shall govern. All other ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict with this section, to the extent of such conflict and not further, are hereby repealed to the extent necessary to give this section full force and effect.
(n)
Effective date. This section shall take effect and be in force on the date that is enacted and ordained by mayor and council of the City of Vidalia, Georgia.
APPENDIX 1
MINIMUM LOT SIZING FOR
ON-SITE SEWAGE MANAGEMENT
