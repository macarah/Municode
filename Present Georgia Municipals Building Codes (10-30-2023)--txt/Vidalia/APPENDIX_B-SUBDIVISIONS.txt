ARTICLE XIII. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS

Section 1301. - Required improvements.
(a)
Every subdivider shall be required to have installed by the appropriate city agency at subdividers expense, or with approval of the agency concerned to install the following street improvements and utilities:
(1)
Street grading, street basing, and street paving, in accordance with city specifications.
(2)
Sanitary sewer lines and manholes, surface drainage facilities, permanent reference monuments, street name signs, and road regulatory signs as recommended by the city engineer.
(3)
If a required sewer line cannot be connected to a trunkline sewer at the time of the development of the subdivision, septic tanks or a lift station shall be installed by and at the expense of the subdivider or lot purchaser for interim use, in conformity with the requirements of the city and/or county health department.
(4)
Water mains within the subdivision which shall comply with city specifications.
(5)
All subdivisions with underground electrical lines shall have placed appropriate utility poles for street lighting.
All required street improvements, utilities, and monuments shall be built to standards specified by the agency responsible for each. All utilities to be installed in the streets shall be placed and compacted prior to paving.
(b)
In order to encourage residential subdivision development inside the corporate limits, the city will provide incentives to developers for property meeting the following criteria:
(1)
The property must either be within the city limits, or pre-annexed into the city prior to any sketch plan or preliminary platting so that the property is developed totally under the city's subdivision ordinance, zoning ordinance, and other land use regulatory ordinances. Property outside the city must meet the requirements for annexation under Georgia statutes, so that the property is clearly within the city limits before any incentives can be contract for or received.
(2)
The property must be zoned R-1, R-1A, R-2 or R-3 by the city. The city may consider extending these incentives to property zoned PUD. The intent of this provision is to allow developers flexibility in developing cluster housing on smaller lots, with a corresponding increase in open space in common ownership maintained by a homeowners' association or similar entity.
(3)
The property must be reasonably close to existing water and sewer lines such that the city can economically extend the main lines to the subdivision. Such determination shall be made at the discretion of the city. Should more than one property owner make application for this incentive program in any fiscal year, the city reserves the right to decide which of the subdivisions is most economical for it to help develop, and to only develop those for which it has adequate funding in any given fiscal year. More than one subdivision per year may be developed if determined by the mayor and city council to be economically and financially feasible. If financial constraints dictate, no subdivision developments, with city participation, may be approved.
(4)
The subdivider must enter into a written agreement with the city, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, delineating the subdivider's and city's respective responsibilities for the various components of development.
(5)
The subdivider must develop the subdivision using underground electric, telephone, and CATV lines, curb and gutter, sidewalk on at least one side of each street, decorative street lights and poles, and covenants and restrictions requiring brick veneer or comparable construction and a minimum of a two-car enclosed garage. The intent is to develop subdivisions with high-end amenities compared to the existing market in the county.
(6)
The subdivision must be developed in reasonably-sized phases to as not to place a financial strain on either the developer of the city.
(c)
The city will provide the following incentives for the proposed subdivisions meeting the criteria in section (b) above:
(1)
The city will pay fifty (50) percent of the entire cost to install the water and sewer system in an approved subdivision following review and comment on the proposed plans by the city's engineers.
(2)
The city will pay fifty (50) percent of street development costs including curb, gutter and sidewalk if required.
(3)
The city will install all street signs and traffic signs within the subdivision.
(Ord. of 7-12-04)
Section 1302. - Bond in lieu of completion of improvements.
The planning commission may allow the subdivider to post a bond as defined below in lieu of completion of all the improvements as required by this article. The bond shall be made payable to the City of Vidalia and shall be of an amount sufficient to assure completion of all required improvements. The bond shall be approved and held until a specified reasonable length of time for completion has passed, after which the bond may be forfeited and the improvements installed by the city.
The bond identified above may be made in any of the following manners:
(1)
Cash bond; or
(2)
Insurance bond in the nature of a performance bond by an insurance carrier approved by the Vidalia Planning Commission; or
(3)
Bond in the form of a personal guaranty of the developer, properly secured by a first deed to secure debt on real estate located in Georgia, which is of a value at least double the amount of the estimated cost of the mandatory improvements as identified by these regulations, and said cost estimated shall be made in the sole discretion of the Vidalia Planning Commission. Said deed to secure debt being given to assure the city of full compliance with these regulations, including holding the city harmless as to any court cost and/or attorney fees incurred to enforce these regulations and/or enforcement of this performance bond.
(4)
In the event the subdivider posts bond under the provisions of section 1302, the bonding period shall be a five (5) year period. If, after five (5) years, the city has not provided trunkline sewerage to the subdivision or has not contracted to provide trunkline sewerage, or has not committed itself to provide trunkline sewerage within twelve (12) months of the expiration of the five (5) year period, then all obligation of the subdivider to continue the bond shall be terminated.
The subdivision developer and his performance bond shall continue to be accountable for the above regulations until said regulations are completed on said subdivision to the reasonable satisfaction of the Vidalia Planning Commission.
