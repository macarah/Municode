DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 12-101. - Purpose.
This article sets forth uniform requirements for users of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) for the City of Vidalia and enables the City of Vidalia to comply with all applicable federal and state laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with its operation;
(2)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;
(3)
To protect both POTW personnel, who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment, and the general public;
(4)
To improve opportunities for reuse and recycling of wastewater and sludge from the POTW;
(5)
To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance, and improvement of the POTW; and
(6)
To enable the City of Vidalia to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject.
This article authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
Sec. 12-102. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all users of the POTW.
Sec. 12-103. - Administration.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the control authority, as defined in this article, shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.

Pretreatment. The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in wastewater prior to (or in lieu of) introducing such pollutants into the POTW. This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical, or biological processes; by process changes; or by other means (except by diluting the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable pretreatment standard).
