Sec. 3.05.01. - Intent and purpose.
The streams and rivers of Butts County supply much of the water required by Butts County citizens for drinking and other municipal and industrial uses. The quality of the groundwater that is used for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes in Butts County is connected with the quality of the surface water in the streams and rivers of Butts County. Furthermore, the people of Butts County use the surface waters for fishing, canoeing, and other recreational and economic purposes. The Butts County board of commissioners finds that the protection of the streams and rivers of Butts County is vital to the health, safety and economic welfare of its citizens.
It is therefore the intent of this ordinance to establish a new riparian buffer zone of restricted development and limited land use adjacent to all perennial streams and rivers in Butts County. The purposes of the riparian buffer zone are: to protect public and private water supplies, to trap sediment and other pollutants in surface runoff, to promote bank stabilization, to protect riparian wetlands, to minimize the impact of floods, to prevent decreases in base flow, to protect wildlife habitat, and to generally maintain water quality.
The standards and regulations set forth in this ordinance are created under the authority of Butts County's home rule and zoning powers defined in the Georgia Constitution (Article DC, Section 2). In the event of a conflict between or among any provisions of this ordinance, or any other ordinances of Butts County, the requirement that is most restrictive and protective of water quality shall apply.
