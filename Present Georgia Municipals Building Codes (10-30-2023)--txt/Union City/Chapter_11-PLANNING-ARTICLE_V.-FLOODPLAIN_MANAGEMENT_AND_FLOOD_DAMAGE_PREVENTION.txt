Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(c)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(d)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(e)
Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural, protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and
(f)
Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

Regulatory flood means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood. The regulatory flood is defined as the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year assuming the drainage basin is fully developed as shown on the current land use plan. Only structural stormwater control facilities that can be shown will remain (i.e. owned by the City of Union City) and are large enough to be included in the hydrograph routings shall be considered when determining the flood peak.
Regulatory flood elevation means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood elevation. The regulatory flood elevation is defined as the highest water surface anticipated at any given point during the regulatory flood.
Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the land development project is located.
Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article that permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

(Ord. No. 2004-10, § 1, 5-18-04)
Sec. 11-86. - Standards for land development.
(a)
Definition of floodplain boundaries.
(1)
Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available.
(2)
For special flood hazards areas and floodprone areas, the regulatory flood elevations shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by the city.
(3)
The boundaries or limits of the floodplain shall be within 0.5 feet vertical accuracy on the site plan containing existing topographic information.
(b)
Definition of floodway boundaries.
(1)
The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study.
(2)
Following a predesign conference with the city the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the (development or stormwater) site plan containing existing topographic information.
(c)
General standards.
(1)
No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth shall be allowed within the regulatory floodplain that could result in any of the following:
a.
Raising the regulatory flood elevation beyond the boundaries of the ownership of the property being developed unless contained in a drainage easement obtained by the developer;
b.
Reducing the regulatory flood storage capacity. All compensation for storage capacity shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed, or within a permanent, recorded flood control easement, and shall be within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include: lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain; or, lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain; or raising of the regulatory flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than 1.0 percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater analysis will be required to determine the volume of flood storage created by raising the regulatory flood elevation;
c.
Changing the flow characteristics of the waters of the regulatory flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property. Verification shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis; or
d.
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. In all cases effective transitions must be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased.
(2)
All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(3)
Any significant changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Union City using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six (6) months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as built surveys which demonstrate general conformance to the approved designs as submitted in the CLOMR application. A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be defined as any change to the FIRM easily observed when plotted at a scale of 1" = 1,000'. The changes or revisions may be due to, but are not limited to, more current and/or superior topographic information or compensatory cut and fill grading done as a part of the development.
(d)
Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb the regulatory floodplain. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Union City prior to the approval of any permit that would authorize the disturbance of land located within the floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the City of Union City. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and regulatory flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one (1) every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that regulatory floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
If changes to the regulatory flood elevation are proposed, profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed regulatory flood elevations must be provided; and
(5)
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments.
(e)
Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except when required for the construction of bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the preproject base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the regulatory or base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(2)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the business license, tax, and permit department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued by FEMA.
(f)
Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Union City may direct the property owner at no cost to the City of Union City to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with Union City. This shall be done at property owner's expense.

New construction. New construction of principal buildings, including manufactured homes shall not be allowed within the limits of the floodplain.
b.
Substantial improvements. Substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be authorized by the city administrator to be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation, whichever is highest, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the city administrator.
(3)
Accessory structures and facilities. Accessory structures and facilities (i.e., barns, sheds, gazebos, detached garages, parking lots, recreational facilities and other similar structures and facilities) which are permitted to be located within the limits of the floodplain shall be designed and constructed to pass all floodwater in a manner consistent with this article.
(4)
Standards for recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
a.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
b.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "Residential Buildings—Substantial Improvements", including the anchoring and elevation requirements above.
(5)
Building standards for structures and buildings authorized adjacent to the floodplain.
a.
Residential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal residential building or manufactured home, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least three (3) feet above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest.
b.
Nonresidential buildings. For new construction or substantial improvement of any principal non-residential building, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement and access to the building, shall be at least one (1) foot above the level of the highest base flood (100-year) elevation adjacent to the building or at least as high as the regulatory flood elevation whichever is highest.
(6)
Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones) or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the city administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any available scientific or historic base flood elevation or regulatory flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions and standards of this section. If sufficient data are not available from these sources, then the city administrator may accept a hydrologic assessment performed by a registered professional engineer to determine the regulatory flood and floodway elevations.
(7)
Building standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO-zones). Areas of special flood hazard may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. In these areas the following provisions apply:
a.
All substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards for "Elevated Buildings." The applicant's or owner's engineer shall certify to the City Administrator that the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file;
b.
Substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice; and
c.
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(8)
Standards for subdivisions.
a.
All subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and provide base flood and regulatory flood elevation data;
b.
All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood or regulatory flood elevation, the lowest flood and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the city administrator;
c.
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
d.
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; and
e.
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(9)
Standards for utilities.
a.
All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate:
1.
Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
2.
Discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
b.
On-site waste disposal systems shall be located outside the floodplain to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding.

Sec. 11-88. - Variance procedures.
(a)
The mayor and council as established for the City of Union City shall hear and decided requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article.
(b)
The mayor and council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the mayor and council, any taxpayer or any officer, department, board or bureau of Union City may within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the mayor and council, but not thereafter, seek review of such decision by a court as provided by law.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is a:
a.
Finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The city administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the mayor and council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
