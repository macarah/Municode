(5)
Pressurized flushing device means a device that contains a valve that:
a.
Is attached to a pressurized water supply pipe that is of sufficient size to deliver water at the necessary rate of flow to ensure flushing when the valve is open; and
b.
Opens on actuation to allow water to flow into the fixture at a rate and in a quantity necessary for the operation of the fixture and gradually closes to avoid water hammer.
(6)
Toilet means a water closet.
(7)
Water closet means a fixture with a water-containing receptor that receives liquid and solid body waste and on actuation conveys the waste through an exposed integral trap into a drainage system and which is also referred to as a toilet.

WaterSense™ means a voluntary program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency designed to identify and promote water efficient products and practices.
(c)
The following standards related to high-efficiency plumbing fixtures are minimum standards to be utilized in construction. These standards include without limitation, the following:
(1)
A water closet or toilet that:
a.
Is a dual flush water closet that meets the following standards:
1.
The average flush volume of two (2) reduced flushes and one (1) full flush may not exceed 1.28 gallons;
2.
The toilet meets the performance, testing, and labeling requirements prescribed by the following standards, as applicable:
(i)
American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard A112.19.2-2008; and
(ii)
American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard A112.19.14-2006 "Six-Liter Water Closets Equipped with a Dual Flushing Device"; and
3.
Is listed to the WaterSense™ Tank-Type High Efficiency Toilet Specifications; or
b.
Is a single flush water closet, including gravity, pressure assisted, and electro-hydraulic tank types, that meets the following standards:
1.
The average flush volume may not exceed 1.28 gallons;
2.

3.
The toilet must be listed to the WaterSense™ Tank-Type High Efficiency Toilet Specification;
(2)
A shower head that allows a flow of no more than an average of 2.5 gallons of water per minute at sixty (60) pounds per square inch of pressure;
(3)
A urinal and associated flush valve that:
a.
Uses no more than 0.5 gallons of water per flush;
b.
Meets the performance, testing, and labeling requirements prescribed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard A112.19.2/CSA B45.1;
c.

Where nonwater urinals are installed they shall have a water distribution line roughed-in to the urinal location at a minimum height of fifty-six (56) inches (1,422 mm) to allow for the installation of an approved backflow prevention device in the event of a retrofit. Such water distribution lines shall be installed with shut-off valves located as close as possible to the distributing main to prevent the creation of dead ends. Where nonwater urinals are installed, a minimum of one (1) water supplied fixture rated at a minimum of one (1) water supply fixture unit shall be installed upstream on the same drain line to facilitate drain line flow and rinsing;
(4)
A lavatory faucet or lavatory replacement aerator that allows a flow of no more than 1.5 gallons of water per minute at a pressure of sixty (60) pounds per square inch in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard A112.18.1/CSA B.125.1 and listed to the WaterSense™ High-Efficiency Lavatory Faucet Specification; and
(5)
A kitchen faucet or kitchen replacement aerator that allows a flow of no more than 2.0 gallons of water per minute.
