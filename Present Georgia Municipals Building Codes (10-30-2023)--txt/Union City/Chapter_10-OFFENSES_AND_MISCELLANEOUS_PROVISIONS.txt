Sec. 10-25. - Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire.
(a)
Legislative findings and intent.
(1)
The mayor and council finds that sex acts for hire are inherently exploitative, endanger the health, safety and welfare of the participants and citizens in general, affect property values, and are an affront to the dignity of our citizens. These exploitative acts adversely affect a property or area in which they occur and lead to the avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens, increased opportunity for unlawful criminal activities, and further decay of neighborhoods.
(2)
The City has a strong interest: (i) in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods; (ii) in protecting the health of its citizens; (iii) in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts; and (iv) in preserving peace and order in public places to enable them to be used for their intended purpose.
(3)
The mayor and council find that loitering for the purpose of procuring others to engage in sex acts for hire usually includes a power imbalance between those seeking to purchase the sexual services and those being exploited to perform the sex acts, with the persons procuring the sexual services tending to be more economically and socially advantaged than the people who would provide the sex acts. A person seeking to purchase the sexual services bears a greater responsibility for the transaction than does the person being prostituted. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged by criminal justice experts that holding purchasers, or "johns," principally accountable for these sex acts for hire is the most effective method available to reduce the incidence of prostitution in an area.
(4)
This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising the right to assemble or engage in any constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in sex acts for hire.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 10-64, in or near any thoroughfare or place open to the public in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting, pandering or procuring another to commit a sexual act for hire.
(c)
A law enforcement officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with an articulable suspicion to believe a sexual act for hire has occurred or is occurring may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section.
(d)
A law enforcement officer may detain an individual under this section if an element from subsection (1) and an element from subsection (2) or both elements from subsection (3) below are satisfied:
(1)
The person engages in one (1) or more of the following behaviors:
a.
Repeatedly circling the block in a motor vehicle;
b.
Stopping a motor vehicle in a public roadway to beckon to, stop, or engage with persons on the side of the road;
c.
Repeatedly stopping or attempting to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waiving of arms or any bodily gesture; or
d.
Driving around or sitting in a parked car in a parking lot or vacant lot.
(2)
One (1) of the following factors applies:

b.
The person is loitering in an area that is known to be a common location for prostitution-related activity;
c.

f.

(3)
a.
The person enters or is present in a hotel room that is not registered to said person; and
b.
The person is on the premises of a hotel that is associated with an advertisement for prostitution-related activity.
(e)

The permittee will be responsible for deactivating the alarm system within a reasonable time following notification by the Union City Department of Public Safety (police or fire).
