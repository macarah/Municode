Drawings means documents which show largely through graphical presentation the characteristics and scope of the work to be performed and which have been prepared or approved by the engineer.
Engineer means the person, firm or corporation named as the engineering representative of the owner/developer.
Owner/developer means a public or quasi-public body or authority, corporation, association, partnership, or individual for whom the work is to be performed.
Project means the undertaking to be performed by the contractor.
Standards means City of Union City standards for the improvement, extension or upgrading the city's public water system.
Subcontractor means an individual, firm or corporation having a direct contract with the contractor or with any other subcontractor for the performance of a part of the work at the site.
Work means all labor necessary to produce the construction required by the project, and all materials and equipment incorporated or to be incorporated.
Sec. 15-44. - Referenced standards.
All material and workmanship specified by number, symbol, or title of referenced standard shall comply with the latest edition or revisions thereof.
Sec. 15-45. - Inspections.
The city engineer and his representatives will at all times have access to the work. The owner/developer will provide proper facilities for such access and observation of the work and also for any inspection, or testing thereof. Inspections may also be made at the factory or fabrication plant of the source of material or equipment supply.
Sec. 15-46. - Final acceptance.
(a)
Upon completion of all work items in the project, the owner/developer shall notify the city in writing, whereupon the city engineer shall make a formal inspection of the project. Should the entire work appear to be complete and in conformance with the standards, the city engineer will issue a certificate that the work has been completed and is ready for acceptance by the city. The city engineer's certificate of completion will be presented for consideration of the city council at the first regular council meeting after actual project completion. If the work does not entirely meet requirements of the standards at the time of inspection, the city engineer will advise the city of items which require completion or correction. After completing or correcting deficiencies noted by the city engineer together with any additional deficiencies which appear, the owner/developer shall again notify the city in writing. The inspection and completion or correction process shall then be repeated until the entire project at the time of inspection shall appear to be in conformance with the standards. If any work is damaged or discovered to be deficient after an initial inspection but prior to final acceptance, such work shall have been completed or corrected at the time of final acceptance, but this requirement shall not extend to repair of work damaged by the city.
(b)
Upon satisfactory completion of any discrepancies noted during this inspection, the owner/developer will begin the twelve-month maintenance period required for the project.
(c)
At the end of twelve (12) months, the city will reinspect the entire project. When all discrepancies have been corrected by the owner/developer, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance of the project.

Testing. Furnish and use appropriate test equipment and methods. Include gage, meter, pump and connections. Bleed all air from system prior to testing, providing any necessary corporation stops and piping installations. Pressure test all elements of the piping system. Where piping is buried or otherwise concealed, maintain the pressure test for not less than six (6) hours. Visible piping may be tested for a lesser time period, if approved by the city. Conduct pressure testing at two hundred (200) psig unless a lower pressure is recommended by a manufacturer of an element of the system. When a manufacturer does recommend a lower test pressure, furnish the engineer with a detailed written explanation before commencing test work. In no event may the lower test pressure be less than one hundred ten (110) percent of the nominal working pressure of the pipe comprising the system. Measure pressure for testing referred to the elevational datum of the lowest pipe of the line section being tested. Where possible, use methods and perform construction work in such sequence as necessary to accomplish pressure testing as work progresses. Do not pressure test more than a one (1) mile length of pipe at one (1) time. Provide temporary piping and accessories if required to isolate test sections. Makeup water, required to maintain test pressure in gallons per hour per one thousand (1,000) feet of pipe under test, over the test period may not exceed the quantities shown in the following table:
EXPAND
Pipe Size
Inches Quantity
Gallons per Hour
2 0.16
3 0.24
4 0.32
6 0.47
8 0.63
10 0.79
12 0.95
14 1.10
  Repair all breaks, detectable leaks or other defects and retest as many times as necessary to obtain passing test.
(m)
Disinfecting. Chlorinate all potable waterlines on completion of construction, after flushing and prior to placing in service. Use precaution to prevent backflow to supply system. Fill lines with potable water containing sufficient chlorine to show a twenty-five (25) ppm minimum residual at the end of the twenty-four-hour retention period, (fifty-ppm minimum applied). Locate application point at beginning of pipeline extension and apply chlorine by means of a solution feed device. Operate all valves and hydrants while filling the pipeline with chlorinating agent. Draw off at taps and hydrants along the line until an ortho-tolidine test shows a strong indication of residual chlorine. Retain chlorinated water in the system for a period of twenty-four (24) hours. Test for twenty-five-ppm residual. If residual is twenty-five (25) ppm or greater flush the system with potable water, otherwise repeat entire procedure until satisfactory results are obtained. Demonstrate lines to be free of contamination by drawing samples therefrom on two (2) successive days in the presence of the engineer. Deliver samples to the city for forwarding to a qualified laboratory for examination. On receipt of satisfactory test report from the foregoing laboratory, and with the approval of the city, the lines so tested are to be considered free of contamination and placed in service. In the event contamination persists, resterilize as necessary until receipt of satisfactory test report.
(n)
Final acceptance by the city. The owner/developer shall before final acceptance present to the city the following:
(1)
Length of waterline installed by line size;
(2)
Construction record drawings.

(2)
Policy.
a.
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the city unless the water supply is protected as required by federal and state laws and regulations and this section. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the city if a backflow-prevention assembly required by this section is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow-prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
b.
The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the city administrator shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
c.
An approved backflow-prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist:
1.
In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the city administrator, the city water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard.
2.
In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the city water system, the city system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system that have been subject to deterioration in quality.
3.
In the case of premises having (1) internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled, or (2) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it impractical or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the city water system shall be protected against backflow from the premise by installing an approved backflow-prevention assembly in the service line.
d.
The type of protective assembly required under subsections C.2.c.(1), C.2.c.(2), and C.2.c.(3) shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows:
1.
In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection C.2.c.(1) of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly.
2.
In case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the city water system, the city water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.
3.
In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health that is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the city water system, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants.
4.
In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross connections, either actual or potential, the city water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly at the service connection.
5.
In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the city water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly on each service to the premises.
6.
In the case of any premises where, in the opinion of the city administrator, an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of extremely toxic substances, the city administrator may require an air-gap at the service connection to protect the city water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the city administrator and is dependent on the degree of hazard.
e.
Any backflow-prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the city engineer. The term approved backflow-prevention assembly shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) titled:
AWWA C510, latest edition—Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and
AWWA C511, latest edition—Standard for Reduced-Pressure Principle Backflow-Prevention Assembly, and have met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications of the Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (FCCHR) of the University of Southern California established by
"Specification of Backflow-Prevention Assemblies"—Sec. 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross-Connection Control.
Said AWWA and FCCHR standards and specifications have been adopted by the city engineer. Final approval shall be evidenced by a "Certificate of Approval" issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA standards and FCCHR specifications.
Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by a qualified laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's current list of approved backflow-prevention assemblies may be used without further testing or qualification.
f.
It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the city administrator deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, public works department personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the city administrator. It shall be the duty of the city administrator to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the city administrator in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the city administrator may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the city administrator.
g.
All presently installed backflow-prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection D.2.f, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the city administrator is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the city administrator finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.
