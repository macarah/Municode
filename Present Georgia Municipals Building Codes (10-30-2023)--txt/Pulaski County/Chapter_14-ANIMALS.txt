ARTICLE III. - MULTIPLE DEAD ANIMAL DISPOSAL

Sec. 14-61. - Title.
This article shall be known and cited as the Pulaski County Multiple Dead Animal Disposal Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 2010-006, § 1, 12-20-2010)
Sec. 14-62. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to ensure the protection of the public health, safety and general welfare through the establishment of regulations relating to the disposal of multiple animal carcasses. To avoid the creation of a nuisance proper management of dead animals is essential since it can cause odor and aesthetic problems; surface and groundwater pollution; disease; and insect, rodent and predator problems.
(Ord. No. 2010-006, § 2, 12-20-2010)
Sec. 14-63. - Disposal requirements.
For the purposes of this article multiple shall apply to ten or more animals that require disposal within any 24-hour period, except for animals killed during normal use of motor vehicles on roadways. Disposal of animal carcasses must be completed within 12 hours after death or discovery of the carcass, as set forth in O.C.G.A. Title 4, Chapter 5, known as the "Dead Animal Disposal Act."
(Ord. No. 2010-006, § 3, 12-20-2010)
Sec. 14-64. - Permitted disposal methods.
Incineration is the preferred method of disposal within the boundaries of Pulaski County. Based upon research conducted by the University of Georgia's Cooperative Extension and other leading national agricultural research centers, it has been determined that incineration is one of the most biologically safe methods for mortality disposal. During incineration, the entire carcass is reduced to ashes, which will not attract pests and can easily be dispersed.
As incinerators operated within Pulaski County are required to be permitted and meet all requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, there will be no fees for disposal utilizing an EPD approved incinerator.
For all other methods of animal disposal including but not limited to open pits and gasification, an inspection fee will be imposed. The fee amount is based on the time schedule Pulaski County deems necessary to ensure proper disposal according to the following chart:
EXPAND
Open pit burial $100.00 monthly
Approved composting $100.00 quarterly
Approved gasification $100.00 yearly
Permitted incineration No fee
All other methods $100.00 monthly
  After a period of six months from the adoption of this article, whenever an unacceptable disposal method is found to exist within the jurisdiction of Pulaski County, the code enforcement officer shall give written notice to the owner or occupant of the property upon which such a nuisance exists or upon the person causing or maintaining the nuisance, to abate the nuisance within a period of 90 days.
(Ord. No. 2010-006, § 4, 12-20-2010)
Sec. 14-65. - Notice to abate.
Failure to abate the nuisance within the period of 90 days upon receiving official written notice to do so will result in a fine of $1,000.00 per day until the nuisance is eliminated in addition the required inspection fees.
Failure to pay required fees within the period of 30 days upon receiving official written notice to do so will result in a fine of $1,000.00 per day until all fees are paid.
Violations of this article and enforcement of penalties provided hereinabove shall be adjudicated in the Magistrate Court of Pulaski County, Georgia.
(Ord. No. 2010-006, § 5, 12-20-2010)
