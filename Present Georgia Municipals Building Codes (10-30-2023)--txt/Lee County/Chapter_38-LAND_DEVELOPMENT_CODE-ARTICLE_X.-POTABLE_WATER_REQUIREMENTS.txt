Water samples must be taken from suitable taps.
(8)
Chlorinating valves and hydrants. In the process of chlorinating newly laid water pipe, all valves or other appurtenances shall be operated while the pipe is filled with the chlorinating agent.
(9)
Final flushing and test. On dead-end lines, temporary flushing outlets shall be provided and the dead-end thoroughly flushed. Temporary outlets shall be removed and end of line plugged after flushing is complete.
(10)
Repetition of procedure. Should the initial treatment prove ineffective, the chlorinating procedure shall be repeated until confirmed tests show that water sampled from the newly laid pipe conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
(11)
Calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime in water. On approval of the manager of development services, a mixture of either calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime of known chlorine content my be substituted as an alternative for liquid chlorine.
(12)
Proportions of calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime and water mixture. A five percent solution shall be prepared consisting of five percent of either powder to 95 percent water by weight.
(13)
Application. This calcium hypochlorite or chlorinated lime and water mixture, first made into a paste and them thinned to a slurry, shall be injected or pumped into newly laid pipe under conditions heretofore specified for liquid chlorine applications after preliminary flushing.
(14)
Approval. Provisions for final flushing, testing and approval under this alternative shall be the same as those described previously.
(15)
Procedure when cutting into existing pipelines. Cuts made in existing pipelines for the insertion of valves, fittings, repairs, or for any other purpose shall be chlorinated by shaking a predetermined quantity of the powder into the pipe on each side of the cut-in. After slowly filling the section and reversing the flow, the chlorinated water shall be retained for at least four hours, then flushed until no order of chlorine can be detected in the flushing water, or until a check has been made for residual chlorine as provided for herein. If the contractor has any knowledge of foreign material entering the water line, or if the unfinished connection has been left unattended, or if the manager of development services requests, service shall not be restored until the absence of bacteria in the water has been demonstrated.
(16)
Resumption of service. After satisfactory chlorinating by any of these alternative procedures, the consumer may be served from the newly laid pipeline or the service may be resumed on existing pipelines only after approval of the public health authority having jurisdiction and the county.
(g)
Water quality tests of water mains.
(1)
Following chlorinating, all treated water shall be thoroughly flushed from the newly laid pipe line at its extremities until the replacement water is throughout its length.
(2)
After thoroughly flushing the new pipe, the water is required to be, upon testing, both chemically and bacteriologically proven equal to the water quality served the public and approved by the public health authority having jurisdiction and the manager of development services.
(3)
Should the initial treatment as specified above prove ineffective, the water line purification procedure shall be repeated until confirmed tests show that water sampled from the newly laid pipe conforms to the requirements.
(4)
Resumption of service. After satisfactory waterline purification by any of the procedures above, the consumer may be served from the newly laid pipeline or the service may be resumed on existing pipelines only after the approval of the public health authority having jurisdiction and the manager of development services.

(5)
Permissible leakage. Suitable means will be provided by the contractor for determining the quantity of water lost by leakage under normal operating pressure. No pipe installation will be accepted if the leakage (evaluated on a pressure basis of 150 psi) is greater than that determined by the following formula:
L = SD(P).5/133,200
EXPAND
Where: L is the allowable leakage in gallons per hour;
S is the length of pipe tested, in feet;
D is the nominal diameter of the pipe, in inches; and
P is the average test pressure during the leakage test, in pounds per square inch gauge.
  (6)
Variation from permissible leakage. Should any sections of pipe show leakage greater than the specified limit, the contractor shall locate and repair the defective part of the section until the leakage is within the specified allowance. When existing valves are used to isolate a section of line being tested, the contractor shall provide temporary caps or plugs to isolate the line being tested if the existing valve will not hold the required test pressure without leaking.
(7)
Leakage defined. Leakage is the quantity of water to be supplied into the newly laid pipe, or any valved section [on] it, necessary to maintain the specified leakage test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water and the air expelled.
(8)
Time for making test. Pipe may be subjected to hydrostatic pressure, inspected and tested for leaking at any convenient time after partial completion of backfill.

The pipe shall be coated on the outside only with a coal tar primer coat followed by a single application of hot coal tar enamel 3/32 inch thick plus a 1/32 inch, bonded 15 lb. asbestos felt wrap or approved equal. At the option of the contractor, uncoated pipe may be used subject to the approval of Lee county, the Georgia Department of Transportation or the railway company provided the wall thickness is at least .063 inch greater than coated pipe.
(h)
Corporation and curb stops.
(1)
Corporation stops shall be Mueller No. H-9971, H-15009 or equals from Hays, McDonald, Ford or Jones.
(2)
Curb stops shall be Mueller No. H-15175, H-15211, or H-15171 or equals from Hays, McDonald, Ford or Jones.
(i)
Miscellaneous materials.
(1)
The threaded rods and clamps for anchorage shall be mild steel conforming to ASTM A-36. The rods and clamps shall be brushed clean of all rust and foreign matter and completely coated with "no-oxide" or an approved equal before backfilling.
(2)
Anchoring couplings shall meet the requirements set forth for cast iron or ductile iron fittings.
(3)
Locked mechanical joint retainer glands shall be ductile iron retainer glands equipped with the hardened cupped and set screws. Assembly shall be designed for a minimum pressure or 250 psi. Retainer gland screws shall be tightened as recommended by the manufacturer.
(4)
Tapped valves and sleeves shall meet the requirements set forth for gate valves. Tapping sleeves shall be all stainless steel or ductile iron construction.
(5)
The minimum compressive strength required for formed concrete at 28 days is 3,000 lbs. Psi.
(6)
All stone for rip-rap shall consist of rough, unhewn quarry stone weights not less than 165 pounds per cubic foot as nearly rectangular in section as possible. The stone shall be resistant to the action of air, temperature changes and water. It shall be sound and dense and suitable in all other respects for the purpose intended.
a.
A six-inch thick blanket of slag or gravel shall be placed as a bed for rip-rap. Slag or gravel shall be as hereafter specified.
b.
Rip-rap shall be placed in such a manner as to insure that the larger pieces are distributed uniformly and that the smaller pieces will fill the spaces between the larger pieces. After placing the rip-rap it shall present a reasonably smooth surface to the thickness.
c.
