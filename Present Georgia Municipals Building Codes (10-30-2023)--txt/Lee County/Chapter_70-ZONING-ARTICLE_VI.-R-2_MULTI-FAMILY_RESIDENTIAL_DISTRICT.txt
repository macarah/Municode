ARTICLE VI. - R-2 MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 70-196. - Statement of purpose.
The R-2, multi-family residential district is designed to permit residential use of land with various types of multiple dwellings and related uses. For good accessibility, this district shall be located adjacent to arterial and/or collector roads as described in chapter 38 of this Code. Public water and sewer shall be required. Any developments in this district shall be designed to complement adjacent, existing or planned, single-family developments. Various types and sizes of residential accommodations, for ownership or rental, would thereby be provided to meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the community without overtaxing existing community facilities, utilities or services.
It is also the intention of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one building on a given site. The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record would in certain cases of large scale development have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments as special and particular land uses can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties. This type of development will permit a creative approach to residential development. A planned unit development will provide for an efficient use of land potentially resulting in more economical networks of streets and utilities thereby lowering housing and other land development costs as well as enhancing the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of natural features and the provision of recreation areas and open space.
In creating this zoning district the county intends to encourage home ownership; increase the variety of dwelling types in the housing market; and allow for innovative uses of real property which may not be suitable for development for other kinds of residential uses.
