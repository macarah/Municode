ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN CONSIDERATION IN LAND DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AND LAYOUT
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 38-151. - General design standards.
(a)
The design of every development shall be compatible with the existing topography, drainage pattern and other natural features on the site.
(b)
The design of every development shall conserve, wherever possible, mature trees, wooded areas, water courses, scenic views, ponds, floodplain areas, historic landmarks and other significant and distinct features of the property.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-151)
Sec. 38-152. - Classification of streets.
(a)
There are three broad classification of streets within the county as listed below:
(1)
Residential streets.
a.
Residential streets represent the lowest traffic volume category. Their primary function is to serve abutting land use and provide access to residential uses. All residential streets are intended to accommodate relatively low traffic volumes at slow speeds in order to minimize the basic incompatibility of vehicles and the pedestrians and children that characterize residential neighborhoods. Depending upon the type and density of development served by these streets, they are more accurately subcategorized as follows.
1.
A local street serves a maximum of 50 dwelling units or has average daily trips (ADT) of fewer than 500 vehicles. A local street may be culs-de-sac, loops or small cross streets. They do not function as a minor or major street, collector or arterial road.
2.
A minor street collects traffic from local streets, as well as giving access to individual dwelling units. A minor street serves 51 to 115 dwelling units or has average daily trips fewer than 1,150 vehicles.
3.
A major street provides access to minor and local streets and serves from 116 to 160 dwelling units or has average daily trips of 1,600 vehicles.
b.
The following shall be applied to determine the number of dwelling units served by a street. This number shall then be used to determine the residential street subtype and therefor the standards that shall be applied.
1.
A street segment is the length of a street between intersections or between points that define a change in street configuration.
2.
The number of dwelling units served by a street segment includes all units having a frontage on that street segment and all units that have frontage on other segments of that street or other streets that contribute to the traffic volume of that segment.
3.
When more than one route of access is available to a dwelling unit, that unit shall be counted as served by the street segments most likely to provide the access point for that unit as determined by the manager of development services.
(2)
Collector streets intercept traffic from intersecting residential streets and deliver this traffic to arterial roads. A secondary function is service to abutting land use. Collector streets serve as barriers between neighborhoods and are designed for higher speeds and traffic volumes than residential streets. Collector streets are classified into two types as follows:
a.
A minor collector may be residential, commercial, or industrial in character. Average daily traffic is between 1,600 and 3,200 vehicles and includes any street serving more than 160 dwelling units.
b.
A major collector services major regional facilities and may carry non-local traffic. Average daily trips are between 3,200 and 7,000 vehicles and no parking on the street is permitted.
(3)
Arterial streets are intended to provide for high-speed travel between or within communities or to and from collectors and expressways. Access is controlled so that only regionally significant land uses may take direct access to these roads. Average daily trips are usually over 7,000 vehicles.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-152)
Sec. 38-153. - Principles of systems layout.
Streets extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad right-of-way should be at a:
(1)
Sufficient distance to ensure depth for commercial or industrial sites; and
(2)
Distance at least 50 feet from the railroad right-of-way when intersecting a street that crosses the railroad at grade, or be at such other distance as shall be necessary when intersecting a street that will be grade separated when crossing the railroad.
Streets designed in new subdivisions or new phases of existing subdivisions within 500 feet of an existing roadway, the proposed roadway must be designed to connect to the existing roadway.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-153; Res. No. LD05-A033, 9-19-2005)
Sec. 38-154. - Phased developments.
(a)
Joint consideration of the factors of both emergency access and capacity shall follow layouts for access to phased developments as follows:
(1)
Provide at least two separate roadways fully connected to the internal system of roadways; or
(2)
Provide a divided-type entrance roadway with a median of sufficient width to largely ensure freedom of continued emergency access by lanes on one side. The required median width shall range from 12 to 30 feet as required by the site in question.
(b)
Phased developments are allowed to have one phase that does not meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, but the next phase shall bring the previous phase into compliance. Only one phase at a time is allowed not to be in compliance with this section.
(c)
Future streets to be extended or started and being shown on the current plan proposed are to be constructed to the ends of all proposed lots. An example is where a new street is to be built in a later phase between two lots. This street is to be built to the rear property line of the two lots during the phase which create those lots.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-154)
Sec. 38-155. - Easements standards.
(a)
Easements shall be arranged in such a manner as to eliminate unnecessary easement jogs or offsets and to facilitate the use of easements for power distribution, telephone service, drainage, water service, sewer service and pedestrian access.
(b)
No half easements shall be accepted unless the adjacent property owner dedicates the other half of the easement at the same time that the plat is approved.
(c)
Easements shall be cleared of trees, debris and other materials unless it is determined by the manager of development services that such materials do not hinder the effectiveness of the easements.
(d)
Easements for the location of garbage receptacles and for ingress and egress to such receptacles, together with fences and other screens, shall be provided when in the opinion of the manager of development services such easements and fences or screens are necessary to provide adequate garbage collection services to the proposed development.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-155)
Sec. 38-156. - Utility easements.
(a)
Easements at least ten feet wide, five feet wide on each side of side lot lines shall be provided for utilities for utility service to those lots only.
(b)
Easements at least 15 feet wide shall be provided along all rights-of-way of new roads and along the frontages of new developments and subdivisions developed on existing roads.
(c)
Public water and sanitary sewer easements, if determined by the utilities authority to be necessary shall be required. Easement placement and widths will be determined by the utilities authority.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-156)
Sec. 38-157. - Storm drainage easements.
(a)
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, natural channel or stream that conveys stormwater from other adjoining county rights-of-way or easements, there shall be provided a right-of-way conforming substantially to the limits of such watercourse plus additional width as necessary to accommodate future construction and/or maintenance as determined by the manager of development services.
(b)
Any manmade drainage systems, excluding planned community lakes unless they are a designed part of the storm drainage system, shall provide rights-of-way or easements conforming substantially to the limits of the system plus additional width as necessary to accommodate maintenance as determined by the manager of development services.
(c)
No buildable lot shall be subdivided for development with a stormwater detention/retention easement contained within the bounds of the property.
(d)
All stormwater detention/retention areas shall be conveyed to the board of commissioners in fee simple title.
(e)
Any drainage systems deeded to the county shall have access rights-of-way conveyed with it to provide legal ingress and egress for county personnel to carry out maintenance duties. Such access shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width.
(f)
For areas on lots where fill material is placed to eliminate the ponding of stormwater, the displaced stormwater shall be directed to a designated right-of-way or easement and the design storm calculations shall allow for the increase in projected storm runoff.
(g)
All stormwater drainage systems conveying stormwater directly from a road right-of-way to a retention/detention pond shall convey the stormwater through a closed system consisting of acceptable pipe sized to handle the calculated volume of stormwater.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-157)
Sec. 38-158. - Subdivision lot requirements.
(a)
Reference markers.
(1)
At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance from a readily discernable reference marker such as a lot intersection marker or the intersection of two existing streets. If a corner lies within 500 feet of triangulation or traverse station of the state coordinate system this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computer X and Y coordinates which shall also appear on the map with a statement identifying the location of this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000.
(2)
All other intersections and lot corners shall be marked with iron pipes not less than three-fourths inch in diameter or iron rebar not less than one-half inch in diameter. Both marker types shall be not less than 24 inches long and driven so as to be flush with the finished grade. The above standards shall also apply to any revision or addition to an existing subdivision.
(3)
The lots shall be marked in the field by the appropriate number as shown on the proposed subdivision plat. Such marking shall be in the form of stakes along each street front property corner.
(b)
Lot layout.
(1)
Side lot lines shall be as perpendicular to the right-of-way tangent as possible. In no circumstances shall the angle between the side lot line and the right-of-way tangent be less than 70 degrees.
(2)
The lot arrangement shall be such that there shall be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the county's ordinances and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved public street.
(Ord. of 9-18-2000(2), § 38-158)
DIVISION 2. - PLANNING AND LAND DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.

Sec. 38-159. - Placement of utilities.
(a)
Every pipe or conduit for gas, communication or other use shall have a minimum cover of 24 inches.
(b)
Where feasible and appropriate, utility companies shall indicate the locations of their undersurface structures by means of surface markings. Curb markings are an excellent method of indicating where a pipe intersects the pavement.
(c)
Utilities in easement adjacent to roadway:
(1)
Lee county shall be granted exclusive utility easements parallel to all new roads accepted by the county and well as on the frontage of new developments on existing roads to a width of 15 feet beyond the right-of-way line. These easements shall be cleared at the time of road construction, unless otherwise authorized by the manager of development services, to allow access for utility companies to install their lines and accessories.
(2)
Wherever a utility easement crosses a drainage easement or right-of-way no structures shall be placed within the bounds of the drainage easement or right-of-way unless authorized in writing by the county with the condition that the structures are to be removed from the easement if they interfere with the repair, or maintenance of the easement or right-of-way.
