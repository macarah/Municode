k.
To reduce the amount of rain water run-off from entering the sanitary sewer system through the sump grate inlet the concrete pad shall be designed so that the rain water from the surrounding parking lot does not enter the enclosure. This may be accomplished by raising the concrete pad above the adjacent parking lot grade or, by sloping the pad to shed storm water away from the front opening of the enclosure. Spot elevations shall be shown for the dumpster pads.
(3)
Appropriate lane width and turning radius shall be incorporated in the site construction plans for the refuse removal vehicle to access the dumpster receptacle and to exit the property safely.
