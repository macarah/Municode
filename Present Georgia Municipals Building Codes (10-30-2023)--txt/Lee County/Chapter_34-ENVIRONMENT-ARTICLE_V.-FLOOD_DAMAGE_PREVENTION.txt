Editor's note— Ord. of Aug. 27, 2009, amended Art. V, §§ 34-216—34-257, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Art. V, §§ 34-216—34-257, pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table.

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

Sec. 34-216. - Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the state has in Georgia Code Annotated, Article IX, Section II, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners does ordain as follows.
(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-217. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of Lee County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-218. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-219. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)
To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-220. - Restrictions on developments in floodplain.
In all special flood hazard areas (SFHA) as shown on the [flood] insurance rate maps (FIRM), the following provisions apply:
(1)
New construction of principal buildings (both residential and nonresidential), including manufactured homes, shall not be allowed if any portion of the structure lies within the limits of the "floodway."
(2)
All structures to be located within the 100-year zone "AE" floodplain boundaries or 500-year gray shaded zone "X" floodplain boundaries immediately adjacent to the 100-year zone "AE" shall have approved plans for the construction of such structure that evidences that such structure shall be located upon a lot having a minimum of two acres of land legally subdivided prior to a building permit being issued. All structures located in the 100-year zone "AE" floodplain boundaries shall have the first finished floor elevated to at least three feet above the 100-year base flood elevation. All structures located in the 500-year gray shaded zone "X" floodplain boundaries immediately adjacent to the 100-year zone "AE" shall have the first finished floor elevated to at least one foot above the 100-year zone "AE" base flood elevation. An official elevation certificate shall be submitted at time of building permit application attesting to the fact that the finished floor elevation shall be at least at or above the required elevation.
Exemption: An owner of any lot already legally subdivided and approved by October 1, 2005 will be allowed to apply for a building permit under the relevant applicable provisions for construction on such lot that were applicable immediately prior to October 1, 2005. If a building permit is issued under the provisions of this exemption, a structure may be built in the floodplain under such provisions relating to such construction as were applicable immediately prior to October 1, 2005, providing the construction meets all of the other requirements for then-existing development procedures for construction under the floodplain development ordinance of the county.

(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-247. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-246(4).
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
(2)

The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 34-243(6).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. subsection 34-246(6) above).
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be on the site for fewer than 90 consecutive days,
2.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or
3.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)(a) and (c), above.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-228, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.
Only if subsection (4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.
(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-248. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-228, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 34-228, then the zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2), (3) shall apply:
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-247(4).
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

Sec. 34-249. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO-Zones).
Areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-228, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-246(4).
The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 34-242(1)(c) and (2).
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-250. - Standards for subdivisions.
(a)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(b)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(c)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
(d)
Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter or map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

Sec. 34-251. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways.
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-228, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 34-247.
(Ord. of 8-27-2009)
Sec. 34-252. - Standards for critical facilities.
(a)
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain.
(b)
All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCES

Sec. 34-256. - Variance procedures.
(a)
The board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article.
(b)
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to Lee County Superior Court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this section are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
