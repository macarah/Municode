The chairperson and the vice-chairperson of the commission shall be ex officio members of the governing board and shall be permitted to deliberate on all actions of the governing board (excluding his or her appointment), but shall not be a voting member of the governing board and shall not be counted to establish the quorum required to take action. The governing board shall elect from its members a chairperson and a vice-chairperson, each to serve for a term of one calendar year and until a successor is elected, and who shall be eligible for reelection to such office. The executive director of the consolidated planning commission (or other person designated by the governing board) shall serve as secretary of the governing board, and shall perform such duties in connection with said office as may be designated by the governing board from time to time. The governing board shall meet biannually at the call of the chairperson of the governing board, and at such other times as the chairperson of the governing board or a majority of governing board members shall determine.
(b)
Subject to the protections of sovereign and official immunity (and other doctrines and laws of the state), the commission shall be solely liable and responsible for its actions and those of the personnel retained to discharge its obligations and services under this article. In this connection, the commission shall employ an executive director and such other employees as the executive director may recommend and be approved by the governing board. More specifically, the executive director shall have the responsibility of retaining, disciplining, evaluating, discharging, and otherwise managing the personnel of the commission; provided that all such decisions shall be reviewable by the governing board as provided in any subsequently enacted personnel policies that may be established by the executive director and approved by the governing board. Notwithstanding that the executive director shall be deemed employed by the commission, he shall be retained, disciplined, evaluated, discharged and otherwise supervised by the governing board. In particular, and not by way of limitation, any personnel action pertaining to the executive director shall require a majority vote of the entire governing board, as well as the affirmative vote of each representative of a member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of 20 percent or more (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement). For purposes of this article and all other circumstances, the governing board shall be deemed a component and part of the consolidated planning commission (but not subject to its control), and shall have supervisory powers over its personnel as generally set forth in this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the governing board shall have no involvement in or influence over the recommendations made or other functions performed by the commission unless specifically authorized herein; provided that all decisions regarding the personnel of the commission shall be determined and managed by the governing board and the executive director as generally set forth in this section or as provided in any subsequently enacted personnel policies that may be established by the executive director and approved by the governing board.
(c)
To assist the governing board in budget and personnel decisions, a standing executive committee of the governing board shall be established that consists of the representative of each member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of 20 percent or more (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement), one representative of a member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of less than 20 percent (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement), the chairperson of the consolidated planning commission, and the vice-chairperson of the consolidated planning commission. The chairperson and the vice-chairperson of the commission shall be ex officio members of the executive committee and shall be permitted to deliberate on all actions of the governing board (excluding any appointments or personnel actions relating to the executive director), but shall not be a voting member of the executive committee and shall not be counted to establish the quorum required to take action. The governing board shall elect from the members of the executive committee a chairperson and a vice-chairperson of the executive committee, each to serve for a term of one calendar year and until a successor is elected, and who shall be eligible for reelection to such office. The executive director of the consolidated planning commission (or other person designated by the governing board) shall serve as secretary of the executive committee, and shall perform such duties in connection with said office as may be designated by the executive committee from time to time. The executive committee shall meet at the call of the chairperson of the executive committee, and at such other times as the chairperson of the executive committee or a majority of members shall determine.
(d)
This executive committee shall review all budgets proposed by the executive director and make recommendations to the governing board, who shall approve the final budget and any modifications. The executive committee shall evaluate the performance of the executive director, screen candidates for the executive director when the position is vacant, and recommend any personnel actions relating to the executive director to the governing board for approval. In particular, and not by way of limitation, any personnel action recommended by the committee pertaining to the executive director, or any other personnel, shall require a majority vote of the entire executive committee, as well as the affirmative vote of each representative of a member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of 20 percent or more (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement).
(Code 1987, § 14-4; Ord. No. 2004-005, § I, 12-7-2004; Ord. No. 2009-003, § I, 7-7-2009)
Sec. 32-24. - Commission membership.
The commission shall consist of nine members who shall be residents of the county and who shall be appointed by the governing board as provided in this article. The governing board shall appoint no more than four residents of any one municipality within the county, and no more than four residents of the unincorporated areas of the county, to serve as members of the commission. No member of the commission shall be an employee or elected official of any participating local government. All members shall serve until their successors are appointed.

The governing board, in its sole discretion, shall determine what the professional background of any member is and whether a member satisfies any requirements set forth in this subsection.

Those members of the commission appointed by the governing board and serving as of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall continue for the term of their office and until their successors are appointed.
(3)
Quorum; voting. With respect to both the governing board and the commission, an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of each such body, entitled to vote, and present shall be sufficient to permit the conduct of all business; provided, however, that in the event such affirmative majority vote of the membership of such body is made impossible due to either:
a.
Temporary vacancy on the board; or
b.
Refusal of any member due to a conflict of interest as determined by such member.
An affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining members of such body not otherwise unable to participate as set forth in subsections (3)a. and (3)b. of this section shall be sufficient to permit the conduct of all business.
(4)
Vacancies. Any vacancy in the membership of the commission arising at any time and from any cause, including, without limitation, the authorization of an increase in the number of members, or the death, resignation, incapacity, or removal of any incumbent member shall be filled for the unexpired term by the governing board.
(5)
Removal. The governing board may remove any member of the commission for due cause after written notice and a public hearing. Without limiting the foregoing, the governing board may consider for removal any member of the commission who is absent from three consecutive regular meetings of the commission or more than one-third of the commission's meetings, regular or special, that occur within a calendar year. The governing board may elect not to remove a member on the grounds of excessive absence if that member demonstrates that their absence was for good cause as determined by the governing board or if such absence is otherwise excused by the laws of the state. The findings and determinations of the governing board with respect to such matters shall be conclusive and absolute.
