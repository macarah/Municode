This plan is intended to provide a governmental qualified defined benefit pension plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) and 414(d). The benefits described in the plan are provided for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries. The plan shall be maintained at city hall. Certain provisions of this plan may be effective as of dates earlier or later than January 1, 2015, and shall be so designated.

Sec. 2-147. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Accrued benefit means the retirement income to which a participant will be entitled at his normal retirement age, based upon the actual number of years of service completed by the participant as of the date of determination and his compensation (if applicable) in those years of service.
Actuarial equivalent or actuarial equivalence means, with respect to a benefit calculated under this plan, any benefit that has the same present value on the date the benefit payment commences, using a seven percent interest rate per annum and the unisex mortality table in effect on the date benefits commence, as proscribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code Section 417(e)(3). Effective prior to January 1, 2010, the plan used a seven percent interest rate per annum and a 50 percent and 50 percent blend of the 1983 Group Annuity Table for males and females.
Authorized leave of absence means any temporary layoff or any absence authorized by the employer under the employer's standard personnel practices provided that all persons under similar circumstances must be treated alike in the granting of such authorized leaves of absence and provided further that the participant returns within the period of authorized absence.

Average monthly compensation means the average of the participant's compensation over the 36 consecutive months within the most recent ten-year period of service which produces the highest such average; provided however if an employee has not been employed continuously in service, his separate periods of service will be aggregated for purposes of this section as if he has been employed in service continuously during such aggregated period. If the employee's aggregated period of service is less than three years as of his date of termination of employment, his average monthly compensation will be determined as his average monthly compensation for his entire period of service. The following rules shall be applied to determine a participant's average monthly compensation:
(1)
Only compensation earned or deemed to have been earned during a period for which the participant is receiving service or is an eligible employee may be counted towards average monthly compensation.
(2)
Compensation shall be counted in the year paid, even if earned in a prior year.
(3)
Only compensation earned or deemed to have been earned before January 1, 2018, may be counted towards average monthly compensation. No compensation earned on or after January 1, 2018, shall be taken into account in determining a participant's accrued benefit under the plan.
Beneficiary means any individual(s), trust, estate or other entity or entities designated by the participant in accordance with procedures established by the plan administrator to receive any death benefits under the plan. Any beneficiary designation shall be void if the participant revokes the designation. If a married participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated non-spouse primary beneficiary fails to survive the participant and the participant has not designated a contingent beneficiary, or if both the designated non-spouse primary beneficiary and contingent beneficiary fail to survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be (a) the participant's eligible spouse, or; (b) if no eligible spouse is alive, the participant's eligible dependent(s), or (c) if no eligible dependents, the participant's estate. If an unmarried participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary fails to survive the participant and the participant has not designated a contingent beneficiary, or if both the designated beneficiary and contingent beneficiary fail to survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be the participant's eligible dependents, if any, and if none, the participant's estate.
For the purposes of this section, revocation of prior beneficiary designations will occur when a participant files a new valid designation with the plan administrator.

Except with respect to qualified participants (as defined below), in no event shall the compensation of a participant taken into account under the plan for any plan year exceed (i)$200,000.00 for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, (ii) $150,000.00 for plan years on or after the later of (a) January 1, 1996 or (b) the 90th day after the opening of the first legislative session that begins on or after January 1, 1996, or (iii) for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the limitations of Code Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year (i.e., $265,000.00 for 2015). For purposes of applying the $150,000.00 limit for the 1996 plan year, if any employee is the spouse or a lineal descendant of an employee (provided the lineal descendant is younger than age 19 by the end of the plan year) who is one of the ten "highly compensated employees" (within the meaning of Code Section 414(q)) paid the greatest amount of earnings (determined without regard to the $150,000.00 limit, as adjusted) during the plan year, the employee shall not be treated as a separate employee.
The limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall be subject to adjustment annually as provided in Code Section 401(a)(17)(B) and Code Section 415(d); provided, however, that the dollar increase in effect on January 1 of any calendar year, if any, is effective for the plan year.

If a participant's employment terminates on account of his death after his retirement income has commenced in an optional form, his beneficiary shall receive the benefits determined under the option selected.
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 5, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2014-142, § 3, 2-4-2014; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 5, 1-5-2016)

(a)
Payment of retirement income.
(1)
Monthly payments. The retirement income payable for normal, early or late retirement shall be payable on the first day of each month and shall begin on the normal, early or late retirement date as applicable; provided however, a participant will not be considered to have retired and will not be eligible to commence receipt of benefits of his early retirement income as long as he continues to be employed by the employer or if he is reemployed by the employer (prior to his normal retirement date) within 90 days of his termination of employment.
(2)
Benefit commencement date. Normal, early or late retirement income payments shall not commence earlier that the first day of the month following the date on which the participant's complete application for a benefit is filed at the office of the plan administrator; provided however, payment must commence by the required beginning date.
(3)
Death of participant before payments begin. If a participant dies before his retirement income payments are effective, no benefits shall be payable under the plan except as provided in section 2-150.
(b)
Normal form of payment. The normal form of payment shall be a life annuity option, which is a monthly retirement income payable to the participant during the participant's lifetime, with payments ceasing upon the participant's death. All benefit formulas in this plan shall give the amount of the participant's retirement income if it is paid in the life annuity option, beginning at the participant's normal retirement date.
(c)
Optional forms of payment.
(1)
Optional forms available. A participant may elect to receive any of the optional forms of payment listed below, in lieu of the normal form of payment. The selection of an optional form of benefit shall be final and binding upon the participant and his beneficiary on the date the participant's retirement income commences, except as otherwise provided below.
a.
One hundred and twenty months certain and life option. This is a reduced monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant during his lifetime and, in the event of the participant's death within a period of 120 months after the commencement of benefits, the same monthly amount shall be payable to the participant's beneficiary for the remainder of such 120 month period.
b.
Joint and survivor annuity option. This is a reduced monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option.

Such retirement income shall cease on the later of the death of the participant or the death of the participant's beneficiary.
c.
Death of beneficiary. If the participant's beneficiary or joint annuitant dies before the participant's retirement income begins, any optional form elected by the participant will be cancelled and the participant will receive retirement income in the normal form unless the participant makes a new election for an optional form with a new beneficiary or joint annuitant.
d.
Social Security option. This is an increased monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant for his life until his social security benefits commence and a reduced retirement income payable thereafter for his life, so that combined social security benefits and retirement income payments are essentially level.
e.
Death [of] the participant and beneficiary. If both the participant and the beneficiary die after the date the participant's retirement income payment becomes effective but before full payment has been made, any guaranteed payment shall be paid to a contingent beneficiary and if the commuted value of the remaining payments is less than $5,000.00, such payment shall automatically be made in a lump sum.
(2)
Lump sum option. If the present value of the total amount due to the participant or beneficiary is $10,000.00 or less, the participant or beneficiary may elect to receive payment in a single lump sum payment.
(3)
Minimum distribution incidental benefit rules. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.401(a)(9)-2. This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental.
(d)
Small lump sum payments. If the monthly amount of the total retirement income (including that of a pre-retirement survivor annuity or disability payment) to be paid is less than $100.00 per month as of the date the retirement income payments are first effective or as of the date of death of the participant, then the single sum actuarial equivalent of such retirement income shall be paid in a lump sum to the participant or beneficiary, as applicable without their consent.

The participant's 65 birthday;
b.
The tenth anniversary of the date the participant commenced participation in this plan; or
c.
The participant's termination of employment.
(2)

The required beginning date shall be April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the participant attains age 70½ or (ii) the calendar year in which the participant terminates employment.
(3)
Effective date. The rules set forth in this section 2-151(e) shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003 even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003.
(4)
No extension of death benefits or payment forms. Nothing in this section 2-151(e) shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This section 2-151(e) shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with this section 2-151(e), Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder.
For purposes of this section 2-151(e), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Participant before the participant's required beginning date, or to the participant's spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under section 2-151(e)(7)b below, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
(5)
Period of distribution. The entire interest of each participant in this plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date described in paragraph (2) above, over the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary.
(6)
Death of participant after distribution has begun. If distribution of a participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (2) above (i.e., distributions on or after the required beginning date), and if the participant dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (2) as of the date of the participant's death.
(7)
Death of participant before distribution has begun. If a participant dies before distribution of the participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (2) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the required beginning date), the entire interest of the participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable:
a.
If one or more designated beneficiary(ies) is not the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy.
b.
If the sole designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the spouse's remaining life expectancy.
c.
If there is no designated beneficiary, the entire account shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.
Distributions under this subsection (e)(7) shall commence as follows:
i.
Distributions under 2-151(e)(7)(a.), (i.e., distribution to a non-spouse designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the participant died.
ii.
Distributions under section 2-151(e)(7)(b.) (i.e., distribution solely to a spousal designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70½.
(8)
Form of distribution. For a participant who is employed by an employer after his required beginning date, any distribution payable under this section 2-151(e) may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements:
a.
The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the regulations.
b.
The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year.
c.
If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed.
d.
Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1, or any successor regulation thereto.
e.
All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1.
f.
Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section 2-151(e). If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations.
For purposes of this section 2-151(e), references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the participant and the designated beneficiary.
(9)
Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection 2-151(e)(7)(a.) or (b.) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the Participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date.
(10)
Lump sum distributions. In the case of a lump sum distribution from this plan that is distributed in or after the calendar year in which the participant attains or would have attained age 70½, the amount of the lump sum that equals the participant's or designated beneficiary's required minimum distribution and thus is not an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of section 2-151(h) of the plan shall be determined using either of the methods set forth in the regulations. The plan administrator shall have the sole discretion to elect the calculation method but shall apply the same method to all lump sum distributions made in the same calendar year.
(11)
Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a non-spouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations.
(12)
Actuarial increase after age 70½.
a.
A participant's accrued benefit shall be actuarially increased to take into account the period after age 70½ in which the employee does not receive any benefits under the plan. The actuarial increase shall commence on April 1 following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70½, and end on the date on which benefits commence after retirement in an amount sufficient to satisfy Code Section 401(a)(9).
The accrued benefit payable to such a participant as of the end of the period for which the actuarial increase is required shall not be less than:
i.
The actuarial equivalent of the employee's accrued benefit as of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attained age 70½, plus
ii.
The actuarial equivalent of any additional benefits accrued after the date described in (i) above, less
iii.
The actuarial equivalent of any distributions made with respect to the participant's accrued benefit after such date.
b.
The actuarial increase described above may reduce the benefit accrual otherwise required under Code Section 411(b)(1)(H)(i).
c.
The actuarial adjustment described above shall be made even during a period for which benefits are suspended pursuant to section 2-152.
(13)
Plan administrator's discretion. The plan administrator shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this section 2-151(e) to any benefit option elected by the participant. The plan administrator may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules.
(14)
Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section 2-151(e) notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary.
a.
Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the Beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each Beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan.
b.
Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "spouse" as defined in the regulations. Nothing in this section 2-151(e) shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan.
c.
Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices, other regulations and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto.
d.
Distribution calendar year. "Distribution calendar year" is a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year that contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to subsection 2-151(e)(7)(i) and (ii).
e.
Life expectancy. "Life expectancy" shall mean the period computed by the use of the single life table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations.
(f)
Small payments. Effective as to distributions that occur on and after January 1, 2006, if (i) the amount of a distribution is more than $1,000.00, and (ii) the participant does not affirmatively elect to receive the distribution directly or to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan pursuant to section 2-151(h), then the plan administrator will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the plan administrator.
(g)
Payment to minors and incapacitated persons. If any amount is payable to a minor or to any person who, in the judgment of the plan administrator, is incapable of making proper disposition thereof, such payment shall be made for the benefit of such minor or such person in any of the following ways as the plan administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine:
(1)
By payment to the legal representative of such minor or such person;
(2)
By payment directly to such minor or such person;
(3)
By payment in discharge of bills incurred by or for the benefit of such minor or such person. The board shall make such payments as directed by the plan administrator without the necessary intervention of any guardian or like fiduciary, and without any obligation to require bond or to see to the further application of such payment. Any payment so made shall be in complete discharge of the plan's obligation to the participant and his beneficiaries.
(h)
Direct Rollover.
(1)
Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2)
Definitions.
a.
Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); and (iii) for distributions before January 1, 2002, the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities.) The plan administrator may prohibit a distributee's election of a direct rollover with respect to an eligible rollover distribution during the plan year that is less than $200.00. If the distributee elects to have only a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan, the plan administrator may require that portion to equal at least $500.00.
b.
Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a), an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, provided that such account, annuity, contract, plan or trust accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective as of January 1, 2008, eligible retirement plan shall include a Roth IRA established under Code Section 408A.
c.
Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. For distributions on and after January 1, 2007, "distributee" shall include a non-spouse beneficiary of an eligible rollover distribution to the extent permitted by Code Section 402(c)(11).
d.
Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
e.
Special rules for rollovers of after-tax contributions. To the extent that an eligible rollover distribution includes amounts that are not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), such an amount shall constitute an eligible rollover distribution to the extent that (i) it is transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a qualified trust or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), and such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includible, or (ii) such portion is transferred to an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract).

Sec. 2-152. - Suspension of benefits.
(a)
This section 2-152 shall apply to any participant who (i) retired or otherwise terminated employment under the provisions of this plan (ii) is receiving, has received, or was entitled to receive retirement income hereunder, and (iii) returns to employment with the employer. Such participant shall be subject to the following provisions:
(1)
The participant shall not be entitled to receive during such period of reemployment any retirement income to which the participant might otherwise be entitled under this plan; provided, however, that retirement income for a given calendar month will not be suspended if the participant has attained his normal retirement age.
(2)
The participant shall be treated like any other participant who terminated employment and was rehired (ignoring the fact that he may have retired and was receiving retirement income) and, to the extent provided in section 2-149(f), shall be given credit for service earned after reemployment and prior to his subsequent retirement. The period during which he was retired or was not employed by the employer shall not be included as service unless otherwise required by section 2-149(f).
(3)
If the participant dies during the time of his reemployment and such participant has previously received retirement income, then any death benefit to which the participant's beneficiary shall be entitled shall be determined under the form of payment previously elected by the participant pursuant to section 2-151 and computed as described in subparagraph (4) below. If the participant had not previously received retirement income, then any death benefit shall be determined under section 2-150 of the plan (with the participant's accrued benefit first recomputed under subparagraph (4) below).
(4)
The retirement income payable on the participant's subsequent termination of employment shall be made under the form of payment in effect (if any) prior to his reemployment and shall equal the greatest of a, b, or c below.
a.
The retirement income payable to the participant shall be determined in accordance with section 2-149 based upon his compensation before his prior termination of employment and after his rehire (to the extent permitted under the definition of compensation) and by aggregating his service before his prior termination of employment with his service after his rehire. The retirement income so determined shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any retirement income previously paid to the participant.
b.
If the participant's subsequent termination of employment occurs after the participant's normal retirement date, the participant's monthly retirement income shall be adjusted in the manner described in section 2-149(c).
c.
The monthly retirement income payable to the participant shall not be less than the monthly retirement income the participant was receiving or was entitled to receive prior to his earlier termination of employment.
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 7, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 7, 1-5-2016)
Sec. 2-153. - Method of financing.
(a)
Employer contributions.
(1)
The employer shall contribute to the trust fund from time to time such amounts as the plan administrator shall determine, based upon the recommendations of an actuary, in order to fund the benefits provided hereunder on an actuarially sound basis. All employer contributions when made to the trust fund and all property and funds of the trust fund, including income from investments and from all other sources, shall be retained for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries and shall be used to pay retirement income provided hereunder or to pay expenses of administration of the plan and the trust fund.
(2)
All contributions are conditioned upon the initial qualification of the plan under Code Section 401(a). Upon an employer's request and to the extent permitted by the Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, a contribution shall be returned to the employer within one year after the denial of the plan's initial qualification. Upon an employer's request and to the extent permitted by the Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, a contribution which was made by a mistake in fact shall be returned to the employer within one year after the payment of the contribution.
(b)
Participant contributions.
(1)
Each participant shall contribute three and one-half percent of compensation until January 31, 2005, and four and two-tenths percent thereafter.
(2)
Effective January 1, 2002, the participant contributions described in this section, although designated as participant contributions, are being paid by the employer as "pick-up" contributions in accordance with Code Section 414(h). As such, these contributions are mandatory and no participant is entitled under any circumstances to receive such contributions in cash in lieu of having them contributed to the plan. Such contributions shall be 100 percent vested for all purposes under the plan.
(3)
Effective on and after January 1, 2018, no participant contributions shall be made to the plan.
(c)
Miscellaneous.
(1)
Any actuarial gains arising from actuarial experience under the plan shall be used to reduce the employer contributions and will not be used to increase any benefits payable under this plan. No forfeiture arising from severance of employment, death or for any other reason, shall be applied to increase the benefits any participant would otherwise receive under the plan at any time prior to the termination of the plan or the complete discontinuance of employer contributions hereunder, but all amounts so forfeited shall be used as soon as possible to reduce the employer contributions under the plan.
(2)
No person shall have any interest in or right to the fund or any part thereof except as expressly provided in the plan.
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 8, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 8, 1-5-2016; Ord. No. 2017-190, § 5, 10-17-2017)
Sec. 2-154. - Plan termination.
(a)
The employer expects this plan to be continued indefinitely but reserves the right to terminate the plan and its contributions hereunder at any time by action of city council. In the event that it becomes necessary to terminate or partially terminate the plan, then the accrued benefit of each affected participant (within the meaning of Code Section 411(d)(3)), to the extent funded, shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable as of the date of such termination or partial termination in the manner hereinafter provided in this section 2-154.
(b)
If the employer elects to terminate the plan, the city council shall give written notice of such fact to the board of trustees and the plan administrator for the plan. Thereafter the board and the plan administrator shall prepare a list of all participants showing for each, as of the date of plan termination, the following:
(1)
The amount and payment terms of all benefits currently being paid to each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant;
(2)
The amount, payments terms and commencement date of benefits for terminated participants entitled to benefits under the plan; and,
(3)
The accrued benefit of each active participant.
(c)
The board shall prepare a statement of the liquidated value of the assets held in the trust fund. The employer, in its sole discretion may request the board to arrange for the liquidation of all plan assets and may direct the board to purchase fully paid-up annuity contracts to provide the benefits to which each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant is entitled or to pay a lump sum to each such participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant equal to the actuarial equivalent of the retirement benefits to which each is entitled.
(d)
If the plan assets are not sufficient to provide full benefits to each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant, the employer shall pay to the board, as soon as practical an amount equal to the total value of benefits payable over the total value of assets held in the trust.
(e)
Any residual assets of the plan remaining after distribution in accordance with the preceding paragraphs shall be distributed to the employer, provided:
(1)
All liabilities of the plan to participants and beneficiaries have been satisfied; and
(2)
The distribution does not contravene any provision of applicable law.

Sec. 2-157. - Section 415 limitations.
(a)
General rule.
(1)
The annual benefit under this plan payable to a participant at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount. "Maximum permissible amount" shall mean $160,000.00, such limitation to be adjusted automatically as determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for each calendar year, with the new limitation to apply to limitation years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment.

In addition, compensation shall be increased by the amount by which the participant's compensation is reduced by salary reduction or similar arrangement under Code Section 132(f)(4) (i.e., a qualified transportation fringe benefit program).
The annual compensation taken into account shall not exceed the limitations of Code Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year in which it is paid.
(4)
Amounts that would otherwise constitute "compensation" under (3) above but are paid from a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan sponsored by the employer nevertheless shall constitute "compensation" for purposes of the limitations in Code Section 415 in the year in which such amounts are actually received by the participant, but only to the extent such amounts are includible in the participant's gross income.
(5)
The following amounts also shall constitute "compensation" under (3) above if (a.) the amounts are paid by the later of two and one-half months after the participant's severance from employment with the employer or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the participant's severance from employment, and (b.) the amounts would have constitute compensation under (3) above if they were paid prior to the participant's severance from employment with the employer:
a.
Payment for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave, but only if the participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; and
b.
Amounts received by a participant pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the participant at the same time if the participant had continued in employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the participant's gross income.
