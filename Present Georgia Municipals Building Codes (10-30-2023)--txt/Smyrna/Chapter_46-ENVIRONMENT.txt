Sec. 46-5. - Graffiti control.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a program in addition to those already provided by state law for removal of graffiti from walls and structures on both public and private property and to prevent and control the further spread of graffiti in the city. The increase of graffiti on both public and private buildings, structures and places is creating a condition of blight within the city which results in deterioration of property affected as well as adjacent and surrounding properties, all to the detriment of the city.
The city council finds and determines that graffiti is detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare and constitutes a public nuisance, which must be abated so as to avoid the detrimental impact of such graffiti on the city and to prevent the further spread of graffiti. It is further the intent of the city council, through the adoption of this section, to give notice to all who disregard the property rights of others that the city will strictly enforce all laws prohibiting graffiti.
(b)
Definitions.
Graffiti means any unauthorized inscription, work, figure or design that is marked, etched, scratched, drawn, or painted on any surface of public or private building, structure, or place.
(c)
Declaration of nuisance. The city council finds and declares that the existence of graffiti anywhere within the boundaries of the City of Smyrna is a public and private nuisance, and may be abated according to the provisions and procedures contained in this section and other applicable laws.
(d)
Abatement at owner's expense. Graffiti located on privately or publicly owned property, within the City of Smyrna may be removed by the city at the owner's expense as a public nuisance, after service of a notice to abate as herein set forth. The expenses of such abatement may be recovered in accordance with subsections 46-5(h) and (i) herein.
(e)
Abatement by owner, occupant, or person in control of premises; notice to abate. Whenever the city is apprised of the presence of graffiti located on privately or publicly owned property within the City of Smyrna, the city may serve a written notice directing the owner, occupant, or other person or entity in control of the affected premises to abate such graffiti and advising of the appeal procedure. The notice to abate the graffiti shall be served in person or by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested. If the owner or occupant cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of three days. Unless an appeal is taken as provided in this article, it shall be unlawful for the owner, occupant, or other person or entity in control of the affected premises to fail to remove the graffiti within five days of the date that notice to abate the graffiti is served if service is made in person or by certified mail, or if service is made by posting the property as set forth herein, the owner or occupant shall remove the graffiti with five days of the first day that the property is posted.
(f)
Appeal procedure. Appeals may be taken to city council or its designee by the owner, occupant, or other person or entity in control of the affected premises to prevent the removal of any graffiti, within five days of having received notice from the city that the graffiti must be removed. Appeals shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the appeal. If the party filing the appeal requests a hearing, such hearing shall be held at the next scheduled official meeting of the city council. If, on appeal, the city council or its designee determines that the graffiti must be removed, council or its designee may set a new deadline date for compliance or authorize the city to proceed to remove or obscure the graffiti. The city shall not remove or obscure any graffiti during the pendencey of an appeal.
(g)
Abatement by the city at owner's expense; costs. If, after the notice of abatement is served, the graffiti is not completely abated by the owner or occupier of the premises within the time prescribed, and the appropriate party has not filed an appeal, the city administrator or his/her designated representative is authorized to cause the graffiti to be abated by the city personnel or private contractor, and the city, or its private contractor, are expressly authorized to enter upon the premises for such purposes and remove such graffiti.
The city administrator or his/her representative shall keep an account of the costs and expenses incurred in abating such graffiti and shall provide a statement of such costs to the person who received the notice to abate, and to the owner of the affected property. The owner and occupant of the premises shall be jointly liable to the city for any and all costs and expenses to the city involved in abating the graffiti.
If all or any portion of the costs and expenses incurred by the city in abating the graffiti and accounted for by the city administrator remain unpaid after 30 days, the same shall constitute a lien upon the real property and the city may file appropriate documentation evidencing such lien in the real estate records as maintained by the clerk of the Superior Court of Cobb County.
(h)
Cost of abatement a personal obligation. In lieu of making the cost of abating a nuisance a lien upon the real property, the city may sue in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover all such expenses incurred by the city in removing the graffiti including attorneys fees and court costs associated with the action.
(i)
Alternative means of enforcement. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the city council from authorizing the city attorney to commence any other available civil or criminal proceeding to abate a public nuisance under applicable provisions of state law or city ordinance as an alternative, or in addition to, proceedings set forth in this section.

Sec. 46-33. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(14) and (15) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
(14)
Except as provided in paragraph (15) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(15)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
1.
Stream crossings for water lines; or
2.
Stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. 2020-07 , 7-20-20)
Sec. 46-34. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the community development department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city engineer and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 46-33(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
(3)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 46-33(c)(14) and (15) of this article have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(6)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
(c)
Plan requirements.
(1)
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 46-33(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.

The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken.
(2)
No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 46-33(c)(14) and (15) of this article are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
(3)
Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
(4)
If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
(5)
The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
(6)
The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).
(Ord. No. 2020-07 , 7-20-20)
Sec. 46-35. - Inspection and enforcement.
(a)
The city will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
(b)
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
(c)
The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(d)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
(e)
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
(f)
The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.
(Ord. No. 2020-07 , 7-20-20)
Sec. 46-36. - Penalties and incentives.
(a)
Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
(b)
Stop-work orders.
(1)
For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;
(2)
For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and
(3)
All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
(4)
When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
(c)
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 46-34(b)(6) of this article. The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
(d)
Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

ARTICLE III. - CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER TRIBUTARY PROTECTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 46-60. - Title.
This article will be known as the "City of Smyrna Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Ordinance."
(Code 1977, § 19-21)
Sec. 46-61. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Area means the stream channel and the land area extending outward 20 horizontal feet from the center on either side of all flowing streams in the drainage basin of all tributaries of the Chattahoochee River which enter the Chattahoochee River downstream from Buford Dam and upstream from Sweetwater Creek, or greater as determined in site plan approval by the mayor and council where the size of the stream justifies a greater protection area. The protection area may be increased in size from time to time or at different locations as determined by the size of the stream and water flowage by mayor and council, and such designated changes shall be noted on the map of the protected areas within the city.
Flowing stream means any stream which is designated and shown as a permanent stream on the 7.5-minute quadrangle maps of the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, plus any stream which the mayor and council of the city may determine to be, and designate as, a flowing stream.
Land-disturbing activity means scraping, plowing, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, or filling of land or placement of any structure or impervious surface, dam, obstruction, or deposit.
Parcel means any plot, lot or acreage shown correctly as a unit on the latest county tax assessment records.
Person means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, entity, or authority and shall include their agents or contractors, the state, its political subdivisions and all its departments, boards, bureaus, commissions, or other agencies.
Protection area means the Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Area.
Watershed means the land area which drains into a particular stream.
(Code 1977, §§ 19-24, 19-25)
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 46-62. - Statutory authorization.
This article is adopted pursuant to the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-453.
(Code 1977, § 19-22)
Sec. 46-63. - Findings and purposes.
(a)
Findings. The mayor and council find that:
(1)
The Chattahoochee River provides multiple public benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta.
(2)
The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river.
(3)
Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including, but not limited to, pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperature are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries.
(4)
The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality.
(b)
Purposes. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation, and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Create vegetation buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage area of the Chattahoochee Corridor.
(2)
Minimize land-disturbing activities within such buffer areas by requiring issuance of a permit for such activities.
(Code 1977, § 19-23)
Sec. 46-64. - Establishment of tributary protection area.
The Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Area within the city is hereby established. The designated protection area shall be shown on the official map of the city.
(Code 1977, § 19-25)
Sec. 46-65. - Effectivity and validity.
(a)
Effectivity. This article shall become effective on March 5, 1985.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2022-04 , adopted March 7, 2022, repealed art. V, §§ 46-131—46-151, and enacted a new art. V as set out herein and later amended. While the provisions set out in Ord. No. 2022-04 were intended for use as §§ 46-140—46-159, those provisions have been included herein as §§ 46-131—46-151, at the editor's discretion, to avoid duplication of section numbers. Former art. V pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2021-19 , adopted November 1, 2021; and Ord. No. 2022-03 , adopted March 7, 2022.

Sec. 46-131. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
The impacts of post-development and redevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits;
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution;
Therefore, the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development and redevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development and redevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment stormwater runoff.
(Ord. No. 2022-04 , 3-7-22)
Sec. 46-132. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. Proper management of post-construction stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. Additionally, the city is required to comply with several state and federal laws, regulations and permits and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quality of post-construction stormwater runoff.

(1)
Design of stormwater management system. The design of the stormwater management system shall be in accordance with the applicable sections of the GSMM as directed by the administrator. Any design which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
(2)
Natural resources inventory. Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic, found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan, shall include, at a minimum (as applicable):
a.
Topography (minimum of two-foot contours) and steep slopes (i.e. areas with slopes greater than 15 percent);
b.
Natural drainage divides and patterns;
c.
Natural drainage features (e.g. swales, basins, depressional areas);
d.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors;
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas); and
f.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(3)
Better site design practices for stormwater management. Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
(4)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by the applicant through runoff reduction. To the extent subsection a., runoff reduction, has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then subsection b., water quality, shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
a.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first 1.0 inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
b.
Water quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 46-136, the city engineer or his/her designee may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(5)
Stream channel protection. Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
b.
Erosion prevention measures, such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and
c.
Preservation of any applicable stream buffer.
(6)
Overbank flood protection. Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to a rate at least ten percent less than the pre-development rate for all the following: the two-year, the ten-year and 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm events.
(7)
Extreme flood protection. Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to a rate at least ten percent less than the pre-development rate for both the 50-year and the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm events.
(8)
Trout stream protection. Trout stream protection shall be provided by controlling temperature for receiving waters with trout stream designation. In streams designated as primary trout waters by the wildlife resources division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures. In streams designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding two degrees Fahrenheit of natural stream temperatures.
(9)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(10)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the city engineer or his/her designee, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system.

(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured horizontally from the top of the stream bank as follows:
a.
Fifty feet from the banks of any state waters not defined on the current city stream buffer map, and as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action;
b.
Fifty feet of the banks of any stream in the city, as defined on the current city stream buffer map, and as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action where total watershed area (on site and off site area) intercepted is less than or equal to five square miles;
c.
Seventy-five feet of the banks of any stream in the city, as defined on the current city stream buffer map, and as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action where total watershed area (on site and off site area) intercepted is equal to five square miles and less than or equal to ten square miles;
d.
One hundred feet of the banks of any stream in the city, as defined on the current city stream buffer map, and as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action where total watershed area (on site and off site area) intercepted is greater than ten square miles;
(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited, on any stream in the city, as defined on the current city stream buffer map, and as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action where total watershed area (on site and off site area) intercepted is less than or equal to five square miles; grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within this setback.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted with or without conditions in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the community development department finds and determines that the requirements of this ordinance prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the license and variance board may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided above, the license and variance board shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the license and variance board. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within [the] city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way.
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship as determined at the sole discretion of the mayor and council.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and,
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and,
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
f.
Whether as a result of an exchange of buffer area the net buffer area is not reduced;
g.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

ARTICLE VII. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION

Sec. 46-170. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system;
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system;
Therefore, the city adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
