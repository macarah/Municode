(g)
General procurement standards and procedures. The Requesting Department shall procure all contracts in accordance with the requirements of this section of the policy.
(1)
Necessity. Purchases must be necessary to perform the scope of work and must avoid acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. The purchasing department and/or the requesting department should check with the federal surplus property agency prior to buying new items when feasible and less expensive. Strategic sourcing should be considered with other departments and/or agencies who have similar needs to consolidate procurements and services to obtain better pricing.
(2)
Clear specifications. All solicitations must incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the materials, products, or services to be procured, and shall include all other requirements which bidders must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals. Technical requirements must not contain features that restrict competition.
(3)
Notice of federal funding. All bid solicitations must acknowledge the use of federal funding for the contract. In addition, all prospective bidders or offerors must acknowledge that funding is contingent upon compliance with all terms and conditions of the funding award.
(4)
Compliance by contractors. All solicitations shall inform prospective contractors that they must comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, executive orders, and terms and conditions of the funding award.
(5)
Fixed price. Solicitations must state that bidders shall submit bids on a fixed price basis and that the contract shall be awarded on this basis unless otherwise provided for in this policy. Cost plus percentage of cost contracts are prohibited. Time and materials contracts are prohibited in most circumstances. Time and materials contracts will not be used unless no other form of contract is suitable and the contract includes a "not to exceed" amount. A time and materials contract shall not be awarded without express written permission of the federal agency or state pass-through agency that awarded the funds.
(6)
Use of brand names. When possible, performance or functional specifications are preferred to allow for more competition leaving the determination of how the reach the required result to the contractor. Brand names may be used only when it is impractical or uneconomical to write a clear and accurate description of the requirement(s). When a brand name is listed, it is used as reference only and "or equal" must be included in the description.
(7)
Lease versus purchase. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to perform an analysis of lease versus purchase alternatives to determine the most economical approach.
(8)
Dividing contract for M/WBE participation. If economically feasible, procurements may be divided into smaller components to allow maximum participation of small and minority businesses and women business enterprises. The procurement cannot be divided to bring the cost under bid thresholds or to evade any requirements under this policy.
(9)
Documentation. Documentation must be maintained by the purchasing department and/or the requesting department detailing the history of all procurements. The documentation should include the procurement method used, contract type, basis for contractor selection, price, sources solicited, public notices, cost analysis, bid documents, addenda, amendments, contractor's responsiveness, notice of award, copies of notices to unsuccessful bidders or offerors, record of protests or disputes, bond documents, notice to proceed, purchase order, and contract. All documentation relating to the award of any contract must be made available to the granting agency upon request.
(10)
Cost estimate. For all procurements costing $250,000.00 or more, the requesting department shall develop an estimate of the cost of the procurement prior to soliciting bids. Cost estimates may be developed by reviewing prior contract costs, online review of similar products or services, or other means by which a good faith cost estimate may be obtained. Cost estimates for construction and repair contracts may be developed by the project designer.
(11)
Contract requirements. The requesting department must prepare a written contract incorporating the provisions referenced in this policy.
(12)
Debarment. No contract shall be awarded to a contractor included on the federally debarred bidder's list.

Contractor oversight. The requesting department receiving the federal funding must maintain oversight of the contract to ensure that contractor is performing in accordance with the contract terms, conditions, and specifications.
(14)
Open competition. Solicitations shall be prepared in a way to be fair and provide open competition. The procurement process shall not restrict competition by imposing unreasonable requirements on bidders, including, but not limited to, unnecessary supplier experience, excessive or unnecessary bonding, specifying a brand name without allowing for "or equal" products, or other unnecessary requirements that have the effect of restricting competition.
(15)
Geographic preference. No contract shall be awarded on the basis of a geographic preference.
(16)
