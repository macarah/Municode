Sec. 2-5-49. - Article enforcement.
(a)
The department or its designee, in order to encourage the stabilization of the feral cat population in Floyd County and address complaints made by the public, shall have the following rights:
(1)
The right to trap, in a humane manner, and remove any cats: (1) which are demonstrating signs of rabies; (2) that are not spayed or neutered; (3) that are not identifiable as belonging to a feral cat colony that has a sponsor and a feral cat colony caregiver; (4) for public health or public safety concerns; or (5) that pose a nuisance to the public; and:
a.
If no issue of public health or safety exists or if any issues of public health and safety can be addressed by the removal and relocation of the cat to another area, a sponsor can arrange to have the cat spayed or neutered, ear-tipped and vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. The sponsor may then arrange for the cat to be adopted or placed in a feral cat colony; and
b.
If a feral cat is demonstrating signs of having rabies, has an illness or injury that presents an imminent danger to the public health, safety or to its own person, that cat shall be humanely destroyed.
(2)
The right to direct that a sponsor remove a feral cat that is creating a nuisance if the sponsor has failed to adequately resolve the nuisance within fourteen (14) days after being given written notice thereof. In the event that the department directs the sponsor to remove the cat, the sponsor shall have fourteen (14) days to do so. Failure of the sponsor to remove the cat within said time period (or such longer time as the department may specify) shall constitute grounds for the department to remove the cat.
(b)
Animal control officers or police officers shall investigate any nuisance complaint allegedly caused by a feral cat.
(l)
In the event that an animal control officer or police officer finds that a feral cat or feral cat colony has created a nuisance, the animal control officer or police officer shall advise the department and sponsor in writing of the nuisance; and
(2)
The sponsor shall have the right to review the matter with the director of the department. If the sponsor is not able to satisfy the director that a nuisance is not occurring, the sponsor shall have fourteen (14) days to comply with the director's direction with respect to correcting the nuisance. If the sponsor fails to correct the nuisance, the department shall have the right to remove the cat or issue summons for the violations.
(c)
If a sponsor fails to perform its responsibilities as defined in subsection 2-5-48(c) of this article, the department may notify the sponsor that it must comply with the requirements of this article within fourteen (14) days. If the sponsor fails to do so, the department may remove this sponsor from the list of department approved sponsors and may reassign the feral cat colonies from this sponsor to another sponsor or remove the colony.
(d)
If a feral cat colony caregiver regularly fails to comply with this article, the sponsor may notify the feral cat colony caregiver that he or she has thirty (30) days to make all reasonable efforts to fulfill the responsibilities defined in subsection 2-5-48(d) Feral cat colony caregiver responsibilities, of this article. If the feral cat colony caregiver fails to comply within that time period, the sponsor may identify and obtain replacement feral cat colony caregivers for the feral cat colonies of the non-compliant feral cat colony caregiver. If no other feral cat colony caregiver can be found within thirty (30) days, the sponsor shall notify the department and the department may humanely remove all, or parts of, the feral cat colonies and dispose of them in accordance with the enforcement of this article.
(e)
Feral cats who were spayed or neutered and vaccinated for rabies prior to the date on which this article became effective, shall be deemed to be in compliance with this article if all other requirements in section 2-5-48, Feral cat colonies, are being met by their feral cat colony caregivers. Feral cat colony caregivers shall take all appropriate and available steps to bring these cats into compliance with the provisions of this article within six (6) months of its enactment.
