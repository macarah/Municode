Sec. 111-2. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
Findings. The council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare, as well as an aesthetic nuisance.
(b)
Intent. By enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter, the council intends to:
(1)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan, which is expressly incorporated herein;
(3)
Protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens and others within the city;
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazard;
(5)
Promote the aesthetic qualities of the city;
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
Promote economic development;
(8)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(c)
Intent of sign regulations. Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this chapter, any sign authorized under this chapter can contain any commercial or noncommercial message.
(d)
Studies considered. In formulating the provisions of this chapter, the mayor and council considered and reviewed several studies concerning the relationship between highway advertising signs and traffic accidents including: "Safety and Environmental Design Considerations in the Use of Commercial Variable-Message Signage", "Research Review of Potential Safety Effects of Electronic Billboards on Driver Attention and Distraction", "Electronic Billboards and Highway Safety," and "Chapter 6 Road Signs and Advertising, Report of the Road Safety Committee on the Inquiry Into Driver Distraction."

Sec. 111-5. - Measurement of sign area and height.
(a)
Computation of sign area. In order to determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this chapter, the following shall establish how sign areas are measured. Unless otherwise specified as the area of a sign face or sign structure, the term "sign area" shall apply to both the sign face and structure.
(1)
Sign face area.
a.
The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of a sign face, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles delimiting each sign module, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
b.
For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign's face.
c.
For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign.
d.
The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign face or a sign module.
e.
Automatic or manual changeable copy signs. For any sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.
(2)
Sign structure area.
a.
The area of a sign structure shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face but are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature.
b.
For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign structure shall be the largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure.
c.
Project entrance signs. For project entrance signs or other signs that are imposed, mounted or painted on a wall or other decorative structure, the sign structure area shall be computed as that portion of such wall or other decorative structure that is discernibly devoted to the support of the sign or, by its design or architectural treatment, intended to provide a background or frame for the sign.
(3)
Treatment of open spaces. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign module, or sign structure.
(4)
Multi-faced signs.
a.
Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be the total area of all sides.
b.
Signs with three or more faces. For sign structures having only three faces and the interior angle formed between each of the faces is 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the area of the sign shall be the largest total of all faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees that can be viewed from any one direction.
(b)
Measurement of sign height and distance.
(1)
Sign height. The height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign, or from the crown of the roadway of the nearest street if the street is within 100 feet of any portion of the sign (when measured perpendicular to the street), to the highest point of any portion of the sign, whichever results in the greater sign height. Any earthen berms and elevated foundations supporting signs, signposts or other sign supports shall be included in the height of the sign.
(2)
Measurement of distance. Minimum distances required hereunder shall be measured along the shortest straight line from the nearest point on a sign structure to the nearest point on a property line, sign structure, building or structure to which the minimum distance requirement applies.
(Ord. of 5-8-2008, Â§ 7)

(3)
Any sign that was not lawfully erected in accordance with the sign regulations in effect at the time of the sign's construction, or was subsequently altered in a way inconsistent with the sign regulations in effect at the time of its alteration, is considered an illegal sign and shall not be granted legal nonconformity status. Illegal signs are subject to removal.

Removal of nonconforming signs. When a business or service is discontinued, all nonconforming signs relating to the business or service, including all nonconforming principal freestanding signs and sign structures and all nonconforming building signs, shall be removed after six months from the date of discontinuance.
(c)
Retention of legal nonconformity status.
(1)
A legal nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming designation and become an illegal sign if:

ARTICLE IV. - MURALS

Sec. 111-75. - Statement of purpose and intent.
new
A mural is a work of art painted otherwise directly applied on a building or wall. The presence of works of art, including murals, can be a key element to creating a visually satisfying environment for a community. The city is likely to attract commercial enterprises, permanent residents, and visitors if it improves and maintains its overall appearance. The residents ultimately will benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life if an attractive environment exists. The existence of works of art, such as murals, is an invaluable element to creating and maintain a visually appealing setting, which will promote economic development, advance the general prosperity of the community, and serve the general welfare. This is particularly true for the city, which has concentrated residential and commercial areas where murals are more readily noticed and appreciated than such works of art would be in municipalities with geographically large areas.
The purpose of this article is to recognize the following mural types:
(1)
Historic murals;
(2)
Original art murals; and
(3)
Limited message murals.
All other similar forms of outdoor visual art that do not meet the definitions of these three forms of murals set forth herein shall be regulated as wall signs under articles I, II, and III of this article pertaining to signs.
