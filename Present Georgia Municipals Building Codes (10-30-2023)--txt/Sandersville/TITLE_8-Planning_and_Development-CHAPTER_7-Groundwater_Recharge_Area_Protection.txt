CHAPTER 7 - Groundwater Recharge Area Protection

Sec. 8-7-1 - Title of the chapter, findings and objectives.
(a)
Title of chapter. This chapter shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of the City of Sandersville, Georgia.
(b)
Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within City of Sandersville, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources [that] are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface know as groundwater recharge areas.
Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(c)
Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. of 8/21/00(2))
Sec. 8-7-2 - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district.
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of City of Sandersville, Georgia that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition.
(Ord. of 8/21/00(2))
Sec. 8-7-3 - Pollution susceptibility.
All recharge areas within the City of Sandersville have a low pollution susceptibility, as indicated by the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
(Ord. of 8/21/00(2))
Sec. 8-7-4 - Permit requirements and enforcement.

The Building Official or designated appointee is hereby designated as the administrator and enforcement officer for this chapter.
b.
The Building Official or designated appointee shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.
c.
Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers shall have authority to assist the Building Official or designated appointee in enforcement.
d.
Any person who commits, takes part in or assists in any violation of any provision of this chapter shall be fined not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each offense. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
e.
The Building Official or designated appointee shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this chapter. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified in Section 8-7-6.
f.
When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of the chapter, the violator shall be required to remove the structure.
g.
When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this chapter, the violator shall be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable.
(2)
Permit review and site plan requirement. With the exception of certain exempted activities identified in Subsection 8-7-4(3), applications for a development permit within the groundwater recharge area district shall include a site plan. The following information is required for all site plans:
a.
A map or maps, drawn to a scale of one inch equals fifty (50) feet or other approved scale, showing all planned improvements including the width, depth and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, water courses and drainage ways, water lines, wastewater and storm water facilities, and utility installations, shall be provided by the applicant.
b.
Location, dimensions and areas of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site.
c.
The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body.
d.

g.
Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of said site plan.

Sec. 8-7-10 - Definitions.
Aquifer. Any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Groundwater recharge area. (Synonymous with aquifer recharge area). An area of the earth's surface where water infiltrated the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
Pollution susceptibility. The relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility map(s). Maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas. Areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.
