Editor's note— Ord. No. 2021-03 , § 1, adopted April 5, 2021, repealed the former Ch. 5, §§ 8-5-1—8-5-12, 8-5-21—8-5-23, 8-5-31—8-5-35, and enacted a new Ch. 5 as set out herein. The former chapter pertained to trees and shrubs and derived from Ord. of 8/1/94; Ord. of 6/1/98; and Ord. of 8/21/01.

Sec. 8-5-1 - Purpose.
new
The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the installation of trees and landscaping as part of the land development process in order to enhance the quality of life within the City. The reasons for requiring trees on a site and in parking lots are to provide shade, reduce temperatures, reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce air and water pollution.
The following regulations seek to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to achieve a healthy, beautiful, and safe community and to enhance the City's environmental and visual character for its citizens' use and enjoyment by the following means:
(1)
Improve environmental quality by recognizing the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment such as improving air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; reducing and reversing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation.
(2)
Maintain and increase the value of land by requiring landscaping to be incorporated into development, thus becoming by itself a valuable capital asset.
(3)
Provide direct and important physical and psychological benefits to human beings through the use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare, and to break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspects of urban development.
(4)
Preserve existing natural vegetation where possible and incorporate native plants, plant communities, and ecosystems into landscape design.
