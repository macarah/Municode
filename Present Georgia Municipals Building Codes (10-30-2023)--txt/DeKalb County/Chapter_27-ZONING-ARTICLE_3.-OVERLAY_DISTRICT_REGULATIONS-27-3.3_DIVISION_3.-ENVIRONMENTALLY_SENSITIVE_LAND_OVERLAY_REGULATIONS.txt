27-3.3 DIVISION 3. - ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE LAND OVERLAY REGULATIONS

Sec. 3.3.1. - Environmentally sensitive lands; purpose and intent.
The board of commissioners finds that there are land areas within the county within which regulations supplemental to those regulations imposed by the underlying zoning district should be imposed in order to preserve or protect environmental elements unique to said land area. The intent and purpose of the board of commissioners in establishing such environmentally sensitive land overlay regulations is as follows:
A.
To reduce hazards to life and protect structures and uses from damage which may be caused by construction on or use of land which is unsafe or unsuitable for development;
B.
To protect land, public infrastructure and waters of the county from damages caused by improper use or construction on land which has physical, environmental or aesthetic limitations for development;
C.
To maintain and enhance natural land features which are environmentally significant or which constitute a natural resource of importance to the county at large, including especially Arabia Mountain and the valleys, ridges and areas of significant views surrounding said mountain;
D.
To maintain and protect significant and important archaeological resources of the county;
E.
To enhance public access to and enjoyment of the county's streams, creeks, and all other watercourses;
F.
To implement the policies of the comprehensive plan related to the protection and enjoyment of natural resources; and
G.
To identify specific resources so as to enable property owners to execute conservation easements and secure tax and other advantages therefrom.

Sec. 3.3.2. - Creation of overlay zoning districts for environmentally sensitive lands.
To carry out the purposes and provisions of this chapter, Environmentally Sensitive Land Overlay Districts are hereby authorized to be established.

To protect viewsheds through the imposition of reasonable height and development standards for buildings and structures within such viewsheds;
D.
To encourage and facilitate private or public conservation easements so as to promote the purposes and intent of the district;
