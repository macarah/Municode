Sec. 10A. - Independent internal audit.
modified
(a)
(1)
It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the DeKalb County government that public officials, government managers, and private citizens know not only whether government funds are handled properly and in compliance with laws and regulations but also whether public programs are achieving the purposes for which they were authorized and funded, and whether they are doing so efficiently, effectively, and equitably. An independent internal audit function can provide objective information on the operations of government programs, assist managers in carrying out their responsibilities, and help ensure full transparency and accountability to the public. Internal auditing is defined as an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.
(2)
The public interest requires that the general assembly provide for the proper administration and operation of the DeKalb County government by establish-ing by law an independent internal audit function to assist the governing authority to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.
(b)
The office of internal audit is hereby established which shall consist of the chief audit executive ("auditor") and those assistants, employees, and personnel as deemed necessary by such auditor for the efficient and effective administration of the affairs of the office, and over whom the auditor shall have the sole authority to appoint, employ, and remove.

In the event that the commission fails to appoint a nominee within thirty (30) days, the auditor shall be appointed by a majority vote of the audit oversight committee.
(d)
The term of office of the auditor shall be five (5) years and until his or her successor is qualified and appointed. The auditor shall be limited to a maximum of two (2) terms in office. A vacancy in the position of auditor shall exist by reason of expiration of term, resignation, death, removal from office by the vote of a supermajority of the members of the commission, or if the auditor becomes ineligible to hold civil office within the meaning of O.C.G.A. § 45-2-1 and that ineligibility is established by decision of a court of competent jurisdiction which declares the office vacant because of such ineligibility. A vacancy shall be filled within sixty (60) days by a majority vote of the audit oversight committee for the remainder of the term of office.
(e)
The auditor must have adequate professional proficiency for the job and shall:
(1)
Be a certified public accountant or a certified internal auditor;

(4)
The desired results or benefits are being achieved;

(6)
Management has established adequate operating and administrative procedures and practices, systems or accounting internal control systems, and internal management controls; and

In addition, they shall provide access for the auditor to inspect all property, equipment, and facilities within their custody.

The auditor shall coordinate and monitor auditing performed by certified public accounting firms or other organizations employed under contract by the governing authority to assist with audit related activities. Contracting for the external audit will follow the normal contracting processes of the governing authority of DeKalb County except for the participation and oversight by the audit oversight committee and auditor.

(k)
If, during an audit, the auditor becomes aware of abuse or illegal acts or indications of such acts that could affect the governmental entity, the auditor shall report the irregularities to the audit oversight committee, the chief executive, and the commission.
