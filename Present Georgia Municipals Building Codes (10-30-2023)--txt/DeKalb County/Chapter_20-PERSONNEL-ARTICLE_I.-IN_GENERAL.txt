Engage in any business or transaction or have a financial interest or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties or which would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties;

Engage in or accept private employment or render services for a private interest when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of official county duties or would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties;
(3)
Disclose confidential information concerning the property, governmental body or affairs of the county without proper legal authorization, or use such information to advance the employee's financial or other private interests or that of others;
(4)
Participate in the negotiation or the making of any contract with any business or entity in which the employee has a financial interest.

(10)
Accept a gift in violation of any local, state or federal statute.
(11)
Accept vendor promotional training contrary to applicable regulations, policies or guidance relating to the procurement of supplies and services for the county.

(c)

(f)
Employees shall not knowingly solicit or make solicited sales to other employees who are junior in classification or position, or to the family members of such employees, within or without work hours. In the absence of coercion or intimidation, this does not prohibit the sale or lease of an employee's noncommercial personal or real property or commercial sales solicited and made in a retail establishment during non-working hours. This prohibition includes, without limitation, the solicited sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics, household supplies, vitamins, and other goods or services. Both the act of soliciting and the act of selling as a result of soliciting are prohibited. In both cases, however, a solicitation is necessary for a violation to occur. While the standard prohibits a superior from making a solicited sale to a subordinate or to the subordinate's family, sales made because a subordinate approaches the superior and requests the sale to be made are not prohibited, absent coercion or intimidation by the superior. The posting of an advertisement in accordance with county policies does not constitute solicitation for purposes of this subsection.

(h)
An employee shall be disqualified for two (2) years from participating in any particular matter in which a former employer is a party or represents a party. The two-year period of disqualification begins to run on the date the employee left the employ of the former employer.
(i)
An employee may accept unsolicited gifts from a person or entity other than a prohibited source, having an aggregate market value of forty dollars ($40.00) or less per source per occasion, provided that the aggregate market value of individual gifts received from any one source under the authority of this paragraph shall not exceed one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00) in a calendar year.
(j)
Definitions.
(1)
Covered relationship. An employee has a covered relationship with:
a.
A person with whom the employee has or seeks a business, contractual or other financial relationship that involves other than a routine consumer transaction;
b.
A person who is a member of the employee's household, or who is within the third degree of relationship with of the employee;
c.
A person for whom the employee's spouse, parent or child is serving or seeking to serve as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor or employee;
d.
Any person for whom the employee has, within the last year, served as officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor or employee; or
e.
An organization, other than a political party, in which the employee is an active participant.
(2)
Direct and predictable effect means a particular matter will have a direct effect if there is a close causal link between any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any effect on a financial interest. An effect may be direct even though it does not occur immediately. A particular matter will not have a direct effect on a financial interest, however, if the chain of causation is contingent upon the occurrence of events that are speculative or that are independent of, and unrelated to, the matter. A particular matter will have a predictable effect if there is a real, as opposed to a speculative, possibility that the matter will affect a financial interest. It is not necessary, however, that the magnitude of the gain or loss be known, and the dollar amount of the gain or loss is immaterial.
(3)
Former employer includes any person or entity which the employee served as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor or employee.
(4)
Gift includes any gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, trip, hospitality, loan, forbearance, or other item having monetary value. It includes services as well as gifts of training, transportation, local travel, lodgings and meals, whether provided in-kind, by purchase of a ticket, payment in advance, or reimbursement after the expense has been incurred. A gift does not include:
a.
Modest items of prepared food and refreshments, such as soft drinks, or coffee and donuts, offered other than as part of a meal;
b.
Greeting cards and items with little intrinsic value, such as plaques, certificates, and trophies, which are intended solely for presentation;
c.
Loans from banks and other financial institutions on terms generally available to the public;
d.
Social invitations from persons or entities, other than prohibited sources. An employee may accept food, refreshments and entertainment, not including travel or lodgings, at a social event attended by several persons where the invitation is from a person or entity that is not a prohibited source and no fee is charged to any person in attendance.
(5)
Imputed interests means the financial interests of the following persons will serve to disqualify an employee to the same extent as if they were the employee's own interests:
a.
The employee's spouse/domestic partner;
b.
The employee's child;
c.
An organization or entity which the employee or his/her spouse serves as officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee; and
d.
A person with whom the employee is negotiating for or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment.
(6)
Market value means the retail cost the employee would incur to purchase the gift. An employee who cannot ascertain the market value of a gift may estimate its market value by reference to the retail cost of similar items of like quality. The market value of a gift of a ticket entitling the holder to food, refreshments, entertainment, or any other benefit shall be the face value of the ticket.
(7)
Particular matter encompasses only matters that involve deliberation, decision, or action that is focused upon the interests of specific persons, or a discrete and identifiable class of persons. The particular matters covered by this subpart include, but are not limited to, a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation or arrest.
(8)
Personal and substantial means the direct and active supervision of the participation of a subordinate in the matter. To participate substantially means that the employee's involvement is of significance to the matter. Participation may be substantial even though it is not determinative of the outcome of the particular matter. However, it requires more than official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on administrative or peripheral issues. A finding of substantiality should be based not only on the effort devoted to a matter, but also on the importance of the effort.
(9)
Prohibited source means any person or entity who:
a.
Is seeking official action by the employee or the employee's department;
b.
Does business or seeks to do business with the county or the employee's department;

d.
Has interests that may be substantially affected by performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties; or
e.
Is an organization having a majority of its members as described in paragraphs (j)(9)a. through d. of this section.
(10)
A gift is solicited or accepted because of the employee's official position if it is from a person other than an employee and would not have been solicited, offered, or given had the employee not held the status, authority or duties associated with his/her county position. A gift which is solicited or accepted indirectly includes a gift:
a.
Given with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence to his/her parent, sibling, spouse, child (included adopted and step-children), or dependent relative because of that person's relationship to the employee, or
b.
Given to any other person, including any charitable organization, on the basis of designation, recommendation, or other specification by the employee.
(11)
Third degree of relationship. The following persons are relatives within the third degree of relationship: great-grandparent, grandparent, parent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, child, grandchild, great-grandchild, nephew or niece.

Sec. 20-21. - Disposition of special fees and rewards.
Special fees and rewards received by any employee by reason of the performance of any act required of such employee by the county and such employee's duties, whether paid by an individual or by a public authority, shall be deemed the property of the county and no employee shall accept for private use and benefit this fee or reward.
(Code 1976, § 2-3011)
Sec. 20-22. - Full-time service; outside employment.
The county shall be entitled to the full-time services of all employees whose positions are on a full-time basis. All outside employment must be approved in advance by the department head. No outside employment which interferes with the employee's scheduled county work time shall be allowed, nor shall any outside employment be allowed which may create a conflict, or apparent conflict, between private interest of the individual and official county duties and responsibilities.

Sec. 20-23. - Physical examination.
Before entering employment and as often as the head of the department may deem necessary for the performance of work assigned, an applicant or employee shall undergo a physical examination by a licensed physician to determine the physical fitness of the employee for the job sought or duty assigned. Such examination shall be conducted by the county physician or the county physician's designee and paid for by the county. The standard of physical fitness requirements related to job duty shall be established by each department head with due consideration given to the duties to be performed. Before becoming effective, such physical standards shall be submitted to and approved by the director and shall be furnished to the physician conducting the physical examination. No otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall be excluded from county employment solely by reason of handicap, unless such handicap prohibits such individual from performing job-related duties or places such handicapped person or county employee in unsafe conditions likely to result in bodily injuries to the handicapped person or other county employee. If a county employee does not agree to submit to a physical examination, such refusal shall be grounds for dismissal, suspension or leave without pay.
