27-2.17 DIVISION 17. - HR-3 (HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL-3) DISTRICT

Sec. 2.17.1. - Statement of purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of the board of commissioners in establishing the HR-3 (High Density Residential-3) District regulations is as follows:
A.
To encourage primarily residential, urban-scaled developments that allow accessory retail, office, institutional, and civic uses;
B.
To provide for high density, high-rise residential neighborhoods with a mix of single-family and multi-family housing types that maintain harmony of scale, intensity, and design with surrounding development;
C.
To provide for connectivity of streets and communities and reduce the dependence on automobile use by increasing the ease of movement and opportunities for alternative modes of travel;
D.
To implement the future development map of the county's most current comprehensive plan.

Sec. 2.17.2. - Permitted and special land uses.
Permitted uses and uses requiring special land use permits shall be as provided in Table 4.1. In cases where a use is permitted but there exist supplemental use regulations for that use specified in article 4, such regulations shall also apply.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 2.17.3. - Dimensional requirements.
Dimensional requirements for the HR-3 (High Density Residential-3) District shall be as provided in Table 2.4, "Medium and High Density Residential Zoning Districts Dimensional Requirements."
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)

( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 2.17.5. - Density and location criteria.
A.
Use of bonuses shall permit a development to exceed the maximum base density established for the district in which the development property is located, provided that in no case shall a development exceed the maximum density allowed by the character area in which the property is located, according to the future development map adopted at the time of land disturbance permit application. Table 2.14 describes the maximum allowed dwelling unit density after application of any bonuses.

Density determination of each HR-3 (High Density Residential-3) property:
1.
Existing HR-3 properties: For existing properties converted to HR-3 (High Density Residential-3) District classification at the effective date of this chapter:
a.
Where conditions of zoning regulating density have been attached to the property, maximum density shall remain as established.
b.
Where no conditions of zoning regulating density have been attached to the property, maximum density shall be the "Base Max" described in Table 2.14, unless administratively reviewed and approved for bonus increases according to the criteria set forth in subsection C. below.
2.
New HR-3 properties: For property rezoned to the HR-3 (High Density Residential-3) District classification after the effective date of this chapter, density shall be established by the board of commissioners at the time of approval, based upon the criteria set forth in subsection C. below.
C.
Density bonus eligibility and calculations. Density bonuses are intended for subdivisions as defined in this chapter, not for individual infill lots. The maximum allowed density on HR-3 (High Density Residential-3) District zoned property may be increased above the "base max" by application of density bonuses as indicated by Table 2.6, and may be accumulated if eligible. An example of how allowable density bonuses are calculated is shown in the example at the end of Table 2.6. In no case shall density exceed the bonus maximum established by Table 2.14.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 2.17.6. - Building heights.
Maximum building heights shall meet character area intent by compliance with the transitional height and buffer standards of article 5 as well as proportional relationship of density to height as regulated by Table 2.15.
