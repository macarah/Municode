ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 21-1. - Purpose and findings.
The board of commissioners further finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the county can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the county's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The county, further, finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the county. The county finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of DeKalb County in enacting this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of DeKalb County, and to implement the policies and objectives of a comprehensive development plan of the county through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in DeKalb County;
(2)
To regulate the erection and placement of signs within DeKalb County in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians;
(3)
To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed;
(4)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive county in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts;
(5)
To maintain for the county's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the county;
(6)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the county;
(7)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of business which are located within DeKalb County, and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods or services so as to promote the economic vitality of businesses that are located within the county;
(8)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State and United States Constitutions with DeKalb County;
(9)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts;
(10)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits;
(11)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
(12)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs; and
(13)
To prohibit all signs not expressly authorized by this chapter, to provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

Exceptional conditions pertaining to the property where the sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape, or topography, which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area;
