ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 18-1. - Purpose and findings.
The governing authority of the DeKalb County finds that nuisances are such activities and conditions that cause a demonstrable adverse impact on the community. These activities and conditions may be associated with illegal criminal activity that has also been proven to have a demonstrable adverse impact on community residences and results in neighborhood blight. The county finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of DeKalb County in enacting this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To state that it is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the unincorporated jurisdiction of this county to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the jurisdiction, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinance;
(2)
To preserve the value of property and prevent neighborhood blight that arises from poorly maintained property;
(3)
To maintain and promote an attractive residential area and commercial area by requiring that dilapidated property be repaired or removed;
(4)
To maintain for the county's residents, workers and visitors an aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the county;
(5)
To protect the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of DeKalb County by the removal of both criminal perpetrators and the housing blight on the community;
(6)
To require owners of real property to keep their property in compliance with building, safety and fire codes to minimize the occurrence of illegal criminal activity therein;
(7)
To promote the safety of its citizens, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public areas, to attract tourists, settlers and industry, to serve the public health, safety and aesthetics, to advance the general prosperity of the community and to serve the general welfare; and
(8)
To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, the order of abatement shall require the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, shall require the taking of reasonable measures designed to prevent the recurrence of the nuisance activity described in subsection (a) in light of the magnitude of the harm caused by the nuisance. Those measures may include, but are not limited to, making improvements to real estate and installing lighting to enhance security, the hiring of licensed and insured security personnel, the hiring of a receiver, the initiation and execution of eviction proceedings against tenants engaged in illegal activity; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
(3)
The court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided by Georgia law, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the county.
(g)
The court may authorize the issuance of ex parte administrative search warrants reasonably calculated to determine whether the nuisance has been abated or whether the order of the court has been obeyed.
(h)
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with illegal activities or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(i)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid.
(1)
DeKalb County, the public officer and the board of commissioners are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and
(2)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(j)
The lien provided for in subsection (i)(2), above, shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g), as amended. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Tit. 48, Ch. 4 ; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the board of commissioners. Thirty (30) days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(k)
The board of commissioners may waive and release any lien imposed on property pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section if the owner of such property enters into a contract with DeKalb County agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property; demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation; fully completes the rehabilitation; and fulfills all terms of the contract.
(l)
The board of commissioners may appropriate revenue as necessary and may accept and apply grants or donations in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.
(m)
Where the abatement action does not commence in the Superior Court of DeKalb County, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the Superior Court of DeKalb County under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29, as may hereinafter be amended. Notice of an appeal shall act as a supersedeas.

(5)
To promote and protect the public health and safety through the control of weeds and grass which constitute a fire hazard and a public nuisance;

(a)
The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure registry as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure.

(c)
This foreclosure registry will require creditors to provide the county with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed real property into compliance with applicable provisions of state and federal law, and the Code.
