ARTICLE VIII. - ATTENDANCE AND LEAVE

Sec. 20-161. - Hours of work.
(a)
The standard workweek for full-time employees shall generally be forty (40) hours; however, due to the requirements of certain positions, this standard may vary. Specific hours of work shall be set by each department head with the concurrence of the director and the approval of the chief executive. In any event, specific hours of work and compensation for overtime shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Time worked in excess of the standard workweek, which is approved by the department head in advance or in cases of emergency as determined by the department head, shall be credited as overtime. In computing hours worked for overtime purposes, annual and sick leave and holidays shall be excluded. Overtime shall be accrued or compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1½) times the regular rate. Compensatory time at the rate of one and one-half (1½) hours for every hour worked in excess of the applicable standard workweek may be given to employees eligible for overtime compensation in lieu of cash compensation.
(b)
Eligible law enforcement, emergency medical, fire and seasonal employees may accrue up to four hundred eighty (480) hours of compensatory time before overtime compensation must be paid in cash. All other employees eligible for overtime compensation may accrue up to two hundred forty (240) hours. Compensatory time may be utilized by the employee with prior approval of the department head under the same procedures as apply to annual leave as set forth in section 20-165, subsection (e). For employees eligible for overtime compensation, accrued balances must be paid to the employee at termination at a rate not less than the average regular rate of pay over the last three (3) years of employment or the final rate of pay, whichever is higher.
(c)
Employees exempt from overtime compensation may be granted compensatory time at an hour-for-hour rate at the discretion of the department head. If granted, such compensatory time must be used within one (1) calendar year of the date granted in accordance with procedures as apply to annual leave as set forth in section 20-165, subsection (e). Overtime exempt employees are not eligible to receive cash compensation for unused balances.
(Code 1976, § 2-3121)
Sec. 20-162. - Transfer of leave benefits.
When a permanent or working test employee is transferred to another department, the department receiving the employee shall assume responsibility for this employee's unused accumulated sick and annual leave.
(Code 1976, § 2-3130)
Sec. 20-163. - Sick leave.
(a)
County employees, except temporary and emergency employees, are eligible for sick leave benefits as earned from the date of employment. Sick leave shall accrue for full-time employees at the rate of one (1) day per month or its proportional equivalent (see section 20-165 for annual leave accrual rate) and an additional one-half day's sick leave or proportional equivalent thereof (see section 20-165 for annual accrual rate) will accrue on June 30 and December 31 of each year. Part-time employees shall accrue sick leave at the rate of one-half day a month and an additional one-quarter day's leave will accrue on June 30 and December 31 of each year. An employee who starts work before the sixteenth of a month shall earn sick leave for that month, but if the employee starts work on or later than the sixteenth of the month, sick leave accrual will be determined by the hours worked by the end of the month. No sick leave shall accrue for an employee under conditions as set forth in section 20-165, subsection (b). No accrual shall be permitted for an employee on leave without pay, workers' compensation or disability leave. When an employee shall have accumulated thirty (30) days of sick leave by the end of the last pay period in November, such employee may be paid in cash each year by December 25 for one-fourth of that year's unused sick leave accumulated beyond the thirty (30) days, and the other three-fourths beyond the thirty (30) days shall be added to the sick leave accumulation of such employee. Accrued but unused sick leave shall be cumulative for succeeding years.
(b)
Both probationary and permanent status employees who are eligible for sick leave with pay shall be granted this leave for the following reasons:
(1)
Personal illness or physical incapacity and doctor or dentist appointments of the employee, employee's spouse, children living in the same household, or serious illness of spouse, children or parents as defined in the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
(2)
Enforced quarantine of the employee in accordance with community health regulations.
(c)
An employee on sick leave shall inform the employee's immediate supervisor of the fact and the reason therefor within the time established by the department head, and failure to do so may be cause for denial of sick leave with pay for the period of the absence.
(d)
A medical certificate signed by a licensed physician may be required by the department head to substantiate a request for sick leave for any of the following:
(1)
Any period of absence consisting of three (3) or more consecutive days.
(2)
Sick leave of any duration if absence from duty recurs frequently or habitually, provided the employee has been notified in writing that a certificate will be required.
(3)
To support the use of family and medical leave and unscheduled annual leave when sick leave has been exhausted.

Annual leave accumulated over the maximum amount that may be carried over to the next year shall be converted to sick leave and added to the employee's accumulated sick leave balance for the next year.
(d)
[Scheduling leave.] Annual leave shall be scheduled in advance and requires the approval of the department head; vacation schedules shall be arranged to provide the least possible disruption of department work programs. Annual leave can be used for emergency situations when approved by the department head. Annual leave, to the extent the purpose for such leave qualifies for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), will be counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.
(e)
[Unused sick leave.] At the beginning of each year, an employee shall be credited with one (1) day of annual leave for each fifty (50) days of unused accrued sick leave the employee had on December 31 of the previous year.
(f)
Transition to new annual maximum carryover. To move employees from the 2011 carryover limits to the new 2012 carryover limits, the rollover process will be handled in two (2) steps as follows. First, any amount of accumulated annual leave that exceeds the prior sixty-day maximum at the end of 2011 shall be converted to sick leave, per previous procedures. Second, any remaining annual leave exceeding the new 2012 carryover limit shall be converted to sick leave unless the employee elected to place it into an annual leave reserve account. That election must be made in writing by the employee and received by the director no later than January 2, 2012. If an employee does not make a timely election, all of the employee's accumulated annual leave not carried over into 2012 shall be converted to sick leave. All accumulated annual leave that is converted into sick leave pursuant to this subparagraph shall be converted on an hour-for-hour basis and added to the employee's accumulated sick leave balance for 2012. Accumulated annual leave that is placed into an annual leave reserve account may be used as annual leave if the employee's accumulated annual leave is otherwise exhausted and the employee's department head authorizes such use.
(g)
Annual leave payout for employees who have reserve account annual leave at separation.
