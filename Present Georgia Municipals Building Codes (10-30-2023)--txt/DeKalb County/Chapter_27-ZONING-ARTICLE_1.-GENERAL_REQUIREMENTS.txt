Zoning conditions.
a.
Any project that was approved prior to the effective date of this chapter may be developed according to the provisions of the previously approved development, program, or plan.

b.
If an owner or applicant desires to have the standards and requirements of this chapter to apply instead of standards and requirements established by previously approved zoning conditions, the owner or applicant must apply for a zoning condition amendment, as provided in article 7.
c.
Notwithstanding subparagraphs A. and B. above, when no land disturbance or building permit has been issued on property located in an overlay district and on which a zoning condition was previously approved, and if the previously approved zoning condition is in conflict with the overlay district regulations, the overlay district regulations shall supersede the previously approved zoning condition.

Sec. 1.1.12. - Relation to and conflict with other provisions.
The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted and applied so as to constitute the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. Whenever any provision of this chapter imposes a greater requirement or a higher standard than is required by any federal or state law or other county ordinance, resolution or regulation, the provision of this chapter shall govern unless preempted by said federal or state law. Whenever any provision of any federal or state law or other county ordinance, resolution or regulation imposes a greater requirement or a higher standard than is required by this chapter, the provision of such state or federal statute or other county ordinance or regulation shall apply. Whenever any conflict arises between this chapter and chapter 14 of the Code of DeKalb County, as Revised 1988, the provisions of this zoning ordinance shall prevail, with the exception of chapter 14, article 2, environmental control. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be interpreted to obviate the requirements for compliance with any and all other provisions of federal or state law, or the Code, including but not limited to the requirements for licenses or permits of any kind.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 1.1.13. - Relation to private agreements.
This chapter is not intended to abrogate, annul or otherwise interfere with any easement, covenant or other private agreement or legal relationship, provided that when the regulations of this chapter are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements or legal relationships, the regulations of this chapter shall govern. Private restrictive covenants to which the county is not a party shall not be regulated or enforced by the county under this chapter.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 1.1.14. - Zoning maps.
The county shall be divided into the zoning districts identified in articles 2 and 3 of this chapter, as depicted on the official zoning maps entitled "Zoning Maps, DeKalb County, Georgia" (the "official zoning maps"). The official zoning maps, to be adopted contemporaneously with this chapter, together with all explanatory information contained or referenced thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
The official zoning maps shall be adopted contemporaneously with this chapter in digital format and contained on a compact disk to be maintained in its original, unedited and unaltered form by the clerk to the board of commissioners. A printed copy of the compact disk's contents depicting the official zoning maps on the date of its initial adoption shall also be maintained in its original, unedited and unaltered form by the clerk to the board of commissioners.
Any subsequent amendments made by the board of commissioners to the official zoning maps after the initial date of adoption with this chapter shall be indicated on the digital version of the official zoning maps by the director of planning. The director of the GIS department shall continuously maintain the digital version of the official zoning maps so that they accurately show all amendments made thereto by the board of commissioners since the initial date of adoption, indicating the dates of said amendments. A copy of the updated and current version of the official zoning maps in digital format, showing all amendments thereto since the date of initial adoption, shall be held in custody of the director of planning.
Any condition(s) of zoning related to any property, either existing at the time of initial adoption or subsequently imposed by the board of commissioners shall be on the official zoning maps, with reference to the applicable zoning case number. The clerk to the board of commissioners shall maintain custody of the minutes applicable to the referenced zoning case numbers, which state the zoning conditions. Uncertified copies of the official zoning maps may be provided to the public for informational purposes only.
Verifications of the current zoning status of property shall be the responsibility of the director of planning. To verify the current zoning status of a particular parcel, an individual may obtain a certified copy of the official zoning maps, or a portion thereof, from the director of planning. Certified copies of the official zoning maps, or portions thereof, shall be certified by the director of planning with his signature and the date on which the portions were certified. The director of planning shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of all land, buildings and structures located in the county, except for: (1) amendments enacted by the board of commissioners but not yet depicted on the official zoning maps, and (2) uncertainties to be clarified by the board of commissioners as described in section 1.1.15. Any inaccuracy on the official zoning maps that is reasonably determined to be a scrivener's error may be corrected by the planning director.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 1.1.15. - Interpretation of zoning maps.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
A.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow centerlines of rights-of-way or prescriptive easements. In case of closure of a street or alley, or vacation of any easement, the boundary shall be construed as remaining at its prior location unless ownership of the closure or vacated area is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving to correspond with the ownership, but not beyond any previous right-of-way or easement line.
B.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.
C.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following county limit lines shall be construed as following such county limits.
D.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway in the right-of-way.
E.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following shorelines of bodies of water shall be construed to follow such shorelines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of creeks, streams, rivers, or other predominantly linear bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
F.
Boundaries indicated as parallel to or concentric with, or extensions of features indicated in paragraphs A. through E. above, shall be so construed. Distances and dimensions not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined from the official zoning map by the director of planning.
G.
Where areas appear to be unclassified on the official zoning map, and classification cannot be established by the above rules, such areas shall be considered to be classified Residential Estate (RE) until action is taken by the board of commissioners to amend the official zoning map.
H.
Where territory is added to the jurisdictional area, it shall be considered to be classified Residential Estate (RE) until action is taken by the board of commissioners to amend the official zoning map.
I.
Where uncertainties continue to exist or further interpretation is required beyond that provided for in the above paragraphs, the question shall be presented by the director of planning to the board of commissioners to enact a clarifying resolution and said action shall be recorded on the official zoning map as is provided herein.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 1.1.16. - Rules applicable to parcels split into two or more zoning districts.
Where a parcel of land is split into two (2) or more zoning districts, each such portion of said parcel may only be used for purposes allowed within the zoning district to which each respective portion is classified. No principal or accessory use of land, buildings or structures, and no use or building or structure authorized by special administrative permit, special land use permit, or special exception, shall be authorized unless said use or building or structure is authorized or permitted within the applicable zoning district.
Where a parcel of land contains two (2) or more zoning classifications, the official zoning maps shall depict said parcel with a Multiple Zone ("MZ") designation. To verify the zoning status of respective portion(s) of a parcel containing multiple zoning classifications, an individual may obtain verification from the director of planning.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 1.1.17. - Severability.
The several provisions of this chapter shall be separable in accordance with the following rules:

Should any court of competent jurisdiction adjudge any section or provision of this chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect the validity or continued application of this chapter as a whole or any section or provision thereof other than the section(s) or provision(s) specifically adjudged invalid.
B.
Should any court of competent jurisdiction adjudge invalid the application of any section or provision of this chapter to a particular property, building or structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said section or provision to any other property, building or structure.
