This article establishes public policies for the protection of the natural environment and specifies standards for land development to ensure achievement of these public policies.
(b)
By declaration of public policies for environmental protection, the board of commissioners expresses its intent to protect the public interest by seeking to assure, where appropriate, maintenance of the natural environment, prevention of its degradation and assuring high quality land development. The board further declares its intent that these policies shall constitute the public policy framework within which a comprehensive program for protection of the natural environment and implementation of a comprehensive drainage improvement program shall be accomplished.
(c)
The development process, as established by this chapter 14, is guided by the policies and provisions contained in the comprehensive plan of the county.
(d)
In implementing this article, the county shall use and require compliance with all relevant design standards, calculations, formulas, methods, and other guidance from the GSMM as well as all related appendices.
(e)
This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other article, ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, including but not limited to any applicable stream buffers under state and local laws, and the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for dam safety. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision in the county's MS4 permit and this article, the provision from the MS4 permit shall control. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this article and the GSMM, the provision from this article shall control. In the event of any other conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this article and any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, the provision that is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
(f)
If any provision of this article is invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of this article.
(Ord. No. 85-00, Pt. I, 12-28-00; Ord. of 2-8-2022 , Pt. I)
Sec. 14-28. - Purposes.
modified
(a)
It is the purpose of this article to establish public policies to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, natural environment and general welfare and to establish requirements, standards and procedures for land development. The public policy objective of protecting the natural environment is to be achieved by:
(1)
Regulating the alteration of land and topography.
(2)
Regulating the removal and requiring the replacement of certain vegetation.
(3)
Requiring erosion control and sedimentation control.
(4)
Protecting county streams and floodplains from substantial alteration of their natural functions and from sediment and debris accumulation.
(5)
Specifying standards for drainage system design.
(6)
Assuring the continuous and efficient operation of the drainage system.
(7)
Protecting the water quality within intermittent and perennial streams throughout the county.
(8)
Establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-construction stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. Proper management of post-construction stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. Additionally, the county is required to comply with several state and federal laws, regulations, and permits and the requirements of the Metropolitan North Georgia water planning district's regional water plan related to managing the water quantity, velocity, and quantity of post-construction stormwater runoff.
(b)
It is the board of commissioners' intent that land development be accomplished in conformity with the public policy statements. To that end, the plans required under applicable provisions of this article shall be reviewed by the county to enable a full exchange of information between the county and the applicant as to the county's public policies for land development. However, these policies shall not be used as a control or regulatory mechanism nor be construed as land development standards enforceable under applicable provisions of this article.
(c)
The board further declares its intent that these public policies be evaluated periodically so as to reflect the community's interests in protection of the natural environment and to give direction to county actions in matters affecting the natural environment and land development.
(Ord. No. 85-00, Pt. I, 12-28-00; Ord. of 2-8-2022 , § Pt. I)

Such applications will be subject to the provisions of chapter 14 in effect prior to the effective date of this article II.
(c)
Before filing a land development permit application on a project for review and approval, the applicant shall request a pre-submittal meeting and meet with the applicable department(s) of the county to discuss the procedure for approval of a land development permit and the requirements as to the general layout of streets, parking, open space/lot coverage, street improvements, drainage, sewage, fire protection and similar matters, as well as the availability of existing services, including schools. The purpose of the pre-submittal meeting is also to discuss opportunities, constraints, and ideas for the stormwater management system before formal site design engineering. To the extent applicable, local and regional watershed plans, greenspace plans, trails and greenway plans, and other resource protection plans should be consulted in the pre-submittal meeting. The pre-submittal meeting should take place based on an early step in the development process such as before site analysis and inventory or the stormwater concept plan. The applicable department(s) and the applicant shall review the applicant's stormwater management plans, inspection and maintenance requirements and water quality control requirements. This meeting will also allow county officials to discuss with the applicant the necessary regulations that will properly accomplish the project. Applicants must request a pre-submittal meeting with the applicable department(s) of the county when applying for a determination of infeasibility through the practicability policy.
(d)
For purposes of this section, a valid and complete application for a land disturbance permit shall consist of the following:
(1)
Six (6) copies of complete civil plans, that include a site plan, a grading and drainage plan, a utility plan, a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, a landscape plan, and a tree survey;

(Ord. No. 85-00, Pt. I, 12-28-00)
Sec. 14-34. - Issuance of notice of violation; variances; specification of time period for correction; appeals.
modified
(a)
Notice of violation. Whenever the director determines that development activity or inactivity on a property does not comply with the approved development and construction plans, that approved and required erosion and sedimentation control facilities or devices have been altered, damaged or destroyed, or that any other activities violate the provisions of this article, the director shall issue a notice of violation. Whenever the director determines that the drainage system has been unlawfully altered, causing inadequate drainage, the director shall issue a notice of violation. The provisions of this section 14-34(a) shall be in addition to any other penalty provisions applicable to this article. The notice of violation of the provisions of this article or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto shall be addressed to the owner of the property or the owner's agent and to the person, tenant, firm, corporation, property owner or property owner's agent found to be violating the provisions of this article and shall:
(1)
Be in writing;
(2)
Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where the violation has occurred;
(3)
List the specific provisions of this article which have been violated;
(4)
State that, if these repairs, construction or alterations are not completed within a reasonable time period specified by the inspector, summons shall be issued for the person, firm, corporation, owner, or owner's agent to appear in court of competent jurisdiction. However, in the judgment of the director, where the violation is willful, in wanton disregard of the provisions of this article or constitutes a public health and safety hazard or endangers the ecosystem, the director may issue a court summons in lieu of a notice of violation.
(b)
Penalty. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to do anything prohibited or fail to do anything required by the provisions of this article, as they now exist or as they may hereafter be amended. Any person, firm or corporation that shall do anything prohibited or fail to do anything required by the provisions of this article, as they now exist or as they may hereafter be amended, upon conviction of a violation in court of competent jurisdiction shall be subject to a fine and/or imprisonment in accordance with section 1-10 of the Code. Where any offense or violation continues from day-to-day, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate offense. The owner of any buildings or premises or parts thereof, where anything in violation of this article exists, and any architect, builder, engineer, contractor, or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits, or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense.
(c)
Variances.
(1)
Except as further limited herein, an applicant may request a variance from the terms of the requirements of sections 14-37, 14-38, 14-40, and 14-42. The director shall have no power to consider or to grant variances which are the responsibility of the director of the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 and other relevant state statutes and regulations. Where variances involving the same project are requested from both the director of the EPD and the director, the director shall take no action on any such request for variance until the director of the EPD grants the variance or otherwise approves the request pending before the EPD. Receiving a variance from the director of the EPD does not obligate the director to permit the project to proceed if the project does not also meet all the other requirements of this article. No variance from the provisions of Chapter 14 shall be authorized except as specifically authorized in this section or specifically authorized in another section of chapter 14.
(2)
Applications for variances authorized in subsection (1) above shall be made in writing to the director and shall contain all of those materials and documents required by the director that are necessary to demonstrate that said request meets the criteria for granting variances.
(3)
In considering a request for a variance to the terms of this article authorized in subsection (1) above, the director shall use all of the following criteria:
(A)
The request, while not strictly meeting the requirements of Chapter 14, will in the judgment of the director be at least as protective of natural resources and the environment as would a plan which met the strict application of these requirements. In making such a judgment, the director shall examine whether the request will be at least as protective of the natural resources and the environment with regard to the following factors:
(i)
Stream bank or soil stabilization;
(ii)
Trapping of sediment in surface runoff;
(iii)
Removal of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides and other pollutants from surface runoff;
(iv)
Terrestrial habitat, food chain, and migration corridor;
(v)
Buffering of flood flows;
(vi)
Infiltration of surface runoff;
(vii)
Noise and visual buffers;
(viii)
Downstream water quality; and
(ix)
Impact on threatened and endangered species, as those species are designated by law or federal or state regulation.
(B)
By reason of exceptional topographic or other relevant physical conditions of the subject property that were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for any development under any design configuration unless a variance is granted.
(C)
The request does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief and does not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties that are similarly situated.
(D)
The grant of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the area in which the property is located.
(E)
The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of Chapter 14 would cause an extreme hardship, provided the hardship was not created by the owner.
(4)
The director's decision shall be in writing, shall state the basis for the decision, and shall be made no more than thirty (30) days following application.
(d)
Appeals.
(1)
Appeals. Appeals shall be made to the zoning board of appeals, as established in Chapter 27 of the Code, and shall be administered in accordance with the notice requirements, criteria and procedural requirements set forth therein, except as otherwise specified below.
(2)
Basis for appeal. Whenever the director approves a variance pursuant to section 14-34(b) and it is alleged that said variance request did not meet the standards of said section, or where the director denies a variance request pursuant to section 14-34(b) and it is alleged that said variance request did meet the standards of said section, or where it is alleged by the applicant that there is error in any final order, requirement, or final decision made by an administrative official based on or made in the interpretation or enforcement of this Chapter 14, the aggrieved person, or any county official, department, board or agency affected by said order, requirement or decision, shall have the right to appeal said final order, requirement or decision to the zoning board of appeals.
(3)
Initiation of appeal. Appeals shall be made by filing with the secretary of the zoning board of appeals an application for appeal specifying the grounds thereof, within thirty (30) days after the action appealed from was taken.
(4)
Appeal stays all legal proceedings. An appeal shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed, that by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in that official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such a case, proceedings shall be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the Superior Court of the county on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
(5)
Time and notice of hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for hearing of the appeal and shall give notice thereof pursuant to the requirements of section 27-917 of the Code of the county as well as due notice to the parties in interest. Any party may appear at the hearing in person, by an agent, or by an attorney and may present oral and/or written documentation, testimony and evidence in accordance with the rules and procedures set by the zoning board of appeals.
(6)
Decision of the zoning board of appeals. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the zoning board of appeals shall make a determination on each appeal. The zoning board of appeals shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time but in no event more than sixty (60) days from the date of the final hearing. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an express finding by the zoning board of appeals that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the zoning board of appeals may reserve or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided all requirements imposed by all other applicable laws are met.
(e)
All appeals of final decisions of the zoning board of appeals under the provisions of this article shall be as follows:
(1)
Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the zoning board of appeals, or any officer, department, board or agency affected by such decision, may seek review of such decision by petitioning the superior court of the county for a writ of certiorari, setting forth plainly the alleged errors. Such petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the final decision of the zoning board of appeals is rendered.
(2)
In any such petition filed, the zoning board of appeals shall be designated the respondent in certiorari and the county shall be designated the defendant in certiorari. The secretary of the zoning board of appeals shall be authorized to acknowledge service of a copy of the petition and writ for the zoning board of appeals as respondent. Service upon the county as defendant shall be as otherwise provided by law. Within the time prescribed by law, the zoning board of appeals shall cause to be filed with the clerk of the county superior court a duly certified record of the proceedings had before the board, including a transcript of the evidence heard before it, if any, and the written decision of the board.
(f)
This article is not intended to abrogate, annul or otherwise interfere with any easement, covenant or other private agreement or legal relationship provided that when the regulations of this article are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements or legal relationships, the regulations of this article shall govern. Further, where there is a conflict between any standard or requirement within Chapter 14, or between the Chapter 14 standards and any other provision of the Code, the more restrictive standard or requirement shall apply.
(Ord. No. 85-00, Pt. I, 12-28-00; Mo. of 1-23-01; Ord. No. 05-17, Pt. I, 11-8-05; Ord. No. 09-05, Pt. I, 2-24-09; Memo. of 9-23-20)

(a)
Policies. It is hereby declared to be public policy to:
(1)
Encourage the design of residential grading plans to provide natural appearance of land contours and to provide ease of use in public areas.
(2)
Minimize the adverse effects of land clearance and grading upon existing vegetation.
(3)
Minimize the adverse effects of land clearance and grading upon the drainage system by strict erosion control and sedimentation control measures.
(4)
Minimize erosion and shear failure potential by encouraging limited cutting and filling.
(b)
Standards.
(1)
All grading operations shall be conducted in compliance with the approved site plans.
(2)
Before beginning construction activity, the intermediate regional floodplain elevation contours shall be identified on the property by staking or other identifying mechanisms no less than every one hundred (100) feet, and shall be identifiable throughout project development.
(3)
Finish grade slopes on residential projects and lots shall not be steeper than three-to-one (3:1), unless absolutely impractical due to vegetation, topography, or soil conditions. Three-to-one (3:1) finish grade slopes shall transition to two-to-one (2:1) slopes at all perpendicular stream crossings.
(4)
Large-scale general grading shall include installation of approved soil and erosion control measures and be limited to phases approved by the director and completed prior to commencing building construction.
(5)
Prohibit grading and filling in floodplains, except for the construction and maintenance of perpendicular crossings of public utilities, drainage conveyances, roadways, sidewalks, and multi-purpose trails constructed in accordance with county design standards and specifications. Any variance from the requirements of this section 14-37(b)(5) shall be in accordance with the requirements of section 14-34 and with the following requirements:
a.
If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the intermediate regional floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the intermediate regional floodplain. Altered sections of the intermediate regional floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt buildup.
b.
Excavation within floodplain areas shall not be permitted unless the excavation can be accomplished in such a manner that the existing low level drainage pattern through the floodplain shall be maintained. The area of compensation within the floodplain shall be considered as ineffective flow area for the purpose of calculating floodplain elevations to meet no-rise certification requirements. The amount of compensation shall be limited to one hundred fifty (150) cubic yards per acre of floodplain area, or proportion thereof based on acreage.

(2)
Minimize the exposure of bare earth to precipitation by encouraging the scheduling of land development in increments of workable size which can be completed within a single construction season or within a time period compatible with the type and size of the project;
(3)
Provide for the reestablishment of vegetation within a reasonable period following completion of final grading and utility installation;
(4)
Give priority to the paving of streets, parking lots and other areas within a reasonable time following completion of final grading; and
(5)
Encourage the use of erosion control and sedimentation techniques found in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia, as published by the state soil and water conservation commission.
(b)
Standards.
(1)
[General requirements.] Any land-disturbing activity permitted under this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended; this chapter; and the permit conditions specified by the director.
(2)
[Minimum requirements.] Nothing contained in state law or this chapter shall prevent the issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements contained in this section or in state law.

Minimum requirement for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
a.
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this section and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities that are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b)(4)b. and c. of this section and any other applicable provision of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, stormwater management facilities, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with the requirements of this section and the NPDES general permit. The development director may require that land disturbance activity be phased. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall address appropriate measures to effectively control soil erosion during successive phases of construction.
b.
Minimum requirements.
1.
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b)(4)b. and c. shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director of the environmental protection division (EPD) or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
2.
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director of the EPD. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres.
3.
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
4.
The director of the EPD may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the BNR, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
c.
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent or minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
1.
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
2.
Cut-fill operations shall be kept to a minimum;
3.
Development plans shall conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
4.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented as provided in sections 14-39 and 14-42;
5.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
6.
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
7.
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
8.
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
9.
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
10.
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
11.
Cuts and fills shall not endanger adjoining property;
12.
Fills shall not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
13.
Grading equipment shall cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
14.
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediment on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(4)b.2.;
15.
Except as provided in paragraph 16. of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot state buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director of the EPD determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director of the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director of the EPD as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
i.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quality to keep shade on the stream bed; and
ii.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines;
16.
There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the BNR, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director of the EPD may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
i.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
ii.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
d.
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit.
(5)
Application/permit process.
a.
General. Before submittal, the property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area and surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator is the only party who may obtain a permit.
b.
Application requirements.
1.
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of county without first obtaining a permit from the development director to perform such activity, and providing a copy of the notice of intent submitted to the EPD, if applicable.
2.
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the development director and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (b)(5)c. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection (b)(4)b. and c. will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by eight (8) copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD rule 391-3-7-.10.
3.
A permitting fee, as determined by the board of commissioners shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area.
4.
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
5.
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the development director. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection (b)(4)c.15. and 16. have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding if required by subsection (b)(5)b.7. have been obtained. Such review will not be required if county and the district enter into an agreement which allows the county to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
6.
If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this chapter, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the development director may deny the permit application.
7.
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
c.
Plan requirements.
1.
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection (b)(4) b. and c., or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.
2.
Data required for the site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted.
d.
Permits.
1.
Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the development director of a completed application, provided variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken.
2.
No permit shall be issued by the development director unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the development director has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsection (b)(4)c.15. and 16. are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(5)b.7. are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
3.
Any land-disturbing activity by the governing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this section, and any other ordinances relating to land development as are applied to private persons, and the director shall enforce such requirements upon the governing authority.
4.
If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
5.
The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the county, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
6.
No permit shall be issued until the applicant files documents with the development director demonstrating compliance with all applicable local, state and federal requirements.
7.
The development director may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more convicted violations of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).
(6)
Inspection and enforcement.
a.
The development director will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the county shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbance activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this section, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person by the development director. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this section.
b.
The development director shall have the power to conduct such investigations as may reasonably be necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this section, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
c.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county, the commission, the district, or the division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
d.
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of the county. The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to the county for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's erosion and sedimentation control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if the county's program is found to be deficient or ineffective.
e.
The division may periodically review the actions of the county which has been certified as a local issuing authority pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of DeKalb County's ordinances and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and DeKalb County. If such review indicates that DeKalb County has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the DeKalb County governing authority in writing. Upon receipt of the notification, the governing authority shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If DeKalb County does not take necessary action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county as a local issuing authority.
f.
The county must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendment to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
(7)
Penalties and incentives.
a.
Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within unincorporated DeKalb County.
b.
Stop work orders. Upon notice from the development director or other county authorized representative, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his/her authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required.
1.
For the first and second violations of the provisions of this section on a site, the director of the EPD or the development director shall issue a written notice of violation to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director of the EPD or the development director shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director of the EPD or development director shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of notice of violation.
2.
For a third and each subsequent violation on a site, the development director shall issue an immediate stop work order, and;
3.
All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
4.
When a violation in the form of land disturbance without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the development director, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the development director. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
c.
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served by the development director upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection (b)(5)b.7. The chief executive officer may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
d.
Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this section, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this section, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the development director issued as provided in this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day, or the maximum amount authorized by section 1-10 of the Code of DeKalb County.

(8)
Education and certification.
a.
Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection of any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.
b.
For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one (1) person who is responsible for erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission, present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site, or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale, permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit.
c.
Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit, but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site, may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this section.
d.
If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4), but shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.
(9)
Administrative appeal, judicial review.

Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the county upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to an appeal before the zoning board of appeals pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in subsection 14-34(d).
b.
Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by administrative appeals from a decision or order of the zoning board of appeals authorized by subsection (b)(9)a. of this section may appeal as provided for by state law.
(10)
Validity and liability.
a.
Validity. If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase, or provision of this section shall be adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, such decisions shall not affect the remaining portions of this section.
b.
Liability.
1.
Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this section nor the compliance with provisions of this section shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the county, the district, its officers or employees for damage to any person or property.
2.
The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit.
3.
No provision of this section shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

Tree preservation and replacement requirements. The following tree preservation and replacement requirements are hereby established:
(1)
If significant trees exist on a tract of land for which a permit subject to this section is sought, either one hundred twenty (120) inches (DBH) per acre or twenty-five (25) percent of existing significant trees per acre of such significant trees, whichever is less, shall be preserved on the site. Except for zoned C-1, C-2, M, or M-2 sites, trees and tree save areas counting toward this requirement shall not be located in required buffer zones. Trees and tree save areas counting toward this requirement on sites zoned C-1, C-2, M or M-2 may be located in stream buffers and state buffer zones, transitional buffer zones and designated floodplains.
If the county arborist determines that special constraints of a site result in an inability to build or develop without removing significant trees on a site, where there are only one hundred twenty (120) inches (DBH) per acre or less of existing significant trees, the arborist may permit the removal of one or more significant trees. Trees removed pursuant to this section must be replaced with trees one (1.0) times the diameter inches of those removed.
(2)
There shall be at least two (2) two-inch (DBH) over story trees in every front yard of properties zoned R-200, R-150, R-30,000, R-20,000, R-100, R-85, and R-75. There shall be at least one (1) two-inch (DBH) over story tree in every front yard of properties zoned R-A5, R-50, R-A8 and RDT.
(3)
The applicant shall landscape the areas with trees and other plant materials in accordance with the following standards:
a.
Residential developments: All residential subdivisions shall have an average density of fifteen (15) density units per acre. Required trees may be located on individual lots or in subdivisions in which there is commonly owned property may be located on such commonly owned property.
b.
Non-residential and multifamily developments: The quantity of total existing/replacement trees on site must be sufficient so as to produce a total site density factor of no less than thirty (30) density units per acre.
c.
With the exception of C-1, C-2, M, or M-2 zoned property, the total tree density units required for a parcel or lot shall be computed based on the area of the parcel or lot, excluding all area within the 100-year floodplain. Total tree density units required for C-1, C-2, M, or M-2 zoned property shall be computed based on the area of the parcel or lot, including all area within the one hundred-year floodplain.

a.
Buffer planting shall meet the minimum width requirements contained in Chapter 27 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances, except as authorized to be reduced by a condition of zoning, special land use permit or variance approval.
b.
Disturbance or encroachments.
1.
Ditches, swales, stormwater conveyance facilities, stormwater detention ponds, sanitary sewer conveyance facilities, and any associated easements, shall not encroach into a buffer except that necessary access and utility crossings (e.g. stormwater or sanitary sewer pipes) may encroach into the buffer as near to perpendicular as practical.
2.
Supplemental plantings or replantings of vegetation or authorized non-vegetative screening devices shall be authorized to encroach into a buffer provided there is minimal disturbance of any existing vegetation.
3.
Dying, diseased or dead vegetation may be removed from a buffer provided minimal disturbance occurs. Vegetation thus removed shall be replaced where necessary to meet the screening requirements contained herein.
c.
Protection during land disturbing activities.
1.
During authorized land disturbing activities, transitional buffer zones, stream buffers, and state buffer zones shall be clearly demarcated and protected prior to commencement of, and during, construction.
2.
The method of demarcation and protection utilized shall be in accordance with best management practices or as required by the arborist.
(j)
Parking lot landscaping.
(1)
Off-street parking lots which contain more than twenty (20) off-street parking spaces on any single lot shall contain landscaping and plantings as provided in Chapter 27 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances.
(2)
Variances to reduce required parking spaces may be granted by the zoning board of appeals when necessary to preserve a significant tree(s) that otherwise would be lost if the parking requirements were strictly applied. Such variance may only be granted if the arborist certifies to the zoning board of appeals that such tree(s) will be lost either by necessary removal for construction of the parking lot or as a consequence of construction having an adverse impact on the survivability of the tree by virtue of damage to the root system of the tree(s).
(3)
Any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall include a condition that should the subject tree(s) die as a consequence, direct or indirect, of construction, despite granting of the variance, the tree or trees shall be replaced at the property owner's or applicant's expense, in accordance with a tree replacement plan approved by the arborist.
(4)
The maximum variance allowed under this provision shall be four (4) parking spaces, or ten (10) percent of the total number of parking spaces required by the zoning ordinance, whichever is greater.
(k)
Street trees. Street trees and continuous landscape strips shall be provided, in conformance with the design requirements specified in Chapter 27 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances, along newly constructed streets, and along existing streets which are widened or realigned subsequent to the adoption of this ordinance, in all office, commercial, and industrial developments and along newly constructed streets of residential developments with a net residential density exceeding three (3) dwelling units per acre or as otherwise directed by conditions of zoning or special land use permits.
(l)
Maintenance. Trees which are used to meet the density requirements for this section 14-39, except on single family residential lots, shall be maintained for two (2) growing seasons after the date of final inspection. The property owner shall maintain required tree density. The applicant or builder will be responsible for identifying newly planted trees to the homeowner and to inform the homeowner as to their proper maintenance.
(m)
Alternative compliance. The county arborist must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall one hundred (100) percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. Where the county arborist has determined that special constraints of a site result in an inability to provide the required tree density, the number of trees will be determined by the county arborist based on site review. Such site review shall require the developer to re-landscape each parcel using a density calculated as the maximum number of trees that can be sustained on the parcel less the impervious area of that parcel. The balance of trees shall be provided in common areas. If common areas are not sufficient, any remaining balance of trees may be provided for plantings on public grounds. Tree bank arrangements can be made through the director. The minimum size of trees replanted through the tree bank shall be two (2) caliper inches and shall be planted in accordance with the species list attached as appendix a hereto and in accordance with the requirements in subsection (h), tree replacement standards.
(1)
Common area planting. If trees are to be planted at another location, the following note must appear on the approved tree protection plan: "A tree protection plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the county arborist at least thirty (30) days prior to requesting a final inspection. This plan shall include the species, size and location of trees to be planted off-site to meet the tree density deficit shown. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy is subject to approval of this plan, as well as verification of the installation of the trees."
(2)
Tree banking. If trees can not be planted on site and there is insufficient common area for replanting, the balance of trees will be accepted by the director for tree banking within unincorporated DeKalb County. Participants in the tree banking program administered by the director, including the signing of an off-site reforestation agreement.
(n)
Tree harvesting. Selective tree harvesting may be permitted upon authorization by the zoning board of appeals in consultation with the arborist. Permits authorizing tree harvesting shall be in accordance with the following standards:
(1)
A seventy-five-foot undisturbed buffer shall be provided and maintained along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages, during the land disturbing activity, except for authorized access crossings.
(2)
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no property owner shall be required to preserve an undisturbed buffer that covers more than twenty-five (25) percent of the total land area of the property, excluding area inside the one hundred-year floodplain. In any such case, an alternative buffer width shall be provided, as determined by the zoning board of appeals pursuant to its review of the application for a tree harvesting permit.
(3)
The property shall be required to meet a tree density standard of thirty (30) units per acre, not including the seventy-five-foot buffer, upon completion of authorized land disturbing activities.
(4)
The owner/applicant shall utilize the recommended best management practices as established by the Georgia Forestry Commission.
(5)
No tree harvesting shall be allowed within the county except after approval of a special exception by the zoning board of appeals as is provided in Article V, Division 4 of Chapter 27 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances. Further, subsequent to such approval of a special exception, no such tree harvesting shall be undertaken on any nonresidential parcel of land unless the transitional buffer zones required by the zoning regulations of the district in which located, are preserved in a natural and undisturbed state.
(6)
Once tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the above regulations, no development of the property shall be permitted that would require the cutting of trees preserved under subsection (n)(3) and (n)(5) for a period of five (5) years following authorization of tree harvesting.
(o)
Utility company and public works guidelines.
(1)
All utility companies shall be required to obtain an annual permit issued by the director. All applications for an annual permit shall include a list of subcontractors with names, addresses, and county business license numbers.
(2)
Periodic work schedules are to be submitted to the arborist showing the proposed location and extent of tree work to be performed.
a.
All tree trimming and pruning to be performed by public utilities, public agencies, and their subcontractors on trees growing on private or public rights-of-way shall be done according to the National Arborist Association Standards for Pruning of Shade Trees.
b.
The routing of public and private utility easements shall be subject to review and comment by the county arborist.
(p)
Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the director to enforce this tree protection ordinance. The director shall have the authority to, and the county arborist may recommend that, the director revoke, suspend or void any land disturbance permit, development permit or building permit or suspend all work on a site or portion thereof in order to effect compliance with this section.
(1)
Violation and penalty. Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this section, after having been first issued a warning, shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction in court of competent jurisdiction shall be punished as is provided in section 1-10 of the Code of DeKalb County. Each tree removed or killed in violation of this section 14-39 shall be considered a separate offense. The owner of any buildings or premises or parts thereof, where anything in violation of this section exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense.
(2)
Any trees eight (8) inches (DBH) and over which have been removed in violation of this section shall be replaced by the violator with four-inch caliper replacement trees equal to the unit value of the trees removed. However, any specimen tree removed from a parcel shall be replaced with four-inch caliper trees one and five-tenths (1.5) times the equivalent inches (DBH) of replacement trees or existing trees in excess of the requirements of subsection (g), tree preservation and replacement requirements, using species with potentials for comparable size and quality at maturity.
(3)
Additional legal remedies. In addition to all other actions and penalties authorized in this section, the department of law is hereby authorized to institute injunctive, abatement or any other appropriate judicial or administrative actions or proceedings to prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove any violations of this section.
(4)
Appeals; power and duty of the board to hear appeals of decisions of administrative officials. The zoning board of appeals shall have the power and duty to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by an aggrieved party that there is error in any final order, requirement, or decision made by the director based on or made in the enforcement of the tree protection ordinance. all such appeals shall be heard and decided following the notice requirements, criteria and procedural requirements in Chapter 27 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances.
(5)
Administrative variances. Front, side and rear yard setbacks and parking requirements may be reduced by an amount not to exceed fifty (50) percent where it is determined by the county arborist to be necessary in order to preserve existing specimen or significant trees. Appropriate conditions to said administrative variances shall be imposed so as to ensure the continued health of said trees following the granting of such variances, including mandatory replacement requirements. Such administrative variances shall be considered and decided consistent with the procedures and criteria contained in Chapter 27 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances. Appeals of final decisions regarding administrative variances may be taken as provided in subsection (p)(4) above.
(6)
Special exception. The zoning board of appeals is authorized to consider requests for special exception for the removal of an unauthorized specimen tree. All such requests shall be filed, notice given, and all procedures shall be as is required in the zoning ordinance. No such special exception for the unauthorized removal of a specimen tree shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals unless the applicant has demonstrated and the board has found that the property is not capable of earning a reasonable economic return absent the grant of the special exception. In making this determination the board shall consider the following factors:
a.
Value of the trees in question, considering their age, size, health, and significance;
b.
The current level of economic return on the property;
c.
The marketability of the property; and the unfeasibility of alternate design or uses. Appeals from final decisions of the board shall be as provided for in Chapter 27 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances. _____

(a)
The governing authority believes the county's stream systems are a valuable natural resource that requires joint and cooperative action by the county and the development industry to resolve existing stormwater management and flooding problems, prevention of their worsening or recurrence while utilizing this resource for the good of the entire county.
The development industry and the county shall cooperate to control water quality and maintain the county's drainage and stream systems from stormwater runoff resulting from development activities.
(b)
Applicability criteria for stormwater management and water quality control standards. This article applies to all development which meets one (1) or more of the following criteria:
(1)
Increases the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one (1) cubic foot per second for a ten-year frequency storm;
(2)
Involves the creation or addition of five thousand (5,000) square feet or greater of impervious surface area, or that involves land development activities of one (1) acre of land or greater;
(3)
Includes the creation, addition or replacement in redevelopment (excluding routine maintenance and exterior modeling) of five thousand (5,000) square feet or greater of impervious surface area, or that involves land development activities of one (1) acre of land or greater;
(4)
Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is a hotspot land use as defined in this chapter; or
(5)
Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (1) through (3) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules;
(6)
New development and redevelopment if:
a.
Such new development or redevelopment is part of a subdivision or other common plan of development, and
b.
The sum of all associated impervious surface area or land disturbing activities that are being developed as part of such subdivision or other common plan of development meets or exceeds the threshold in (b)(2) and (b)(3) above;
(7)
Linear transportation projects that exceed the threshold in (b)(2) or (b)(3) above.
(c)
Exemptions. The stormwater management and water quality control standards shall not apply to the following criteria:
(1)
Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project unless they meet one (1) of the criteria listed above in subsection (b);
(2)
Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures unless it meets one (1) of the criteria listed above in subsection (b);
(3)
Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities as described respectively in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(5) and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(6) within areas zoned for these activities, with the exception of buildings and permanent structures that exceed the threshold in subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) above;
(4)
Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the administrator;
(5)
Land disturbing activity conducted by local, state, authority, or federal agencies, solely to respond to an emergency need to protect life, limb, or property or conduct emergency repairs;

(9)
Linear transportation projects being constructed by the county to the extent the administrator determines that the stormwater management standards may be infeasible to apply, all or in part, for any portion of the linear transportation project. For this exemption to apply, an infeasibility report that is compliant with the county linear feasibility program shall first be submitted to the administrator that contains adequate documentation to support the evaluation for the applicable portion(s) and any resulting infeasibility determination, if any, by the administrator.
(10)
The director may exempt the owner from those provisions of this article where complete compliance with those specific provisions is physically impossible.
(11)
The requirements, or portions thereof, of subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) above shall not be waived if the director determines that such waiver would increase known flooding problems, or exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system.
(12)
A waiver of these minimum runoff quantity control requirements may be granted only after a written request is submitted by the applicant containing descriptions, drawings, and any other information that is necessary to evaluate the proposed land disturbing activity. A separate written waiver request shall be required if there are subsequent additions, extensions, or modifications, to the development which would alter the approved stormwater runoff characteristics of a land disturbing activity receiving a waiver.
(13)
Appeals from said waiver decisions may be taken to the zoning board of appeals pursuant to the provisions of section 14-34(d).
(d)
Standards for stormwater management and water quality control. Subject to the applicable criteria in section 14-40(b) and exemptions in section 14-40(c), the following stormwater management standards apply. Additional details for each standard can be found in the GSMM. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this article and the GSMM, the provision of this article shall control:
(1)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction for the entire site which meets one (1) or more of the criteria in section 14-40(b).
(2)
Design of stormwater management system. The design of the stormwater management system shall be in accordance with the applicable sections of the GSMM as directed by the administrator. Any design which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for dam safety as applicable. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this article and the GSMM, the provision of this article shall control.
(3)
Natural resources inventory. Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic, found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan, shall include, at a minimum (as applicable):
a.
Topography (minimum of two-foot contours) and steep slopes (i.e., areas with slopes greater than fifteen (15) percent);
b.
Natural drainage divides and patterns;
c.
Natural drainage features (e.g., swales, basins, depressional areas);
d.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors;
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas); and
f.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(4)
Better site design practices for stormwater management. Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.
(5)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
a.
For development with stormwater management plan submitted before December 6, 2020, the applicant may choose either runoff reduction (subsection b.1.) or water quality (subsection b.2.) below;
b.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after December 6, 2020, the applicant shall choose runoff reduction (subsection 1. below) and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then water quality (subsection 2. below) shall apply for the remaining runoff from a one-half-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least eighty (80) percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
1.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first one (1.0) inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
2.
Water quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least eighty (80) percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a one-half-inch rainfall event.
c.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 14-40(b), the county may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(6)
Stream channel protection. Stream channel protection from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
b.
Erosion prevention measures, such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and
c.
Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of any applicable stream buffer.
(7)
Overbank flood protection. Downstream overbank flood protection and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided.
(8)
Extreme flood protection. Extreme flood protection and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(9)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten (10) percent of the total drainage area. A downstream peak flow analysis will include the assumptions, results and supporting calculations to show safe passage of post-development design flows downstream. The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainage channel or watercourse immediately downstream from the project. In calculating runoff volumes and discharge rates, consideration may need to be given to any planned future upstream land use changes. The analysis shall be in accordance with the GSMM. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(10)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the county, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system. This plan shall be written in accordance with the requirements in section 14-40(n).
(e)
General standards. The following provisions are not subject to the applicability criteria in section 14-40(b) and exemptions in section 14-40(c), and are applicable to all developments, redevelopment and constructions activities.
(1)
If forty (40) percent or less of a site is to be redeveloped, all stormwater requirements must be met for the redeveloped area only and the non-disturbed area will be treated as predeveloped prior to the redevelopment. But if more than forty (40) percent of the site is to be redeveloped, then the entire site must meet all stormwater requirements.
(2)
Detention designs may be rejected by the director if they incorporate structures and facilities that will demand considerable maintenance or will be difficult to maintain or will utilize numerous small structures if other alternatives are physically possible.
(3)
Discharge velocities from detention facilities shall be reduced to provide a non-erosive velocity flow from a structure, channel, or other control measure as set forth in the approved GSMM.
(4)
Stormwater management and flood control facilities may include both structural and nonstructural components. Natural or planted vegetation as well as other natural runoff conduits are examples of these non-structural components and shall be retained where practicable. In addition, these components must provide for or enhance stormwater quantity and/or quality control or other stormwater benefits.
(5)
The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a one-hundred-year storm event.
(6)
The drainage system from a proposed development must discharge into an outfall that has adequate capacity to accommodate the runoff from the development. If the connecting downstream system is not able to accommodate the allowable design flows from the site, then the design engineer must design drainage facilities with the capacity to over-detain flows so they can be accommodated by the existing downstream conveyance structures, whereby allowing the existing downstream system to operate correctly. If downstream easements are needed to extend the drainage system to an adequate outfall, the developer shall obtain these easements.
(7)
A landscaping plan shall be submitted for all detention and other storage facilities as part of the overall drainage plan.
(8)
Land uses within the intermediate regional floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream, its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other stormwater management facilities or systems and shall not increase the IRF elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. The development permit shall be denied if the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the intermediate regional floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the intermediate regional floodplain. Altered sections of the intermediate regional floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt buildup.
(9)
Excavation within floodplain areas shall not be permitted unless the excavation can be accomplished in such a manner that the existing low level drainage pattern through the floodplain shall be maintained. The area of compensation within the floodplain shall be considered as ineffective flow area for the purpose of calculating floodplain elevations to meet no-rise certification requirements. The amount of compensation shall be limited to one hundred fifty (150) cubic yards per acre of floodplain area.
(10)
The live detention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the one-hundred-year frequency rainfall as published in the GSMM. The detention system required shall be necessary to handle the runoff of a one-hundred-year rainfall, for any and all durations from the post-development, with a release rate that does not exceed the pre-development release rate during the same duration storm. Detention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners.
(11)
When the applicant requests and the director determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined detention or other stormwater management facilities more practical, the county may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two (2) or more properties by two (2) or more applicants. This authorization shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals upon application for approval being submitted through the director. Where joint detention facilities serving two (2) or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the detention facility, except upon approval of the zoning board of appeals.
(12)
The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all stormwater and sedimentation control facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater runoff:
a.
Permanent fencing at least four (4) feet in height shall be required around all facilities having a temporary water storage depth of greater than four (4) feet or those designated by the board of health as constituting a public health hazard.
b.
This fencing shall be designed, installed and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment into the facility. Fencing shall be established on the outside edge of a facility. The fence shall include a gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities. The gate shall be placed in a manner such that the gate does not obstruct reasonable access or become obstructive. The director may waive fencing in nonresidential areas where a pond is more than five hundred (500) feet from a residential district and in residential districts when detention is provided in natural areas such as stream channels and fencing in the opinion of the director would damage the environment or affect stream flow.
c.
The access easement to the facility shall not have a profile slope steeper than thirty-three (33) percent and a cross slope of no more than ten (10) percent. The elevation of the maintenance easement around the facility shall be established at the top of the dam or wall elevation and be constructed with a cross slope of no more than ten (10) percent to the drainage facility. Fencing that complies with the requirement of section 14-40(e)(12)b. shall be constructed on the outside edge of the maintenance easement. Gates that comply with the requirements of section 14-40(e)(12)b. shall be constructed on each maintenance easement.
d.
Detention and sedimentation control facilities shall not be placed in any of the following:
1.
Transitional buffer zones as defined in chapter 27.
2.
Floodplains.
3.
Wetlands.
4.
Stream buffer zones.
5.
State buffer zones.
e.
Perforated standpipes or a french drain, in accordance with published design standards available from the director, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing water and inadequate drainage shall be installed within all the detention and sedimentation control facilities.
f.
The commercial, single-family, and/or multifamily residential property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater management facilities during grading, construction, and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance and certification obligation shall be binding on all future owners, successors and assigns of the property.
g.
In the case of single-family residential subdivisions, the county is not responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater management or detention facilities except as provided below.
1.
The subdivision is included in a special drainage or tax district and is so noted on the final recorded plat; or
2.
The county has accepted the stormwater management or detention facilities for maintenance and is so noted on the final recorded plat.
(13)

(a)
Land development requirements. All land development activity shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
Stream buffers shall consist of the contiguous undisturbed natural vegetative land a minimum of seventy-five (75) feet from each stream bank measured horizontally on both banks of the stream from the top of the stream bank. Stream buffers shall preserve any existing mature riparian forest that can provide shade, leaf litter, woody debris and erosion protection to the stream. Land use in the stream buffer is limited to unpaved footpaths, and utility or roadway crossings, except as otherwise provided in this section.
(2)
The stormwater discharge crossing a stream buffer shall be designed to ensure that sheet flow is established through the stream buffer and prevent channelized flow through the stream buffer.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the stream buffer.
(4)
Piping of streams shall not be allowed in a stream buffer except where a variance is granted as provided in section 14-44.1 et seq. However, perpendicular utility crossings such as sewer pipes and water pipes shall be allowed, but shall be kept to an absolute minimum.
(5)
Within the stream buffer, a property owner may remove unwanted ground cover (e.g. poison ivy) using hand tools, and in conformance with subsection 14-38(b)(4)c.15.
(b)
Authorized stream buffer encroachments. Encroachments within the stream buffer shall be allowed only in the following manner in the following areas:

No stream buffer variances shall be granted by the director within the twenty-five (25) feet of the county buffer nearest the stream. No stream buffer variance shall be granted by the planning commission. Any sketch plat, preliminary plat or final plat, that contains a delineation, drawing or language construed to be a stream buffer variance shall be void and of no effect. The only method by which a stream buffer variance may be obtained by an applicant is to comply with the requirements of section 14-44.1 et seq.
(2)
New construction/new development. No stream buffer variance shall be granted by the director within the county buffer if the applicant is constructing a structure on vacant land. However, vacant lots existing and validly platted in the real estate records of the Clerk of the Superior Court of DeKalb County prior to February 24, 2009, that would otherwise be unbuildable as a result of the stream buffer restrictions set forth in section 14-44.1 et seq. may obtain a stream buffer variance from the director to encroach into the county buffer so long as the applicant complies with all of the requirements for the variance as set forth in section 14-44.1 et seq.
(3)
Lot coverage. No stream buffer variance shall be granted by the director if the proposed encroachment created by the variance shall allow an applicant to exceed the allowable maximum lot coverage for the property at issue.
(4)
General variance requirements for redevelopment of any kind of existing structures. In all cases, where any kind of existing structure(s) encroaches into the stream buffer and any such existing structure(s) is to be demolished in whole or in part and replaced with a new structure or a new addition, no stream buffer variance shall be granted if the total size of the new encroachment exceeds twenty (20) percent of the total square footage of the existing encroachment of the structure prior to demolition. In such cases, the new encroachment shall be kept furthest from the stream.
(5)
Redevelopment of existing multifamily residential, commercial or institutional structures.
a.
No stream buffer variance shall be granted for the redevelopment of existing multifamily residential, commercial or institutional structures if the structure was constructed after December 28, 2000, the date of the initial enactment of the fifty-foot county stream buffer.
b.
Existing multifamily structures, existing commercial structures and existing institutional structures erected prior to the enactment of the fifty-foot stream buffer may obtain a stream buffer variance within the outer twenty-five (25) feet of the county buffer, but such variance shall be limited to a maximum depth of ten (10) feet into the outer county twenty-five-foot stream buffer. The director shall verify that the subject multifamily residential, commercial or institutional structure possesses all required county permits before a variance may be issued. Existing multifamily residential, commercial or institutional structures which are proposed for redevelopment or enlargement may obtain a stream buffer variance provided that the encroachment remains the same and does not alter the existing building footprint resting in the stream buffer.
c.
No stream buffer variance shall be granted by the director for additions or redevelopment of existing multifamily residential, commercial or institutional structures within the existing or year 2025 built-out condition flood plain.
(6)
Redevelopment or addition to existing single-family residential structures.

The director shall have no power to consider or to grant variances which are the responsibility of the director of the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 and other relevant state statutes and regulations.
(d)
The director is only authorized to consider applications for variances within the twenty-five (25) feet of the county stream buffer farthest from the stream, but not within the twenty-five (25) feet of the state buffer adjacent to waters of the state or within the twenty-five feet (25) feet of the county stream buffer nearest the stream.
(e)
Where variances involving the same project are requested from both the director of the EPD and the director, the director may take no action on any such request for variance until the director of the EPD grants the variance or otherwise approves the request pending before the EPD.
(f)
Receiving a variance from the director of the EPD does not obligate the director to permit the project to proceed if the project does not also meet all the other requirements of this article.
(g)
The director has the discretion to deny any variance application based on:
(1)
The condition of the stream on the property;
(2)
Upstream and downstream condition of the stream; and
(3)
The steams that are listed in 303(d) registry of the state.
(h)
No variance from the provisions of section 14-44.1 et seq. may be authorized except as specifically authorized herein or specifically authorized in another section of chapter 14. No stream buffer variance shall be approved within the existing or year 2025 built-out condition flood plain.
(i)
In considering a request for a variance to the terms of this article, the director shall consider all of the following criteria:
(1)
Whether the request, while not strictly meeting the requirements of chapter 14, will, in the judgment of the director, be at least as protective of natural resources and the environment as would a plan which met the strict application of these requirements. In making such a judgment, the director shall examine whether the request will be at least as protective of the natural resources and the environment and shall consider the following factors:
a.
Stream bank or soil stabilization.
b.
Trapping of sediment in surface runoff.
c.
Removal of nutrients, heavy metals, pesticides and other pollutants from surface runoff.
d.
Terrestrial habitat, food chain, and migration corridor.
e.
Buffering of flood flows.
f.
Infiltration of surface runoff.
g.
Noise and visual buffers.
h.
Downstream water quality.
i.
Impact on threatened and endangered species, as those species are designated by law or federal or state regulation. The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property.
j.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries.
k.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion.
l.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion.
m.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance.
(2)
Whether by reason of exceptional topographic or other relevant physical conditions of the subject property that was not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for any development under any design configuration unless a variance is granted.
(3)
Whether the request goes beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief and constitutes a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties that are similarly situated.
(4)
Whether the grant of the variance will be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the area in which the property is located.
(5)
Whether the applicant has provided a mitigation plan designed and stamped by Georgia-licensed design professionals and whether that proposed mitigation plan is:
a.
Nonstructural;
b.
Designed to improve the quality of the stream and the associated buffer; and
c.
Includes a planting schedule and channel protection design.
(6)
Whether the literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of chapter 14 would cause an extreme hardship, so long as the hardship is not created by the owner. The applicant is responsible for providing proof of hardship. The proof shall demonstrate the difficult site conditions and possible alternate designs. The director shall not grant any stream buffer variances if the actions of the property owner of a given property have created the conditions of hardship on the property.
(j)
The director shall decide whether to grant or deny the variance and his decision shall be in writing, shall state the basis for the decision, and shall be made no more than forty-five (45) days following receipt of a complete application. In the decision, the director shall specifically reference and describe the factors listed in subsection (i) above that were considered and utilized in making the variance decision.
(k)
Any county projects, other than those exempted in section 14-44.2, are required to obtain a stream buffer variance. For such projects, encroachments shall be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the project goal and shall be limited to specific locations within the county fifty-foot buffer. Appeal of a variance approval or denial for a county project shall be made to the board of commissioners.
