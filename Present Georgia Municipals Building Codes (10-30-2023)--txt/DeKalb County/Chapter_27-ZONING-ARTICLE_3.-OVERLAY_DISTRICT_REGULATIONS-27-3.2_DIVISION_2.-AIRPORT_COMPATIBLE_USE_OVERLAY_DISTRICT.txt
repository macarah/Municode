Sec. 3.2.4. - Airport Compatible Use Overlay Districts established.
To achieve the purpose and intent of this division, all of the land within the boundaries of airfields and within one (1) mile of the runway centerline extended of each instrument runway affected, for a distance of two and five-tenths (2.5) miles from each end of such runway, is declared to be an Airport Compatible Use Zone (ACUZ), divided into three (3) sub-zones as follows:
A.
ACUZ-1: From the end of the runway extending outward in a fan-shape fashion to match the horizontal extent of the approach-departure clearance surface for a distance of three thousand (3,000) feet.
B.
ACUZ-2: From the end of ACUZ-1 to a point two and five-tenths (2.5) miles from the end of the runway, extending in a fan-shaped fashion to match the horizontal extent of the approach-departure clearance surface.
C.
ACUZ-3: All of the ACUZ not included in ACUZ-1 or ACUZ-2.
The boundaries of these zones are drawn on maps and are available for inspection during office hours in the offices of the DeKalb County Planning Department.

Sec. 3.2.5. - Height of buildings and structures.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, no obstructions to air navigation, structure or natural growth, shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or be maintained in such a height or manner so as to become an obstruction to air navigation.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 3.2.6. - Use restrictions.
A.
No use may be made of land within the ACUZ that results in an electrical interference with radio communications between the airfield and aircraft; generates airborne smoke or dust into the atmosphere; makes it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airfield lights and other lights; results in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airfield; impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airfield; attracts birds; or otherwise endangers the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft.
B.
Within ACUZ-1 no public assembly, restaurant, or educational classroom uses shall be permitted which results in a density of occupation greater than twenty-five (25) persons per acre of land. Other uses may be permitted provided they meet all requirements of this section and have received a special administrative permit from the director of public works. Such application shall be forwarded to the director of the department of aviation of DeKalb County within five (5) days of its receipt by the department of public works. The director of the department of aviation shall return written comments to the department of public works within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application. Said comments shall contain a determination that granting the permit would, or would not, constitute a hazard to air navigation.
C.
Within ACUZ-1, no residential use shall be continued after it has been discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days unless a special administrative permit is issued by the director of public works. Such application shall be forwarded to the director of the department of aviation within five (5) days of its receipt by the department of public works.

Sec. 3.2.7. - Permits for certain other future uses.
Within ACUZ-1, no material change shall be made in the use of land, and no structure or natural growth shall be materially erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established, in the ACUZ-1 unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted by the director of public works, subject to review by the director of the department of aviation of DeKalb County, as set forth in section 3.2.6. above. Each such application shall indicate the purpose for which the desired use structure, or natural growth is intended, a boundary survey indicating the location of the property and the location, dimensions, and height above mean sea level of any new or altered structure or natural growth, and a written description of the manner in which it would conform to the regulations prescribed in this section. No such permit shall be granted that would:
A.
Allow the establishment, creation, extension, or maintenance of a use which is inconsistent with the provisions of this section;
B.
Permit a non-conforming use, structure, or natural growth to be made, become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation or become less compatible in use than it was on the effective date of this chapter or from the date when application for a permit is made.
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)
Sec. 3.2.8. - Permits for certain other existing uses.

No permit shall be granted that would:
A.
Allow the establishment, creation, extension, or maintenance of or extend a use which is inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
