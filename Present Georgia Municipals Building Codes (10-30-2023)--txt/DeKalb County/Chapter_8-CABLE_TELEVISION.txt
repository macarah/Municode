Within such time as is prescribed by the chief executive, the grantee shall satisfy the complaint or advise the chief executive of its refusal or inability to do so. If the grantee satisfied the complaint, it shall so notify the chief executive. The chief executive will forward a copy of the notice of satisfaction to the complainant. If the system refuses or is unable to satisfy the complaint, it shall so notify the chief executive, and the chief executive will forward a copy of this notice to the complainant, with a statement of the procedure to be followed to further prosecute the complaint.

The board of commissioners may take such action with regard to the complaint as it considers appropriate. If no complaint is filed with the board of commissioners within the six-month period, the complainant will be deemed to have abandoned.
