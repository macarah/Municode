--- (16) ---
Editor's note— Part I of Ord. No. 13-10, adopted May 28, 2013, added provisions designated as Art. X, §§ 2-300—2-310. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, and to maintain the format of the Code, the provisions have been redesignated as Art. X, §§ 2-450—2-460, at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 2-450. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
Article IX, section II, paragraph VI of the Georgia Constitution gives the governing authority the power to create special districts for the provision of local government services within such districts, and to levy and collect taxes within such districts to pay for the cost of providing such services.
(b)
Private sewer systems collect, treat, transport, and dispose of sewage, which is water-carried waste including human excrement and grey water.
(c)
If a private sewer system is deficient and in need of repair, blockages, seepage, and overflows of sewage can occur. Often, private sewer systems are not constructed in compliance with current county specifications, and are not repaired in a manner that reduces or eliminates blockages, spills and deficiencies.
(d)
When blockages and overflows occur in private sewer systems, untreated sewage may spill over into the county's waterways, which adversely affects the county's water quality and jeopardizes the health and welfare of county citizens.
(e)
The governing authority finds that failing private sewer systems may create potentially significant public health and safety hazards for all residents of the county. The governing authority further finds that costs associated with seepages, blockages and overflows can be burdensome and, thus, it is in the best interests of all residents of the county to assist in the repair and upgrade of failing private sewer systems so that such systems can be incorporated into the county's public sewer system.
(f)
To achieve this public purpose, the governing authority wants to make available a process to correct the failings in private sewer systems and thereafter incorporate these private sewer systems into the county's public sewer system.
(g)
This article establishes a process to improve, regulate, maintain and operate sewer systems in special sewer tax districts (hereinafter referred to as "sewer tax districts") comprised of defined areas of the unincorporated county served by failing private sewer systems, as that term is defined in this article.
(h)
Once a sewer tax district is created and the county repairs and upgrades the failing private sewer system, then the chief executive officer shall formally accept the private sewer system into the county's public sewer system. After the sewer improvements are completed, and the cost of the repair and upgrade is fully paid by the collection of taxes within the sewer tax district, then the sewer tax district shall be dissolved by operation of law.
(i)
Once a failing private sewer system is upgraded to current specifications and/or repaired and incorporated in the county's public sewer system, then the governing authority believes that blockages, seepages and overflows of untreated sewage in the county's waterways will be reduced. Therefore, creating special sewer tax districts as provided in this article protects the health and welfare of the county's citizens by improving the water quality of the county's waterways, and is a cost-efficient method of reducing blockages, spills and overflows from failing private sewer systems.
G)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to require the governing authority to approve any request to establish a sewer tax district, and it shall be in the sole legislative judgment of the governing authority to approve the establishment of any such sewer tax district.
(k)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the governing authority from creating a sewer tax district if it determines that the sewer tax district is required to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county, and it shall be in the sole legislative judgment of the governing authority to make a determination to establish any such sewer tax district.
(l)
This article shall not be used to create a sewer tax district to repair individual sewer service lines or laterals that run from a public or private sewer main to a structure, as such sewer service lines or laterals are regulated in chapter 25 of this Code. Repair, upgrade, and replacement of such sewer service lines or laterals remain the responsibility of the owner of the structure.
(m)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to provide a mechanism to create sewer tax districts to service property that houses apartments, or to service a commercial, business, industrial, or office structure, enterprise or development.
( Ord. No. 13-10 , Pt. I, 5-28-13)
Sec. 2-451. - Definitions.
Words or phrases not defined in this article but defined in applicable state law or the Code shall be given that meaning.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them below, except where the text clearly indicates a different meaning:
Apartment means a building containing four (4) or more independent, self-contained, residential units; each independent, self-contained, residential unit must be comprised of one (1) or more rooms, designed, occupied or intended for occupancy as separate living quarters, with cooking, sleeping, and bathroom facilities. The term "apartment" does not include a condominium as that term is defined in state law.
Complete petition means a petition that includes: (i) the signatures of the required number of owners of the property lying within the proposed sewer tax district in favor of such designation; and (ii) an accurate description of the property to be included in the proposed sewer tax district, including tax map parcel identification numbers, as used by the tax assessor and the tax commissioner. The petition is subject to verification of property owner signature(s) and property owner(s) boundary lines by the director of watershed management.
Costs or costs incurred within a sewer tax district means the actual cost of designing, repairing, upgrading and constructing the sewer improvements in the sewer tax district, including the actual cost of surveying; engineering design; fee simple, right-of-way and/or easement acquisition; construction, financing, legal and other related expenses; and the county's administrative costs. Costs shall be amortized over a period of ten (10) years for each individual sewer tax district.
Failing private sewer system means a private sewer system that has been determined to be in need of repair and deficient in a written, sealed engineering report prepared by a civil engineer licensed by the State of Georgia.

Sec. 2-458. - Acceptance of the private sewer system as part of the county public sewer system.
(a)
Private sewer systems located within a county easement or right-of-way. If the governing authority creates a sewer tax district for a private sewer system located within a county easement or right-of-way, and if the director of watershed management certifies in writing that the necessary sewer improvements in the sewer tax district have been completed so that the sewer system is no longer failing and complies with all applicable requirements of law, including the time requirements in subsection (c), then upon receipt of such written certification, the chief executive officer shall execute the necessary documents, if any are needed, to accept the private sewer system as part of the county's public sewer system. Thereafter, the sewer system in the sewer tax district shall be part of the county's public sewer system, subject to county repair, upgrade requirements, and conditions for that system.
(b)
Private sewer systems located on private property. If the governing authority creates a sewer tax district for a private sewer system located on private property, and if the director of watershed management certifies in writing that the necessary sewer improvements in the sewer tax district have been completed so that the sewer system is no longer failing and complies with all applicable requirements of law, including the time requirements in subsection (c), then upon receipt of such written certification, the chief executive officer shall execute the necessary legal documents, if any are needed, to accept the private sewer system as part of the county's public sewer system.

Sec. 2-459. - Calculation of taxes to be assessed in the sewer tax district.
(a)
The property owners in the sewer tax district collectively shall pay fifty (50) percent of the costs incurred within a sewer tax district, but in no event shall each property owner's share of costs exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00). The county shall pay fifty (50) percent of the same costs, or a greater amount if necessary to enforce the seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00) cap. Each property owner in the sewer tax district shall be responsible for and pay his/her pro rata share of the costs, which shall be divided equally among all property owners within such district on the basis of the number of lots, whether improved or unimproved, or on the basis of the number of condominium units, as that term is defined by state law. Owners of exempt properties shall not be included in the calculation of costs.
(b)
Each year, the finance director shall be responsible for calculating each property owner's annual pro rata share of the costs, in accordance with the provisions of this article. The tax commissioner shall be responsible for collecting from the property owners payment of their pro rata share of the fifty (50) percent of costs incurred within a sewer tax district. The finance director and tax commissioner shall be notified by the executive assistant at such time as the sewer tax district is approved to commence the collection and receipt of monies in payment of estimated assessment rates. Beginning January 1 of the year following the creation of the tax district and for each year thereafter, the tax statement issued to each such property owner shall include a separate line item tax showing each property owner's annual pro rata share of the costs until paid. When all work within an approved sewer tax district is complete, the finance director and tax commissioner shall adjust estimated assessment rates pursuant to subsection 2-458(c) to reflect all costs incurred within a sewer tax district.
(c)
The fifty (50) percent of costs, as limited by the seven thousand five hundred dollar ($7,500.00) cap, shall be the special services sewer tax and shall become due and payable at the same time that other county taxes are due and payable. If such tax remains unpaid, the tax commissioner shall have the authority to issue a writ of fieri facias or execution against the property served, which writ shall have the same lien dignity and priority as writs of fieri facias or executions issued for other county taxes. Each annual special services sewer tax shall become a lien against the property served on January l of each year in the same manner that a lien attaches for other county taxes, and such lien shall cover the property of the owner until such special services sewer tax is paid. Any unpaid amount shall accrue penalty, interest and charges in the same manner and at the same rate as other delinquent county taxes.

Sec. 2-460. - Dissolution of the sewer tax district.
On December 31 of the tenth year following creation of a sewer tax district, the sewer tax district shall stand dissolved by operation of law.
