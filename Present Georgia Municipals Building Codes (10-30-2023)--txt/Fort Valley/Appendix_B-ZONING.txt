(Ord. of 4-19-2001)
[Sec.] V. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
A.
Preferred location sites.
1.
Collocation sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this ordinance and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the inspector or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive.
2.
Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flagpoles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches.
3.
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations, particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility.
4.
Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
B.
Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multifamily duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.
(Ord. of 4-19-2001)
[Sec.] VI. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities.
A.
General requirements for all telecommunication facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance.
1.
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the inspector.
2.
Regulatory compliance.
a.
All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
b.
Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
3.
Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
4.
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the inspector may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
5.
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this ordinance are met.
6.
Visual impact.
a.
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
b.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background.
c.
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
d.
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency.
e.
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
7.
Landscaping.
a.
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property.
b.
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
c.
The inspector may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the inspector.
8.
Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
9.
Principal, accessory and joint uses.
a.
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
b.
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area.
10.
Lot size and setbacks.
a.
The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities; provided, however, that the inspector may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby.
i.
Telecommunications towers must be setback a distance equal to 110 percent of the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
ii.
Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
iii.
Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section VII.
b.
For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires [a] ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
B.
Additional requirements for towers.
1.
Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
2.
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
3.
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
4.
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable.
5.
When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be setback from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to 100 percent of its total height.
6.
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district.
7.
Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
8.
Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
9.
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
(Ord. of 4-19-2001)
[Sec.] VII. - Application procedures.

The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The inspector shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means.
e.
The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site.
4.
[ Other information. ] The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the inspector to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility.
B.
Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant to section IV of this ordinance and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the inspector will expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within 14 business days after receipt of a complete application.
C.
Special use permits.
1.
A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the inspector and handled in accordance with the special use permit provisions of the Code of Ordinances. A special use permit may be issued under this section provided it is determined that all of the requirements of section VI have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties.
2.
The granting [of] a special use permit may result in the imposition of additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties.
(Ord. of 4-19-2001)
