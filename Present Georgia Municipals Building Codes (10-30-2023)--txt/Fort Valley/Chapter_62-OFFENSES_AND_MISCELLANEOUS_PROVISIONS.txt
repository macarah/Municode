(a)
Findings and intent. The mayor and city council finds and declares as follows:
(1)
In 2007, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report entitled "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking," which can be found at http:/www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/underagedrinking/calltoaction.pdf. (Surgeon General's Call to Action.)
(2)
"Early alcohol consumption by some young people will result in an alcohol use disorder-that is, they will meet diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 4.)
(3)
"A higher percentage of youth in 8th, 10th and 12th grades used alcohol in the month prior to being surveyed than used tobacco or marijuana, the illicit drug most commonly used by adolescents." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 5.)
(4)
Various surveys have found that: approximately ten percent of children who are nine to ten years old have started drinking alcoholic beverages; nearly 33 percent of youth start drinking alcoholic beverages before the age of 13; more than ten percent of youth who are 12 to 13 years old and over 33 percent of youth who are 14 to 15 years old reported drinking a whole alcoholic beverage in the year before they were surveyed, and the peak years of alcohol initiation are when youth are in 7th and 8th grades. (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 6.)
(5)
While adolescents typically drink alcohol beverages less often than adults, when they do drink alcohol beverages, adolescents tend to drink more alcoholic beverages at each event than adults. (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at pages 6-7.)
(6)
Persons who are less than the age of 21 often possess or consume alcoholic beverages at social parties or gatherings held at or on property under control of a person who either has provided the alcoholic beverages or who knows or reasonably should know of such conduct, but fails to take steps to prevent it.
(7)
"Annually, about 5,000 people under age 21 die from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10.)
(8)
Underage drinking "plays a significant role in risky sexual behavior, including unwanted, unintended and unprotected sexual activity, and sex with multiple partners. Such behavior increases the risk of unplanned pregnancy and for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10.)
(9)
Underage drinking "increases the risk of physical and sexual assault." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10.)
(10)
Underage drinking "can cause a range of physical consequences, from hangovers to death from alcohol poisoning." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11.)
(11)
Underage drinking "can cause alterations in the structure and function of the developing brain, which continues to mature into the mid to late twenties and may have consequences reaching far beyond adolescence." (Surgeon General's Cal to Action, at page 11.)
(12)
Underage drinking "causes secondhand effects that can put others at risk. Loud and unruly behavior, property destruction, unintentional injuries, violence, and even death because of underage alcohol use afflict innocent parties. For instance, about 45 percent of people who die in car crashes involving a drinking driver under the age of 21 are people other than the driver." (Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11.)
(13)
There is concern about underage persons obtaining and consuming alcoholic beverages at functions under the control of adults who know or should know of such conduct but fail to stop it.
(14)
This body finds that adults who knowingly allow underage drinking on property they control should be held responsible and accountable.
(15)
Too frequently, adults who are aware that underage drinking is illegal allow underage drinking at property they control knowing that they are not breaking the law so long as they don't directly provide the alcohol to minors. This body finds that this is a gap in the current laws that must be eliminated.
(16)
Law enforcement agency responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at parties or gatherings at or on private residences or other private property frequently require the use of extensive public resources. Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to such disturbances it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a party or gathering at or on private residence or other private property.
(17)
The prohibitions found in this section are reasonable and expected to deter the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21 by holding responsible persons who encourage, are aware of, or should be aware of the illegal conduct, yet fail to take steps to prevent it. In addition, the revenue received, after cost reimbursement to the responding law enforcement agency, will be directed toward law enforcement strategies and prevention programs.
(b)
