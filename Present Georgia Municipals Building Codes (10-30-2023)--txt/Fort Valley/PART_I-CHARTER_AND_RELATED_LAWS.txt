On May 13, 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice, acting pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Acts of 1965, refused to sanction the implementation of these provisions. Subsequent municipal elections before the 1991 amendment were conducted on a nonpost, plurality basis.

(Res. No. 04-0318-14, 3-18-2004)
Editor's note— Pursuant to memorandum from the city attorney in 1982, the following is stated: Prior to 1973, the Georgia Code section simply authorized the governing authority to fix the salary, compensation and expenses of municipal employees. The legislature then amended this section to allow the governing authority to fix the salary, compensation, and expenses of "the municipal employees and members of the governing authority" (1973 Ga. Laws, pages 778, 780). In 1979, the section was further amended to include the compensation of "any elective municipal official who exercises any executive or legislative or executive and legislative powers of the municipality, specifically including a mayor, vice-mayor, president or chairman of a city council, member of a city council, member of a board of aldermen, or member of a board of commissioners" (1979 Ga. Laws, pages 645, 648). It appears that these provisions have impliedly repealed the salary limitations stated in section 13 of the Charter as to mayor and council. It also appears that the limitation on the former recorder's salary was likewise repealed in view of the provisions of section 3 of the Charter that his compensation was fixed in the same manner as salaries of the mayor and aldermen. It is doubtful that the salary limitations as to the chairman and members of the utility commission were repealed by the state law. The 1979 amendment cited above applied only to compensation of elective municipal officials who exercise executive or legislative powers of the municipality, which a utility commissioner does not exercise.
Sec. 14. - Executive powers of mayor.
The mayor shall be the chief executive of the City of Fort Valley; he shall see that all laws, ordinances, resolutions, and rules of the city are faithfully executed and enforced, and that all officers of the city shall faithfully discharge their duties required of them. He shall have a general jurisdiction of the affairs of the city. He shall preside at all meetings of the mayor and city council of Fort Valley. He shall have the right to vote in the elections for officers, except as hereinafter provided, and upon all other questions before said body, except upon questions where he is disqualified by reason of interest, relationship, or otherwise.
Sec. 15. - Recorder's court.
(a)
Established; jurisdiction; presiding officer. There shall be a municipal court established for the City of Fort Valley, Georgia, known as the recorder's court, which shall have jurisdiction to try offenses against the laws and ordinances of the municipal government. Said court shall have power to enforce its judgments by inflicting such penalties as may be provided by the ordinances, punish witnesses for nonattendance, and also punish any person who shall counsel or advise; aid, encourage or intimidate a witness whose testimony is material or desired before said court, to absent himself, or to go away or remove beyond the reach of the processes of the court. Said court shall have full jurisdiction throughout the entire county of Houston [now Peach] and full power and authority for the purpose of compelling the attendance before said court, residing anywhere in said County of Houston [now Peach]. Such court shall be presided over by the recorder, or in his absence or disability or disqualification, by the mayor or the mayor pro tem, and said court shall be held at such times and as often as may be necessary to try all offenders against the city ordinances, the time of holding said court to be fixed by the presiding officer.
(b)
Maximum penalty; judicial power. The recorder or mayor or mayor pro tempore of said city shall have power to impose fines for the violation of any law or ordinance of the City of Fort Valley, to an amount not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or to imprison offenders in the city jail for a period of not more than thirty (30) days or to labor on the streets or public works in the city gang for not more than ninety (90) days. Either one or all of said sentences may be imposed, in the discretion of the presiding officer. He shall also have the same power as judges of the superior courts of the State of Georgia to punish for contempt by a fine not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) or imprisonment in the city jail not exceeding fifteen (15) days. He shall be to all intents and purposes a justice of the peace so far as to enable him to issue warrants for offenses committed within the corporate limits of the city, which warrants may be executed by any member of the police force of said city and to try and commit the offenders to the jail of Peach County or admit them to bail in bailable cases for their appearance at the next term of a court of competent jurisdiction to be held in and for said county.
