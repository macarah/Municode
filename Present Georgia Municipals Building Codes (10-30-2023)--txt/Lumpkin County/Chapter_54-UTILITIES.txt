Sec. 54-43. - Sewage and waste disposal; use of public water and sewer systems required.
(a)
Unlawful waste placement. It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the county or in any area under the jurisdiction of the county or the authority, any human or animal excrement, garbage, or other objectionable waste. It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the county, or in any area under the jurisdiction of the county or the authority, any sewage or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with this division. Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage.
(b)
Connection to public systems. In the interest of the public health, sanitation and general welfare, all buildings and structures located within the authority's service delivery area, of every nature, use and design, intended for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or for other purposes shall have a proper source of potable drinking water and sewage disposal. The owner of each house, building, or property used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or for other purposes is hereby required at the owner's expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect the facilities directly into the authority's wastewater system in accordance with the authority's regulations, if such connection is required by state law, to wit, the state's manual for on-site sewage management systems, section 290-5-26-.03 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 290-5-26-.03), which requires connection to public sewer when it is located within 200 feet of the owner's property or is located in a public right-of-way, road, or alley abutting the property.
(c)
No permit issuance. No permit for the construction of any residence, building or other facility which cannot be served by public sanitary sewer shall be issued, and no certificate for the use and occupancy for any existing residence, building or other facility which cannot be served by public sanitary sewer shall be issued, unless a septic tank or individual sewage management system permit has been issued by the board of health in conformity with any state-wide minimum standards for on-site sewage management systems and the regulations of the county board of health then in force and effect.
(d)
Connection upon failed system. Upon the failure of a septic tank or individual sewage management system, use of such system shall be discontinued. The property owner shall cause the building or structure to be connected to the public sanitary sewer system if such connection is required by state law, to wit, the state's manual for on-site sewage management systems, section 290-5-26-.03 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 290-5-26-.03), which requires connection to public sewer when it is located within 200 feet of the owner's property or is located in a public right-of-way, road, or alley abutting the property. Abandoned septic tanks and individual systems shall either be removed by the owner or filled with suitable material so as not to constitute a hazard or nuisance.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. I(4), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-44. - Separate building sewers required.
A separate building sewer shall be provided for every building and structure intended for human occupancy and accessible to the public sanitary sewer system, unless for good cause shown the director issues a written permit to allow more than one building or structure to be connected on a common building sewer.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. I(5), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-45. - Determination of wastewater volume.
Unless otherwise provided, the volume of wastewater delivered to the authority's wastewater system will be based upon the quantity of water purchased from, and metered by, the authority. If the volume of water delivered to the authority's wastewater system is greater or less than the volume purchased from the authority, the user shall make known to the authority such differences. If differences do exist, it shall be the obligation of the user to install authority-approved meters or other devices to determine the portion or quantity of wastewater delivered to the authority's wastewater system. At locations readily accessible for meter reading by the authority, separate water meters installed in the county right-of-way are preferred for measuring nonsewered consumptive water usage. The authority may consider establishing a constant ratio, factor or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the water system in order to determine the waste delivered by the user. Determining, as well as justifying, the factor to the authority will be the responsibility of the user. The value of this factor may be periodically reviewed for accuracy by the authority. Other methods may be established by the authority to estimate the quantity of wastewater released to the sanitary sewer which considers the amount of water consumed during different seasons. Users which claim wastewater volumes to be inaccurately determined by these methods shall bear the expense of installing authority-approved meters to estimate flows to the authority's wastewater system more accurately.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. I(6), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-46. - Regulation of waste received from other jurisdictions.

Sec. 54-99. - Significant industrial user permits.
(a)
Generally. All significant industrial users, as that term is defined in section 54-40, proposing to connect to the authority's wastewater system must obtain a permit ("SIU permit") before connecting to the authority's system. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subject the user to the sanctions set forth in this article. Obtaining a permit does not relieve a user of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or regulations. Prior or subsequent to the issuance of a permit, the user is required to submit to the authority revised plans whenever alterations or additions to the user's premises or operations vary from the original submitted application. The director may also initiate inquiries concerning revisions and process changes at six-month intervals.
(b)
Application process. All significant industrial users shall complete and file with the director an application for a permit consistent with the requirements for the application set forth in section 54-98(b), accompanied by any applicable application fee. Proposed new users shall make application not less than 90 days prior to their intended date of connection to the authority's wastewater system. The completed permit application for a general permit described in section 54-41 will serve as an application for a SIU permit.
(c)
Review and determination. The director will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require additional information. Within 60 days of receipt of a complete SIU permit application, the director will determine whether or not to issue a SIU permit. The director may deny any application for a SIU permit, in writing, stating the reasons for denial.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. III(2), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-100. - Significant industrial users.
All significant industrial users shall comply with the following, in addition to any permit requirements:
(1)
Sampling manhole. In order to provide for accurate sampling and measurement of industrial wastes, each significant industrial user shall provide and maintain, on each of its industrial waste outlet sewers, a monitoring station to be located outside the plant. If inside the plant fence, there shall be a gate near the sampling manhole with a key furnished to the authority. There shall be ample room provided in each monitoring station to enable convenient inspection and sampling by the authority or its agent. Also, a parshal flume or other approved flow measurement element and a 110-volt electrical outlet may be required to allow for composite sampling. In certain monitoring stations where noxious fumes may accumulate, the authority may require a fume exhaust system to protect the life and health of the authority employees who are required to enter the monitoring station. The fume exhaust system should extract the fumes from the bottom of the station and provide not less than one air change per minute.
(2)
Significant industrial user permit required. It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to fail to obtain a significant industrial user ("SIU") permit (as detailed in this section prior to connection to the authority's wastewater system.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. III(3), 9-15-2005)

(e)
Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change.
(1)
The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a new permit application according to the procedures set forth in this article.
(2)
The director may issue a permit under this article or modify an existing permit under this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(3)
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
(f)
Reports of potential problem, including slug loading.
(1)
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the authority's wastewater system, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the authority of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
(2)
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which may be incurred as a result of damage to the authority's wastewater system, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
(3)
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(g)
Reports from domestic users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require, in writing.
(h)
Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the authority monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the authority samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(i)
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the authority, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the authority's wastewater system of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the authority's wastewater system, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under the provisions of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this article.
(2)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(5)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(j)
Sampling and testing. All sampling and testing performed for reporting requirements shall be conducted in accordance with this article.
(k)
Submission date. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. III(5), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-103. - Sampling and testing procedures.
(a)
Sampling procedures.
(1)
Except as indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, hexavalent chromium, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab sample collection techniques.
(b)
Testing procedures.
(1)
All wastewater-monitoring samples required by the authority shall be tested by an independent laboratory for the parameters required, with the results submitted to the authority on the original laboratory report sheets. Copies will not be accepted and will constitute a rebuttable presumption that the test did not conform to standards.
(2)
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, or in accordance with any applicable EPA testing procedure of general acceptance in the chemical testing industry, provided, however, that all such analyses shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 136, which requirements shall prevail in the event of conflict.
(3)
The cost incurred for testing shall be the responsibility of the user.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. III(6), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-104. - Maintenance of records.
(a)
Sampling and testing records. Any permitted user subject to the reporting requirements and/or sampling requirements of this article shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required. Such records shall include for all samples:
(1)
The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and names of the person taking the samples;
(2)
The dates analyses were performed;
(3)
The name of the person who performed the analysis;
(4)
The analytical techniques/methods used; and
(5)
The results of such analyses.
(b)
Monitoring activities and records of results. Any permitted user subject to the reporting requirements established in this article shall be required to retain for a minimum of three years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring activities are required by this article) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the authority, state, or EPA. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the permitted user, or when requested by the authority, state, or EPA.

Sec. 54-105. - Industrial pretreatment facilities.
(a)
Requirements. All users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with the limitations and provisions contained in this article and to achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the authority shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans prepared by a registered professional engineer showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the authority for review and must be approved by the authority prior to commencement of construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user of the responsibility for modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the authority under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the authority prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
(b)
Compliance schedules. The timing of construction and operation of pretreatment facilities as required hereby shall be in accordance with the compliance schedules provided by the authority as described in this article; however, the authority shall also have the authority to issue compliance schedules independent of the permitting process and such compliance schedules may be enforced by the authority as provided in division 5 of this article, pertaining to enforcement and penalties.
(c)
Maintenance of pretreatment facilities. All wastewater pretreatment facilities shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the facilities.
(d)
Discharge during peak flow periods restricted. Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the authority's wastewater system and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
(e)
Storage and flow-control facility installed and maintained. The director may require any person discharging into the authority's wastewater system to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
(f)
Approved combustible gas detection meter installed and maintained. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

Sec. 54-127. - Sale of capacity.
The authority may sell capacity through purchase agreements at rates determined by the authority, and as the rates may be amended from time to time. The authority may also reserve capacity for future use through reservation agreements at rates determined by the authority, and as the rates may be amended from time to time. It is anticipated in the case of reservation agreements that a reservation fee would be paid up-front, with the actual purchase price of the capacity being paid at the time flow is intended to be discharged into the authority's wastewater system.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. IV(2), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-128. - Tap fees.
The authority may charge tap fees at a rate to be determined by the authority, and as the rates may be amended from time to time, for the actual connection of the user to the authority's wastewater system. The tap fee would be in addition to the fees paid for the purchase and/or reservation of capacity.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. IV(3), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-129. - High strength wastewater surcharge.
(a)
Establishment. Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the authority's wastewater system may be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required wastewater use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown in the table in this subsection. A high strength wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains the shown parameters in excess of the concentrations provided in the following schedule:
EXPAND
BOD 5 TSS Ammonia TKN Phosphorus
Design 250 mg/l 250 mg/l 20 mg/l 40 mg/l 6 mg/l
First level 500 mg/l 500 mg/l 30 mg/l 55 mg/l 10 mg/l
Second level 750 mg/l 750 mg/l 40 mg/l 70 mg/l 15 mg/l
Prohibited level 750 mg/l 750 mg/l 40 mg/l 70 mg/l 15 mg/l
  (b)
Surcharge basis. All persons discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer services charge, if these wastes have concentrations greater than the applicable treatment plant design loadings and are less than the prohibited levels. The amount of surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all persons discharging industrial wastewater into the public sewers, has been established by the water and sewerage authority as provided in the county fee schedule in section 18-19.
(c)
Determining persons liable for surcharge. The director or his designees shall determine which users are discharging waters or wastes to the authority's wastewater system in excess of acceptable levels. The surcharge rate shall be calculated using the following formula:
Monthly Surcharge Fee = (constituent mg/l constituent mg/l allowed) × 8.34 × average daily flow in 1,000,000 gallons per day × number of days in month × surcharge rate.
(d)
Quantitative measurement of surchargeable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD 5 , TSS, ammonia, and phosphorus) shall be conducted as follows:
(1)
Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the industrial user as specified in the user's permit, except that frequency of testing for surchargeable parameters shall be a minimum of two tests per month. If the permit requires more frequent testing, then the average of all test results will be used to calculate the surcharge. If the permit requires less frequent testing for compliance purposes, then testing frequency will be increased to twice per month.
(2)
The authority may sample the user as often as desired at the authority's expense. The authority will split the sample with the industrial user at the user's request.
(e)
Billing; payment of surcharge. The surcharge shall be assessed against each user on the basis of an arithmetic average of all tests conducted for each month and be billed monthly by the authority with the normal user charge, and the conditions for payment and penalties applicable to the normal user charge shall apply to the surcharge.

DIVISION 5. - ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES

Sec. 54-163. - Enforcement.
(a)
Generally. The failure of any person to comply with any provision contained in this article shall be a violation, which shall be enforced in accordance with the penalties and provisions as hereinafter set forth.
(b)
Inspections. The director shall have the right to direct and conduct such investigations as he may reasonably deem necessary to carry out the duties described in this article. For this purpose, the director and his designees, upon presentation of proper credentials, shall have the right to enter at reasonable times on any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the conditions relating to pollution and to inspect the operating records of any sewage system, waste treatment work, or other sewage disposal method. Unreasonable delays in allowing the director or his designees access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. Upon refusal of the right of entry, the director may apply to the magistrate court for an administrative search warrant, upon showing probable cause that a violation exists.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(1), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-164. - Notice of violation.
When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit or consent order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director shall serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without a notice of violation first being issued.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(2), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-165. - Consent orders.
The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified in the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as binding contracts under state law and shall be judicially enforceable by petition for specific performance.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(3), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-166. - Injunctive relief.
When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, or consent order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the county superior court, through the authority attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains the further violation and/or compels the specific performance of the permit, consent order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(4), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-167. - Termination of discharge.
(a)
Any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1)
Violation of permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article.
(b)
Such user shall be notified, in writing, of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered a reasonable opportunity to show cause before the director why the proposed action should not be taken. The decision of the director, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall be deemed a final action by the authority. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. Aggrieved users may seek judicial review by petitioning the superior court of the county for writ of certiorari.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(5), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-168. - Emergency suspensions.
(a)
The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after oral notice to the user, whenever, in the director's sole discretion, such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge that threatens to interfere with the operation of the authority's wastewater system, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the authority's wastewater system, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in this article are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of a termination hearing under this article.
(b)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(6), 9-15-2005)

(a)
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit or consent order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the authority for a maximum penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other longterm average discharge violation, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation, but shall not exceed $25,000.00 cumulatively. The director and/or his designee shall assess the penalty by issuing a notice of penalty in writing to the violator, which notice of penalty shall specify the amount of the penalty, the actions giving rise to the violation, and any other information relevant to the violation or correction thereof. A violator shall pay to the authority the assessed penalty within 30 days of the date of the notice of penalty. Failure of a violator to do so shall subject the violator to continuing penalties and other enforcement actions.
(b)
In addition to any monetary fine imposed, the director may seek restitution of reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the authority.
(c)
In determining the amount of penalty to be imposed, the director and/or his designee shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions voluntarily undertaken by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(d)
In lieu of the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the director may, in his sole discretion, elect to file a complaint for civil liability in the superior court, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 12-5-51.
(e)
A violation may appeal the notice of penalty to the authority by submitting a written notice of appeal to the director within ten days of the date of the notice of penalty. The decision of the authority shall be final.

Upon a complaint lodged with the authority, or upon a complaint generated by the authority itself, a citation may be issued by the sheriff's office or a duly authorized representative of the authority, requiring the person to appear before the judge of the magistrate court of the county on a day and time certain to answer for the violation. Except as otherwise allowed by law, any person guilty shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per offense, imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, or both.
(b)
Alternatively, the director may apply for a state warrant for violation of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53, returnable to the superior court.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(8), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-171. - Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the authority's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(9), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-172. - Notification delivery of enforcement actions.
Written notice personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail by certified mail to the person's last known address, as shown in authority utility billing records, shall be deemed sufficient notice for all enforcement actions in this article. Such notice may be personally served on the user or any authorized representative of the user. With respect to ordinance violations regarding nonpayment of amounts due under this article, only notice mailed to the person's last known address, by regular U.S. mail, of the amount owed and the date upon which payment is due shall be required.
(Res. No. 2005-55, art. V(10), 9-15-2005)
Sec. 54-173. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(b)
Permissible bypass. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section.
(c)
Procedures for approval of bypass.
(1)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2)
A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(d)
Prohibited bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
(1)
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
(2)
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(3)
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section.
(e)
Approval of anticipated bypass. The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d) of this section.

Sec. 54-201. - Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the authority's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as "trade secrets" under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted in writing at the time of submission of the information or data. To the extent allowed by law, when requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
