This election shall become a part of the permit and must be made at the time the initial building permit is requested. Any use of such ungraded or rough sawed lumber without such written election, except as may otherwise be permitted by the provisions of the code, shall be prima facie evidence of a code violation and shall be grounds for an automatic issuance of a stop work order. In such case after issuance of the stop work order a review by the building official shall be made within ten working days, and any review within such time period shall be considered a timely review. If, after review, the building official determines that such use was not elected at the time the initial application for a building permit was made, the nonconforming materials shall be removed and replaced by conforming materials.
