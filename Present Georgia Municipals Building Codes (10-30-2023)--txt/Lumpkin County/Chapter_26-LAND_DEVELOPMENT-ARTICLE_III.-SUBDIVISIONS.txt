ARTICLE III. - SUBDIVISIONS

Sec. 26-59. - Classes of subdivisions.
In order to promote the stated purpose of this chapter and the comprehensive plan, this chapter establishes the following classes of subdivisions:
(1)
Any other division of property that is not classified below will be considered a minor subdivide; allowing for one division of property per every two years, creating only one additional parcel/lot, and the residential lot size to be a minimum of 1.0 acre.
(2)
Any property involved in the minor subdivide cannot be further divided within the two year period.
(3)
Minor subdivide properties are the only division of property that is allowed off of an easement or private road.
(4)
Refer to the land use and land development regulations of this Code for additional restrictions on lot sizes within each character area and other requirements.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 200, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-60. - Class I subdivision.
A class I subdivision is the division of a tract of land into no more than three parcels (including the original tract) and no new road is required. Lot size must be a minimum of one acre in size and each lot must have a minimum of 30 feet frontage on, and direct access to, a public road (county or state road). Multiple class I subdivisions may not be chained together to avoid the regulations for a higher class subdivision. Any property involved in a class I subdivision may not be re-divided for two years. Property may not be divided using class I subdivision regulations on state routes without providing an approved DOT driveway permit. A class I subdivision on county roads will be required to submit sight distance information with their submittal.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 201, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-61. - Class II subdivision.
A class II subdivision is the division of a tract of land into no more than nine parcels where no new road is required. All lots must be a minimum of one acre in size and have frontage on a county road. A maximum of two flag lots are permitted in any class II subdivision. Multiple class II subdivisions may not be chained together or combined with Class I subdivision to avoid meeting the requirements for a higher class subdivision. No more than one Class II subdivision may be created from any tract of land without approval of the planning commission. Property may not be divided using class two subdivision regulations on state routes. A class II subdivision is prohibited on an easement or private road. Driveway locations and sight distance information must be shown on the plat. Combining or grouping of driveways is encouraged and may be required by the planning commission.
(Res. No. 2009-50, § 202, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-62. - Class III subdivision.
modified
A class III subdivision is the division of a tract of land into ten parcels or more and the creation of a new road. All lots must be a minimum of one acre and have frontage on a subdivision road that has direct access to a county road or state route. Class III subdivisions may not be accessed from a private road or an easement. All roads within a Class III subdivision must meet all of the requirements for a county road including, but not limited to right-of-way, pavement construction and width, required drainage and any other requirements that are currently in or that may be added to the policy for acceptance into the county road system. All lots within a class III subdivision must front on the newly created subdivision road and cannot front on or have direct access to a state route or county road. A maximum of two flag lots are permitted in any class III subdivision.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 203, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-63. - Class IV subdivision.
A class IV subdivision is a subdivision where the developer provides public water (or state approved water system) or a state approved sewer and treatment facility, or both to all of the lots. Twenty percent of the total acreage must be preserved as greenspace. The remainder (a maximum of 80 percent of the total tract acreage) may be developed with a minimum lot size of 25,500 square feet (0.585 acre). The maximum density for Class IV subdivisions will be one unit per gross acre. All class IV subdivisions must have curb and gutter. Flag lots are not allowed. As part of the preliminary plat submittal the developer must provide a tree survey identifying all specimen trees 24 inches or larger in diameter at average breast height within 75 feet of the centerline of the proposed road and demonstrate that the plans (road design, cut and fill areas, drainage patterns) are designed to preserve the maximum number of said trees. All specimen trees greater than 54 inches in diameter must be saved. Covenants that provide for protection of the greenspace areas must be presented to the planning commission. These covenants must be referenced in the final plat and recorded with the final plat. The covenants must indicate that each lot be given an undivided interest in the greenspace common areas. A subdivision street may divide a greenspace. The minimum tract size for a class IV designation is ten acres. The following statement will be placed on the final plat:
"Each lot of this subdivision will have an undivided interest in the greenspace common area."
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 204, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-64. - Class V subdivision.
(a)
This is a greenspace subdivision where the developer is required to provide a state approved public water and state approved sewer with treatment facility to all of the lots. The purpose of a greenspace subdivision is to allow development to be clustered in order to minimize disturbance, maximize greenspace and preserve the natural environment. This is a density-based subdivision with the overall density being one unit per gross acre. Minimum side setbacks are ten feet and rear setbacks are 20 feet. Flag lots are not allowed. The minimum lot size is one-eighth acre. All class V subdivisions must have curb and gutter, and must also provide sidewalks along one side of the street. A minimum of 40 percent of the total tract must be designated as greenspace and must be left as natural as possible, but the greenspace area may be used for passive recreation (hiking trails, etc.) Covenants that provide for protection of the greenspace areas must be presented to the planning commission. These covenants must be referenced in the final plat and recorded with the final plat. The covenants must indicate that each lot be given an undivided interest in the greenspace common areas. The following statement will be placed on the final plat:
"Each lot of this subdivision will have an undivided interest in the greenspace common area."
(b)
Where the developer desires to use recreation fields or a golf course as part of the green space calculations, the value for this area is calculated at the rate of 50 percent of the value of natural greenspace. Recreation or golf course greenspace may show ownership by a legal corporation. The minimum tract size for a class V designation is 20 acres. A class V (greenspace subdivision) must have a minimum building setback of 100 feet from the right-of-way of any existing state or county road with the first 50 feet being an undisturbed, supplemented or planted buffer. (This may be reduced by the planning commission for reason).
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 205, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-65. - Class VI subdivision.
This classification will be used for mixed use developments (commercial single-family and multifamily residential). The development must be designed for multiple uses. This classification allows the designers to propose to the planning commission a development that they believe will provide the best use of the land and will provide benefit the community as a whole. Multifamily may account for a maximum of 50 percent of the total acreage. The total number of multifamily units allowed must be based on the calculations in the multifamily regulations. The planning commission will review the first preliminary plan for the concept and make recommendations to the developer. The first preliminary must contain a boundary, conceptual site plan, topo (quad data ok) and general utility information. The second preliminary submittal must contain any recommendations from the planning commission, all of the normally required preliminary subdivision information, and a construction/completion schedule. The planning commission must review and approve the second preliminary prior to any development permits being issued. The planning commission has great leeway under the class VI designation. By approval of the preliminary and final plats they are also granting variances from any of the provisions of this regulation. This is done as part of the approval process if the planning commission has determined that the changes are necessary for a quality development and in the overall best interest of the community. The minimum size for a class VI is 20 acres. A class VI subdivision must have a mix of residential and commercial with a maximum of 50 percent of the total area devoted to multifamily and a maximum of 50 percent devoted to commercial.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 206, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-66. - Class VII subdivision.
This classification is for estate or farm subdivisions with a minimum lot size of three acres that require the construction of new roads. Within this class subdivision a maximum of 20 percent of the lots may be flag lots with the flagpole being a minimum width of 30 feet and a maximum length of 500 feet. The setbacks within a class VII subdivision are 50 feet from all property lines.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 207, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-67. - Class VIII subdivision.
This classification is for commercial development only. All class VIII subdivisions must have the following statement on the final plat:
"This subdivision was created for use as a commercial development. No residential use, including multifamily, will be allowed in this class VIII subdivision."
(Res. No. 2009-50, § 208, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-68. - Exemptions.
The following land subdivisions shall be defined as subdivisions but may be exempted from the requirements of these regulations if it is determined that one of the following criteria is met:
(1)
The combination or recombination of portions of previously approved platted lots where the total number of approved lots is not increased and the resultant lots meet the standards herein.
(2)
The division of land into no more than five parcels of five acres or more, with each lot having direct access to a county road. Any further subdivision of these tracts may only be approved by the planning commission.
(3)
The division of land by either a minor subdivide or a class I subdivision does not require planning commission approval, unless referred to the planning commission by the planning director because of special circumstances.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 209, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-69. - General subdivision requirements.
(a)
Any subdivision proposing to use public water must present a letter from the state, the county water authority or municipal water department indicating preliminary approval along with the preliminary plat. All water and/or sewer systems must have all required state and county approvals and be fully operational prior submittal of final plat for approval for recording.
(b)
Because of the severe topography, numerous waterways and potential for erosion, the grading of building lots and roadways at the same time (mass grading) is not permitted without special permission of the planning commission. Additionally, any slope greater (steeper) than a ratio of two units horizontal to one unit vertical (2:1) shall provide and construct a retaining feature. Any retaining feature greater than seven feet in height will require a design by a registered professional engineer.
(c)
All plats shall indicate the date of the most current FEMA's data: to include FIRM Panel numbers, zone boundary and designation, or wording to indicate that the property is not within FEMA's designated special flood hazard areas. Delineate all stream buffers, and if applicable, all building setbacks and other required buffers.
(d)
All construction and work debris shall be removed and disposed of properly by an appropriate method. Such disposal shall be completed before any permit is closed and final approval granted. Trees and stumps from land clearing operations may be ground and used as mulch on site.
(e)
Permanent traffic control devices shall be completely installed or constructed as per section 26-215(c) before the roadway is open to traffic.
(Res. No. 2002-44, 12-1-2002; Res. No. 2005-60, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2005-61, 10-21-2005; Res. No. 2007-44, 9-20-2007; Res. No. 2007-55, 11-15-2007; Res. No. 2009-50, § 210, 7-16-2009)
Sec. 26-70. - Residential subdivision requirements.
(a)
Definitions. The following are definitions and requirements for splitting parcels in a platted subdivision in the county:
Average area means the average area of all the platted lots in a subdivision will be initially determined from GIS and recorded survey data as determined by the planning director. More accurate data set out in a signed and recordable plat of survey may be considered.
Platted subdivision means any subdivision that was platted after the adoption of the county subdivision regulations on April 24, 1975, and recorded by the county clerk of courts.
Subdivision lots means a parcel of land in a platted subdivision that is less than three times the average area of all lots in the subdivision.
Subdivision tract means a parcel of land in a platted subdivision that is greater than three times the average area of all the platted lots in the subdivision.
(b)
All subdivision classes except I, III and VII require a roof pitch of no less than five vertical to 12 horizontal, with an overhang of no less than one foot exclusive of gutters.
(c)
All subdivision classes except I and VII require paved driveways from the edge of the existing paved road to the home or garage. (Classes I and VII require paving from the edge of the existing paved road to the right-of-way only.)
(d)
Subdivision classes IV, V, and VI allow on site construction only, conventional construction. No homes may be moved in.
(e)
All subdivision classes require adequate parking for a minimum of two vehicles on the lot and off of the right-of-way with, if possible, a turnaround area or other provisions to avoid backing vehicles into the street.
(f)
All subdivision classes except I and II require a landscaped entrance and all homes must front on and have their access to a subdivision street. (A ten-foot no-access easement strip shall be provided for all lots abutting along an existing county or state roads).
(g)
All subdivisions classes except I, II and V must have a minimum building setback from any existing state or county road right-of-way of 50 feet with the first 25 feet being an undisturbed, supplemented or planted buffer.
(h)
Class III, IV, V and VII subdivisions, planned developments and a minor subdivide may be designed with private roads, provided that the maintenance of these roads are covered under the covenants or deed of the property and approved by the planning commission.
(i)
Because of the severe topography, numerous waterways and rocky soil conditions any subdivision lots of less than one acre will, prior to the issuance of a building permit, be required to provide a level three soil analysis overlaid on the lot layout with topographical information. Every lot regardless of size must have a preliminary site plan showing the proposed house location, primary and secondary drainfield locations (drainfields must be shown in a suitable soil type), with location of driveways, and any other site amenities. This site plan must be submitted to the department of environmental health with the application for a septic permit. A copy must also accompany the building permit application.
(j)
All preliminary subdivision plats of more than 25 lots submitted for development on a county road which doesn't meet current county road requirements must be submitted with a registered professional engineer's traffic study. This study must show the current traffic volume, the increase in traffic volume from the development, and the traffic capacity of the road. If the proposed traffic volume exceeds the traffic capacity of the road, the developer may be required to improve the road, at his expense, to ensure that the capacity of the road is not exceeded by the proposed development.

(5)
No lot resulting from the splitting of a platted subdivision lot may have an area less than the average acreage of all subdivision lots in the platted subdivision. The average acreage of the subdivision lots will be the average of all lots at the adoption of regulation, or as existing at the time of the application, whichever is smaller.
(6)
Each lot resulting from the split must have a minimum of 30 linear feet of frontage on an existing or newly created subdivision road and be accessed from that frontage.
(7)
All lots or tracts which would result from a split must be approved by the county environmental health department.
(8)
No re-subdivide may result in a lot less than one acre.
(9)
The requirements of a class I, II, or III subdivision will have to be met as they pertain to the proposed subdivision tract split.
(10)
Any individual lot or homesite with a planned land disturbance within 200 feet of state waters must submit a detailed site plan with an erosion and sediment control plan prepared by a certified design professional along with the application for a building permit.
(11)
Subdivisions with more than 125 lots shall provide two separate entrances (access locations), when possible.
