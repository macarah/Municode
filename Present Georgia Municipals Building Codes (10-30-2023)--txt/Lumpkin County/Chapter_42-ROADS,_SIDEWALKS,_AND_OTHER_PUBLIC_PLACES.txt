Lumpkin County road sign regulations provide that:
(1)
Name signs of county roads shall be white letters on a green background.

Name signs of private roads are encouraged to be white letters on a blue background; name signs of private roads may not be of a green background with white letters.

Any person or persons desiring to place a sign on a road not adopted into the county road system may purchase a sign installation meeting county standards (sign, post and cap) from Lumpkin County; cost shall be prepaid and shall be in accordance with the fee schedules for signs in effect at the time the sign is ordered. The county will normally install the sign within one week of delivery from the manufacturer; however installation will be subject to weather and other department priorities. All sign installations shall be recorded by the county road department and locations maintained in the county GIS database.
(f)
Signs damaged or stolen after installation will not be replaced until the cost of the replacement has been paid to the county.

No order will be taken for future delivery which could result in county having to warehouse, store or protect goods for a period greater than 30 days after receipt of the signs and necessary installation materials.
