Statement of Ethics
Lumpkin County, Georgia
As representatives of Lumpkin County, we subscribe to the following:
I.
Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to Country, State, and County above loyalty to persons, party, or government department.
II.
Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and of all governments therein, and never be a party to their evasion.
III.
Uphold the Lumpkin County Code of Ethics.
IV.
Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for renumeration or not, and never accept, for myself or my family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of my governmental duties.
V.
Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a government official has no private word which can be binding on public duty.
VI.
Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of my governmental duties.
VII.
Never use any information coming to me confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.
VIII.
Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.
AGREED TO, this ___ day of 20___.
