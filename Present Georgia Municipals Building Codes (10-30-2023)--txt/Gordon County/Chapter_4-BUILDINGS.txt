Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reasons for refusal.
(e)
Conditions of the permit.
(1)
Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of this article, nor shall such issuance of a permit prevent the fire safety inspector from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans or in construction, or of violations of this article. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the use authorized by such permit is commenced within six (6) months after its issuance, or if the use authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the time the use is commenced.

DIVISION 4. - MANUFACTURED HOMES

Sec. 4-61. - Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the requirements for manufactured homes within the county. These requirements shall be followed in addition to those included in the technical codes.
(b)
Definition. Manufactured home shall be defined as a structure transportable in one (1) or more sections and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling, with or without a permanent foundation, when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and the electrical systems contained thereon.
(c)
Construction requirements. All manufactured homes placed in the county shall be constructed in conformity with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provided however, the requirements of this section shall not apply to any manufactured home located in the county as of February 21, 1989, and on which there is located a current county tax sticker which was purchased prior to February 21, 1989, as reflected by the tax sticker purchase records of the tax digest on file in the office of the tax commissioner of the county.
(1)
Should any manufactured home exempted by subsection (c) above be moved from the location of said home after April 12, 1992, to another location in the county, the owner shall apply for a moving permit from the building inspector. Before issuing a moving permit, the building inspector shall inspect said home to determine if the manufactured home meets the electrical wiring standards as set forth in the National Electrical Code. In addition, the manufactured home must also meet the standards set forth in the Standard Housing Code. Should the manufactured home fail to meet the wiring standards or the Standard Housing Code, no moving permit shall be issued nor shall a permit for permanent utilities be issued until the manufactured home is brought into compliance with the National Electrical Code and the Standard Housing Code.
(2)
It shall be the responsibility of the owner of a pre-HUD manufactured home to show proof that the manufactured home has been located in the county prior to February 21, 1989. Such proof shall consist of documentation from the office of the tax commissioner of the county that all taxes were paid during each year as the said taxes became due. If the owner is not able to establish that taxes have been paid on a yearly basis for a pre-HUD manufactured home, then that pre-HUD home shall not be allowed to be relocated and a mobile home permit shall not be issued. In addition, it shall be the responsibility of the owner to provide a certificate of ownership (title) which corresponds with the manufacturer's serial number stamped into the frame of the manufactured home.
(3)
Only manufactured homes which have been approved by the department of housing and urban development may be allowed to be moved into the county, conditioned upon the inspection by and approval of the county building inspector.
(4)
Any manufactured home, whether on an individual lot or in a manufactured home park/subdivision, shall be required to be skirted/underpinned at the time of installation.
The underpinning shall consist of one (1) of the following: masonry, vinyl siding/panels or aluminum siding/panels or such other material as may be approved by the building inspector prior to installation.
The following types of materials are not permitted to be used, including but not limited to, tin, wood (unless of natural decay-resistant types such as cedar), plastic sheeting or gypsum board (black board).
The underpinning must be adequately secured to the manufactured house and, where necessary for stability, secured to the ground. Two (2) access doors are required to be installed in a manner which will provide adequate access for inspections and maintenance. Provisions must be made for adequate ventilation for the crawl space underneath the manufactured house.
(d)
All manufactured homes placed in the county shall be installed so as to at least comply with Appendix H of the Standard Building Code. The installation of tiedowns and ground anchors may vary from model to model and may comply with manufacturer's specifications where said specifications exist.
(e)
Permanent additions may be built onto or become a part of any manufactured home unit and may include porches, carports, decks, and additional living space prescribed by the technical codes and with proper permits. However, in no case shall one (1) or more manufactured homes be attached to an existing manufactured home as a temporary or permanent addition.
(f)
All manufactured home installations shall provide an adequate means of entry (steps) at every door opening. In addition, all exterior doors shall be provided with a minimum three-foot by three-foot landing. Any porch or deck located thirty (30) inches or greater above the ground shall be provided with guardrails and handrails as indicated in the CABO One- and Two-Family Dwelling Code. Steps higher than three (3) risers shall be provided with handrails.
(g)
Electric service equipment (meter base and outside service disconnect switch) may be permanently attached to a manufactured home only when the home has a permanent masonry foundation.
(h)
Each owner of a manufactured home located in the county shall obtain, at the time of purchase and each year thereafter that said home is located in the county, between January 1 and April 1, a county location decal (county tax sticker). Said decal shall be purchased from the tax commissioner of the county. No person shall be entitled to purchase a decal until he/she presents to the tax commissioner a certificate of title or other proof of his/her ownership. Failure to obtain a decal each year shall constitute a violation of this article.
(i)
Any manufactured home which is damaged beyond repair, as determined by the building inspector, fire inspector and/or the nuisance officer of the county, by fire, natural disaster or man-made disaster, shall be removed and disposed of by the owner within ninety (90) days after said damage occurred. An extension of time not to exceed an additional ninety (90) days may be approved by the building inspector upon a showing of good cause for such extension. Any such dwelling not removed and disposed of during such time shall constitute a nuisance per se.
(j)
No manufactured home may be occupied and no permit for the installation of utilities may be issued until such time as:
(1)
The environmental health department has certified that such manufactured home is served by public sewer and has been connected to such public sewer; or
(2)
The building inspector receives from the environmental health department a certificate indicating that any septic tank system installed to serve such housing has been installed in conformity with health regulations promulgated by the environmental health department and that said septic tank system is then operating properly.
(k)
No manufactured home shall be used for any purpose other than as a dwelling unit, except in commercial applications when the unit has been specifically manufactured for that commercial purpose (i.e., office trailer on construction site).

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 4-251. - Authorization.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county board of commissioners of Gordon County, Georgia, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. of 8-19-08, art. 1, § A)
Sec. 4-252. - Findings of fact.
(1)
The flood hazard areas of Gordon County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. of 8-19-08, art. 1, § B)
Sec. 4-253. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. of 8-19-08, art. 1, § C)
Sec. 4-254. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
(4)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(6)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and;
(7)
To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(b)
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the director of building inspections in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the county planning commission may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the county planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and;;
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The director of building inspections shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the county planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Sec. 4-354. - Posting of designated structure numbers.
(a)
The owner or occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned shall be notified in writing by the implementing agency of the number assigned to the same at any time after adoption of this article.
(b)
Within sixty (60) days after receipt of such written notification, the owner, occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned shall cause the same to be posted in either one (1) or two (2) locations depending upon the following conditions:
(1)
If the mailbox is located on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number shall be affixed to the mailbox in letters two (2) inches in height or larger and of a color contrasting with the color of the mailbox. This section does not preclude an individual from also numbering the front entrance of the structure if so desired.
(2)
If the mailbox is not on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number shall be posted at two (2) locations:
a.
On the mailbox as prescribed by U.S. Postal Service regulations; and
b.
Either on the structure front if visible from the street or on an aboveground sign attached to a post or other object at the driveway or curb cut. The numbers shall be two (2) inches in height or larger and of a color contrasting with the color of the background. This section does not preclude an individual from also numbering the front entrance of his structure if so desired.
(3)
In the case that a building is served by two (2) or more driveways or curb cuts, the number shall be assigned and posted to the front entrance or driveway.
(4)
It shall be the duty of the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling unit, structure or use, upon affixing the new number, to remove any different number which might be mistaken for or confused with the number assigned to the structure.
(5)
In such cases where the assigned number cannot be posted as required above, the number shall be posted as prescribed by the emergency management director after consultation with the owner.
(Ord. of 2-4-92, Art. IV)
Sec. 4-355. - Types of numbers.
(a)
Two (2) types of numbers are used under this article:
(1)
A primary number to be assigned to each street frontage of each parcel of land, whether or not the parcel is occupied. The primary number is required to be posted only if the parcel occupied by a dwelling unit, structure or active use and the owner, occupant or person in charge is notified under section 4-354 of this article. Other primary numbers are reserved for future development of the numbered parcels and will be assigned at the time of development.
(2)
Secondary numbers may be used when a number of units, structures and uses coexist on the same parcel of land. Examples of parcels requiring secondary numbers include apartment projects, condominium projects, mobile home parks, office parks, planned unit developments, recreational vehicle parks, recreational areas, shopping centers and other uses where the use of secondary numbers would clarify the location of a unit or use for public safety purposes. To provide secondary numbers, the emergency management director shall work with the owner, manager, or person in charge of the project to determine a logical numbering system under the following guidelines:
a.
Existing numbered units and uses shall retain the present set of addresses with only the primary number being changed if the primary number is not in sequence with the overall system.
b.
Buildings on a single parcel with more than one (1) and less than five (5) units may be given a number designation as requested by the owner.
c.
A single building on a single parcel of land and with five (5) or more units may be given numerical designations such as Suite 5, Apartment 5, etc., if so desired.
d.
Multiple buildings on the same parcel of land may be given secondary numbers consisting of number designations if the buildings are accessed from a main entrance to the project. Generally the number designations should increase in a clockwise direction from the main entrance.
e.
Mobile home parks, recreational vehicle parks and similar uses shall be given number designations for lots or sections and number designations for individual lots or sites.
(Ord. of 2-4-92, Art. V)
Sec. 4-356. - Implementation in stages.
(a)
Because of the large and complex nature of the county and the existing numbering system now in place in some portions of the unincorporated county, this article shall be implemented in stages covering small sections of the entire area by the adoption of implementation resolutions for each section of the county.
(b)
It shall be the policy of the county not to change existing numbered addresses if the existing system follows a logical and expandable order.
(Ord. of 2-4-92, Art. VI)
Sec. 4-357. - Exempt and excluded structures.
(a)
The intent of this section is to exclude from this article those structures that do not present a significant danger to human life if destroyed by fire or other events.
(b)
The following structures shall be excluded from the provisions:
(1)
Agricultural buildings not requiring a separate mailing address such as a barn, poultry house, outbuilding or equipment storage buildings. Buildings used as dwelling units, offices or the normal work station of an employee shall not be exempt.
(2)
Storage and accessory buildings for the use of the occupant of another building on the property. Buildings used as dwelling units, offices, or the normal work station of an employee, or requiring a separate mailing address, shall be exempt.
(Ord. of 2-4-92, Art. VII)
Sec. 4-358. - New structure and lots.
(a)
Structure numbers will be assigned to each new lot, tract or building site on the original drawings of a final subdivision plat, mobile home park plan, planned unit development or other plan requiring the approval of the county building inspector or by the zoning department.
(b)
No building, electrical, plumbing or mechanical permit for any new or remodeled or repaired structure will be issued by the building inspector of the county following the implementation of this article in the affected area of the county until the owner, developer or builder has procured from the emergency management director the official structure number or numbers. Final approval for a certificate of occupancy of any principal building erected or repaired, or use requiring such number, shall be withheld until permanent and proper numbers have been displayed in accordance with the standards of this article.
(Ord. of 2-4-92, Art. VIII)
Sec. 4-359. - Utility company compliance.
Following the implementation of this article in any area of the county, all utility services regulated by the Georgia Public Service Commission or any utility cooperative service organization shall withhold service from any building until the owner or other requesting party has furnished the utility with a valid structure number.
(Ord. of 2-4-92, Art. IX)
