ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 10-1. - County personnel system.
The Gordon County Personnel Policies create a system of employment which recognizes that the county employees covered by the system should be selected and promoted according to their skills, knowledge and abilities, and that employees who perform satisfactorily should be retained in their positions as long as the positions exist and regardless of factors not associated with their performance and conduct compatible with the trust inherent in public service, the administrative necessity for the position held, availability of funds and organizational needs of the government unit.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. 1, § A)
Sec. 10-2. - Establishment.
These policies have been established by the Gordon County Board of Commissioners, hereinafter referred to as the "board." The board and participating elected officials have included specified employees under their administration in the system. This action was taken to provide a fair, equitable, and productive work environment. The system and these policies have been enabled by the signatures of the participating elected officials and by an ordinance adopted by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. 1, § B)
Sec. 10-3. - Purpose.
These policies have been adopted to provide for the recruitment and development of the best available employee for each position in the service of the county. They provide for the establishment of orderly procedures for administering the following principles:
(1)
Recruiting, selecting and advancing employees on the basis of their relative ability, knowledge and skills, including open competition of qualified applicants for initial appointment.
(2)
Establishing pay rates consistent with the principle of providing comparable pay for comparable work.
(3)
Training employees, as needed, to assure high-quality performance.
(4)
Retraining employees on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, correcting inadequate performance, and separating employees from the work force whose inadequate performance cannot be corrected.
(5)
Assuring equal employment opportunity through the fair treatment of applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to political affiliation, race, color, creed, national origin or ancestry, disability, sex, or religion and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights as citizens.
(6)
Assuring that employees are protected against coercion for partisan political purposes and are prohibited from using their official authority for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the results of an election or a nomination for office.
(7)
Establishing uniform benefits and personnel procedures where applicable.
(8)
Complying with applicable federal and state laws.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. 1, § C)

Sec. 10-4. - Positions covered.
These policies apply to the career service positions in all departments under the administration of the board and of the participating elected officials, including those employees whose positions are subsidized from federal, state or other sources. The following are the exceptions:
(1)
Federal equal employment law recognizes that neither elected officials nor members of their personal staffs should be covered by legislation creating full-time positions, and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-21 exempts elected officials or persons appointed to positions for specified terms from civil service coverage. Therefore, the board and the participating elected officials will determine which positions in the county are policy-making, personal staff, or appointments for specified terms, and shall exclude these positions from coverage under these policies. All other full-time and part-time positions that are included in the classification plan are covered.
(2)
Employees of other agencies partially funded by the county and employees of departments jointly funded by the county and municipalities and/or organizations located within the geographic boundaries of the county.
(3)

(4)
Employees who have been employed by the county for less than six (6) months or who are on an extended initial working test period.
(5)
Part-time or temporary positions unless specifically covered by action of the board.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. 1, § D)
Sec. 10-5. - Administration and enforcement.
The county administrator, as the chief executive officer of the county, with the cooperation of the participating elected officials, is responsible for administering and maintaining these policies. The daily implementation and routine administrative duties associated with the system and the policies may be delegated to the human resources director.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. 1, § E)
Cross reference— Administration, Ch. 2.
Sec. 10-6. - Policy changes.
The board reserves the right to change or amend these policies at any time, by resolution, if the change does not adversely affect the property interests of the employees. Proposed changes will be provided to participating elected officials for their review, comment, and approval.

(e)
Rejection of applications. The human resources director may reject an application which indicates that the applicant is deficient in any or all of the requirements as specified in the public announcement of the vacancy. An application may also be rejected for the practice, or attempted practice, of fraud or deception in the completion of his application or if his past record of employment is determined by the human resources director to be unsatisfactory. Notice of rejection, stating the reason therefor, shall be mailed to the rejected applicant by the human resources director.

Such process may include, but not be limited to, ratings of training and experience, written, oral, physical, or performance tests, or any combination of these as determined by the human resources director. The process may take into consideration such factors as education, experience, knowledge, skill, physical fitness, or any other bona fide occupational qualifications which are job-related and which, in the judgment of the human resources director, enter into the determination of the relative suitability of applicants. The human resources director may require the applicant to submit proof of his education, military service, or any other such documentation as he/she deems necessary. All qualifications and tests shall be job-related and shall be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner.

(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. 3; Ord. of 9-2-03, § 1)
Sec. 10-28. - Working test period.
(a)
Objective. The working test period shall be regarded as an integral part of the selection process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's work, for securing the most effective adjustment of a new employee to his position, and for rejecting any employee whose performance is not satisfactory.
(b)
Duration. The working test period shall be six (6) months in duration.
(c)
Promotional appointments. The working test period shall be used in connection with promotional appointments in the same manner as it is used for original entrance appointments.

(d)
Interruption of working test. If an employee is laid off during a working test period, and his services have been satisfactory and he is subsequently reemployed in the same department, he shall be given credit for the portion of the working test period completed before he was laid off.
(e)
Dismissal during working test. During the working test period, an employee may be terminated for the following reasons:
(1)
At any time during the working test period, the department head may remove an employee if, in the department head's opinion, the working test period indicates that such employee is unable or unwilling to perform the duties of the position satisfactorily, or that his habits and the lack of dependability do not merit his continuance with the service, or for causes which would subject a regular employee to disciplinary action. A report in writing shall be sent to the human resources director within three (3) days after the effective date of the dismissal.
(2)
An employee found to have been appointed through fraud shall be removed within ten (10) calendar days of notification of the department head to this effect.

(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. 4)
Sec. 10-29. - Promotions, transfers and demotions.
(a)
Policy. Vacancies in higher positions in the career service shall be filled, as far as practicable, by promotion from lower classes. To accomplish this purpose, closed examinations may be held. When the county administrator and the human resources director determine that there is a sufficient number of well-qualified eligibles within the service, they may direct that a closed competition be held.
(b)
Political or partisan endorsement prohibited. No consideration shall be given to political or partisan endorsement for promotions to positions in the classified service; only merit and fitness for promotion shall be considered.
(c)
Promotional examinations. The human resources director, working in conjunction with appointed department heads, elected officials and/or judicial officials, shall conduct promotional examinations in accordance with these regulations. In promotional examinations, the human resources director shall admit to the process all employees who meet the published qualification requirements.

(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. V)
Sec. 10-30. - Employee performance evaluation.
(a)
Objective. The county administrator shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a job-related system for evaluating the work performance of all employees in the career service. The purpose of the employee performance evaluation shall be primarily to inform employees how well they are performing their work and how they can improve their work performance. The performance evaluation may also be used in determining order of layoff, as a basis for training, promotion, demotion, transfer, or dismissal, and for such other purposes as set forth in these regulations.
(b)
Period of evaluation. On original appointment, or on promotions, all employees, except temporary workers, shall be evaluated in writing by the supervisor, and a recommendation shall be made within twenty (20) days of the end of their working test period and semiannually thereafter. An employee shall not be eligible for a pay raise until the performance evaluation form has been completely processed. Employees shall also be evaluated at the time of separation.
(c)
Evaluation. Evaluations shall be prepared by the immediate supervisor of each employee and reviewed by the department head. An employee in a supervisory position, who is leaving the position, may be required to submit performance evaluation forms on all the employees under his supervision who have not been evaluated within the previous six-month period.
(d)
Review with employees. The evaluator shall discuss each performance evaluation with the employee being evaluated.

The employee shall also be notified if a change is made in the evaluation.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. VI)
Sec. 10-31. - Disciplinary action.
(a)
Intent. It is the intent of the county that effective supervision and employee relations will avoid most matters which necessitate disciplinary action. These rules, and disciplinary action for violation of such rules, are not intended to restrict the rights of anyone, but to insure the rights of all and to secure cooperation and orderliness throughout the career service. The severity of disciplinary action should be related to the gravity of the offense, the employee's record of disciplinary action, the employee's length of service, and the county's practice in similar cases.
The department head and the human resources director shall make every effort to insure that all employees understand their duties and are aware of the rules and standards that apply to them. Every effort shall also be made to consistently enforce rules and standards. Fairness, promptness, and legal sufficiency shall govern the disciplinary process.
In applying these guidelines for disciplinary actions, the concept of "progressive discipline" shall be followed. "Progressive discipline" is defined as meaning that when disciplinary actions are necessary, they are gradually increased and applied in terms of ascending severity. Each action is intended to correct unacceptable behavior. With progressive discipline, employees shall be given an opportunity to correct their behavior before a more severe action is applied. The objective is to apply the least severe action which will improve the employee's performance to an acceptable level.
(b)
Types of disciplinary action. The forms of discipline to be utilized by the county, when deemed necessary, are as follows:
(1)
Employee counseling (oral reprimand). When an employee does not comply with the rules and standards of his position, the department head may counsel orally with the employee in order to clearly define areas of deficient job performance and steps needed for improvement, depending upon the severity of the deficiency. (A written record of the oral reprimand should be maintained by the immediate supervisor.)
(2)
Written reprimand. A department head may submit a written reprimand to an employee when oral warnings prove ineffective or when severe initial action is required. A copy shall be filed in the employee's personnel file. Included in the letter shall be a statement of the employee's right to appeal and appeal procedures. Two (2) reprimands within a twelve-month period for similar offenses may be grounds for dismissal.
(3)
Suspension. A department head may, for disciplinary purposes, suspend without pay any employee in his department for a length of time that he considers appropriate, not to exceed ten (10) working days. However, the department head has the option of making an accumulated leave in lieu of suspending him without pay, and the department head may apply this equivalent deduction to all or part of the employee's suspension time. A written statement, specifically setting forth reasons for such suspension, shall be furnished to the affected employee by his department head, at the time of the suspension, and a copy filed with the human resources director. With the approval of the county administrator, an employee may be suspended for a longer period, pending the investigation or trial of criminal charges against him. However, the filing of criminal charges against an employee shall be evaluated to determine if there is a negative impact upon the county of sufficient magnitude to justify suspension. The fact that a person is acquitted of the charges or that the charges are dropped does not necessarily mean that the suspension or other disciplinary action will be revoked.
(4)
Demotion. With the prior approval of the county administrator, a department head may reduce the salary of an employee or demote the employee, for cause. A written statement of the reasons for any such action shall be furnished to the affected employee, by his department head, on or before the effective date of the action, and a copy filed with the human resources director.
(5)
Dismissals. Dismissals are separations made for delinquency, misconduct, inefficiency, inability to perform the work of the position satisfactorily, or conduct which seriously jeopardizes the health, welfare or safety of the county, its employees or the general public.
(c)
Progressive discipline. The essential elements and responsibilities of progressive discipline are as follows:
(1)
Department heads and employees shall be mutually responsible that all employees understand their assigned duties, rules, regulations, policies, and procedures which are applicable.
(2)
Department heads shall be responsible for prompt and consistent enforcement of all applicable rules, regulations, policies, and procedures which are applicable.
(3)
Department heads and employees shall be mutually responsible for understanding and following the principles of good employee relations.
(4)
Department heads shall be responsible for proper documentation of all disciplinary actions taken.
(d)
Reasons for disciplinary action. Listed below are some of the reasons which could be cause for disciplinary action referred to in subsection (a) above, but disciplinary action is not limited to the offenses listed:
(1)
Being convicted of a crime for which a prison sentence is imposed.
(2)
Too much lost time.
(3)
Being absent without leave.
(4)
Excessive tardiness or unapproved absences from work.
(5)
Inefficiency.
(6)
Abuse of county property.
(7)
Willfully giving false statements to supervisors, officials, the public, or the board of commissioners.

(11)
Acceptance of gratuities in conflict with the policy outlined in section 10-33 of this chapter.
(12)

(17)
Failure to perform the duties and responsibilities of his/her position at an acceptable level of competence.
(e)
Dismissal, suspension, or demotion of department heads. The county administrator has the authority to dismiss, suspend, or demote a department head for cause in accordance with the guidelines outlined in subsection (b) of this section.
(f)
Notice of disciplinary action. In all cases, the immediate supervisor shall notify the employee of the action taken and a copy of such notice will be retained in the employee's personnel file except in the case of a verbal reprimand.
(g)
Appeal rights. A regular employee who is dismissed, suspended, or demoted shall be given written specific reasons for the action and advised of appeal rights in accordance with this section.
(1)
Within five (5) work days of receipt of the written reasons for the action, the employee may counsel with the county administrator or his designee about the action. This meeting shall not include a representative of the employee nor other management representatives.
(2)
The county administrator or his designee, or where applicable, the elected official or judicial official, shall give the employee a written response within five (5) work days of the meeting with the employee. This response will advise the employee of his rights to appeal to the board of commissioners. In the case of an employee working under the direction of an elected official or a judicial official, the right to appeal shall be with the appropriate elected official or a judicial official. Following that appeal to the appropriate elected official or judicial official, any further appeals shall be to the appropriate court of law with jurisdiction of the matter.
(3)
A request for a hearing before the board of commissioners shall be submitted in writing to the county administrator or his designee within five (5) work days of receipt of the county administrator's response to the employee.
(4)
The county administrator or his designee shall schedule the hearing as soon as practical after receipt of the request, but within fifteen (15) work days.
(5)
The purpose of the hearing is for presentation of factual reasons for the action taken and for the employee to rebut these reasons and/or to show that the action taken was not justified. Either party may be represented by an attorney or other persons, but formal rules of evidence shall not be required.
(6)
The chairman of the board of commissioners shall exercise full authority to restrict or prohibit testimony that is irrelevant to the original written reasons for the disciplinary action.
(7)
The decision of the board of commissioners shall be by majority vote, taken in executive session, after the close of the hearing. Such decision shall be final.
(8)
Either side may, at its own expense, provide for a written record of this hearing. The county administrator or his designee shall in any event provide stenographic assistance to record time and place of meeting, persons present and presenting testimony, the decision of the board of commissioners, and a written response to the employee within five (5) work days.
(9)
The intent of time limits provided in this section is to provide for an expeditious settlement of appeals. A violation of these limits shall not prejudice the position of either party after a showing of reasonable cause for being unable to conform to the time limit.
(10)
It shall be a violation of this policy for any member of county government to interfere, in any way, with disciplinary actions except following written appeals as provided herein.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. VII)
Sec. 10-32. - Separations.
(a)
Resignation. To resign in good standing, an employee must, in writing, give his department head at least fourteen (14) calendar days notice. Normally, failure to comply with this rule shall be entered on the service record of the employee and may result in a denial of reemployment rights. However, the department head, with the approval of the county administrator, may exempt from this penalty an employee who has given less than the required notice when exceptional circumstances warrant such exemption.
All notices are final when accepted. Any employee who resigns and then wishes to return to work for the county shall be required to complete an application and must follow the same procedures as other applicants who are applying for the position under open, competitive appointments.
(b)
Abandonment of position. An employee who, without valid reason, fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive days without authorized leave shall be separated from the payroll and reported as having abandoned his position. Such an employee is not eligible for reemployment.
(c)
Layoffs. Any involuntary separation not involving delinquency, misconduct, inefficiency, or safety shall be considered a layoff.
(1)
When, for any reason, it becomes necessary to reduce the working force in a department, regular employees shall be laid off on the basis of the following factors to be weighed equally:
a.
Length of service in class.
b.
Length of service with the county.
c.
Average of performance ratings for the last three (3) years.
(2)
When a department head believes that a certain individual is essential to the efficient operation of the department or organizational unit, because the individual possesses special skills or abilities and the department head wishes to retain this individual in preference to a person with a higher rating as provided above, the department head shall submit a written request to the county administrator for permission to do so. This request shall set forth, in detail, the specific skills and abilities possessed by the individual and the reasons why such individual is essential to the effective operation of the department. With the approval of the county administrator, the individual may be retained.
(3)
If a regular employee is scheduled to be laid off, he may be offered a demotion to a lower class, if a vacancy exists and if he is qualified to fill positions in the lower class involved.
(4)
Prior to a reduction in force, the names and job titles of all regular employees scheduled for layoff shall be submitted to the county administrator for approval, and until he has approved and confirmed the names submitted for layoff, no layoff shall be consummated.
(5)
Regular employees to be laid off shall be notified, in writing, by the county administrator or his designee at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff.
(6)
There shall be no appeal of separation by layoff, but the regular employee shall have the right of appeal if he believes these procedures have been improperly used.
(d)
Disability. The county will comply with all state and federal statutes and regulations relating to the treatment of persons with disabilities. A department head may direct any employee under his jurisdiction to be examined by a physician designated by the county, and/or to provide a medical release for any existing pertinent medical records if the department head reasonably suspects that the employee is not able to perform the essential functions of the job. When a disability is discovered which impairs the effectiveness of a regular employee's job performance, or which makes their continuance on the job a danger to themselves or to others, the following action shall be taken:
(1)
If the disability is correctable, the employee shall be allowed a specified time, as determined by the physician, to have it corrected. If they fail to take steps to have the disability corrected within this specified time, the employee shall be subject to disciplinary action or layoff.
(2)
If, in the opinion of the examining physician, the disability cannot be corrected, the department head, subject to the approval of the county administrator, shall: Make reasonable accommodations to assist the employee to perform job duties. If reasonable accommodations cannot be made, the department head shall: Attempt to place the employee in another position which the employee can perform satisfactorily. If that cannot be accomplished successfully, the department head shall: Take steps to separate the employee from the county's service through retirement or layoff.
(e)
Loss of job eligibility. Any employee who is unable to do their job adequately, because of loss of a necessary license or other requirement, shall be separated by a layoff.
(f)
Dismissals. See section 10-31.
(g)
Death. When a regular employee dies while in the service of the county, their estate shall be eligible to receive payment for their earned salary and accumulated annual leave.

Only that information which is required by federal and state law to be made available to the general public shall be released in cases when written request for such information is made to the human resources director. In all such cases, the employee shall be notified by the human resources director that a request to review information contained in the personnel records of the employee has been received.

(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. IX)
Sec. 10-34. - Attendance and leave.
(a)
Hours of work. The established work week and the hours of work shall, insofar as practicable, be uniform and shall be determined in accordance with the needs of the county and the reasonable needs of the public who may be required to do business with various county departments and with due regard to time commitments of staff outside usual office hours. The work schedule for each department shall be established by the department head with the approval of the county administrator.

An employee who is not on approved leave, and fails to report on his or her scheduled work day before or after a holiday, shall not be paid for the holiday. Holidays which occur during annual or sick leave shall not be charged against annual or sick leave. An employee who is required to work on a designated holiday will be afforded a day off in lieu of the holiday, to be taken within the next two (2) pay periods, and shall not accumulate compensatory time.
(e)
Annual (vacation) leave. Vacations are for the purpose of rejuvenating both physical and mental faculties, and all employees are urged to avail themselves of vacation periods. The following rules shall apply to annual (vacation) leave:
(1)
No employee shall receive pay, in lieu of vacation, unless recommendation is made by the county administrator and specific approval is given by the board.
(2)
All full-time employees shall be entitled to earn and accrue annual (vacation) leave. Part-time and temporary employees shall not be eligible for annual leave.
(3)
Full-time employees begin to accrue annual leave immediately upon employment. Employees under temporary appointment or provisional appointment, and employees not deemed to be in the career service, will not be granted annual leave under these policies. An employee in pay status for a full pay period during a calendar month earns annual leave for that month.
(4)
Annual leave is accrued at the following rate:
a.
One-half day per month for employees with 0—3 years of service;
b.
One (1) day per month for employees with 4—9 years of service;
c.
One and one-half days per month with 10 plus years of service.
(5)
An employee reemployed, after a break in service, shall not receive annual accrual credits for previous service.
(6)
A request for annual leave shall be submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor. Leave may be taken only after approval by the appropriate department head, so that, insofar as practicable, the department can function without the hiring of additional help.
(7)
Unused annual leave, not to exceed thirty (30) days, may be carried into the next fiscal year. It is the intent of these rules to have employees take their annual leave yearly.
(8)
When an employee is separated from service, he shall be paid for unused annual leave of up to maximum accrual.
(f)
Sick leave. Sick leave shall be granted to an eligible employee for the following reasons:
(1)
In the case of actual sickness or disability of the employee or for medical, dental, or eye examinations, maternity leave, or treatment for which arrangements cannot be made outside of working hours.
(2)
When the employee is required to care for a sick or injured spouse, child, or parent or guardian. Sick leave also shall be granted when the employee is required to care for a sick or injured relative who is domiciled in the employee's household. The employee shall report his illness prior to his scheduled work time if possible. If not, he shall see that his illness is reported within thirty (30) minutes after the time he is scheduled to report to work.
(3)
Those employees entitled to earn annual leave shall also be eligible to earn sick leave.
(4)
Full-time employees begin to accrue sick leave, immediately upon employment, at the rate of one-half day per month. Part-time and temporary employees shall not be eligible for sick leave.
(5)
A medical certificate signed by a licensed physician may be required by a department head to substantiate a request for sick leave for the following reasons:
a.
Any period of absence consisting of three (3) or more consecutive working days.
b.
To support a request for sick leave during a period when the employee is on vacation leave.
c.
Leave of any duration, if absence from duty recurs frequently or habitually, provided the employee has been notified or warned that a certificate may be required.
(6)
Unused sick leave, not to exceed forty-five (45) days, may be carried into the next fiscal year. This is the maximum allowable accumulation of sick leave. However, any eligible employee who has reached the maximum allowable accumulation of forty-five (45) days will be paid for the days earned but not taken during that fiscal year which exceed the forty-five (45) allowed days.
(7)
No sick leave in excess of the leave accumulated to the employee's credit may be granted unless such sick leave advance is specifically authorized by the county administrator upon recommendation of the department head and the human resources director.
(8)
A regular employee who separates from the county shall forfeit all unused sick leave. Such leave shall not be reinstated if the employee is rehired.
(g)
Other types of leave. Listed below are the additional types of leave allowed by the county:
(1)
Military leave. Military duty means training and service performed by an inductee, enlistee, reservist, or any entrant into a temporary component of the Armed Forces of the United States and time spent in reporting for and returning from such training in service. It also includes active duty training as a reservist in the Armed Forces of the United States or as a member of the National Guard of the United States.
(2)
Jury duty. An employee shall be given necessary time off without loss of pay when performing jury duty with submission of evidence of actual days spent in court and with prompt return to work when dismissed from service or released by the court. An employee in good standing is also entitled to any court fees received in conjunction with jury duty.
(3)
Civil leave. Any employee shall be given necessary time off, without the loss of pay, when performing emergency civilian duty in connection with national defense, when performing emergency duty with civil defense in connection with a natural disaster, or for the purpose of voting, when the polls are not open at least two (2) hours before or after an employee's scheduled hours of work.
(4)
Funeral leave. In the event of death in an employee's immediate family, he or she will be granted paid funeral leave of three (3) scheduled work days. Any additional time taken will be without pay, or annual leave may be used. For the purpose of funeral leave, immediate family is defined as an employee's spouse, child or stepchild and their spouses, father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother, sister, grandparents of the employee or of the employee's spouse, or any relative domiciled in the employee's household. For a brother-in-law or sister-in-law, funeral leave of one (1) day will be granted the day of the funeral.
(5)
Workers' compensation and injury leave. The basic purpose of workers' compensation is to provide fixed benefits, according to the law, in the event an employee is injured or in an accident while in the course of employment. When injured, no matter how minor the injury, you should report it as promptly as possible to your supervisor. The employee will be on injury leave for a period of time to be determined by the doctor. The employee may request use of sick leave, and/or annual leave, to supplement workers' compensation benefits.
(6)
Temporary disabilities not covered by workers' compensation. An employee who becomes temporarily disabled shall be allowed to exhaust his or her sick and vacation leave accumulations. After all sick and vacation leave have been used, further extension of leave, either with or without pay, must be specifically authorized by the county administrator, upon recommendation of the department head and the human resources director.
(7)
Family and medical leave of absence without pay. Employees who have been employed for at least the preceding twelve (12) months and who worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the preceding twelve (12) months are eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job protected leave per year (calendar) in the following situations:
a.
To care for a newborn child or a newly placed adopted or foster child;
b.
To care for a seriously ill child, spouse, or parent; or
c.
Because of the employee's own illness.
Whenever possible, the county must be given at least thirty (30) days notice of the employee's intention to take leave prior to the date that the leave shall begin. If such notice is not possible, the employee must give as much notice as is practicable. The county reserves the right to require that any such medical leave be certified by the health care provider of the employee, child, spouse, or parent as indicated. Certification will be sufficient if it includes the date on which the illness commenced, the probable duration of the illness, all available appropriate medical facts, and where applicable, a statement that the employee is unable to perform his or her job or needed to care for his or her child, spouse, or parent. Any eligible employee who takes leave under this provision is entitled to return at the same position held prior to taking leave. Further, any benefits the employee had accrued prior to taking leave will be retained when the employee resumes working. Accumulated sick or annual leave is to be used as part of the twelve (12) weeks allowable under FMLA. Absences of one (1) week or more sick leave will be deducted from the FMLA allowance.
(8)
Inclement weather leave. In the event of inclement weather, and transportation to the office is unsafe for employees, the county administrator may close the office. Employees will be notified of such closing by the news media.
(9)
Absence without leave. An absence of an employee from duty, including any absence for a single day or part of a day, that is not authorized by a specific grant of leave of absence or as a work schedule variation under the provisions of these regulations, shall be deemed to be an absence without leave. Any such absence shall be without pay, and shall be cause for disciplinary action.
(10)
Notification to human resources director. When an employee has taken leave of any kind, or is absent without leave, the department head shall notify the human resources director, in writing, within the same pay period in which the leave is taken or the absence without leave occurs. Such notification may be by notation on a time card or attendance sheet or by memo, giving specific information covering type of leave, dates and hours, and other pertinent data.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. X; Ord. of 12-19-06, § 1)
Sec. 10-35. - Acceptance of gifts or gratuities; conflict of interest.
(a)
Policy. It is the policy of the county that no employee shall accept gifts, gratuities, or loans from organizations, business concerns or individuals with whom he has official relationships, on business of the county. These limitations are not intended to prohibit the acceptance of articles, of negligible value, which are distributed generally, nor to prohibit employees from obtaining loans, from regular lending institutions, nor is it intended to preclude bona fide institutional fund-raising activities.
It is particularly important that employees guard against relationships which might be construed as evidence of favoritism, coercion, unfair advantage, or collusion. No county employee, officer or agent shall participate in the selection, award or administration of a contract, if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved.
(b)
Violations. Any violation of the above policy shall be communicated to the county administrator, and appropriate disciplinary action will be prescribed by the county administrator.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XI)
Sec. 10-36. - Appeals and grievance procedures other than for disciplinary action.
(a)
Policy. The most effective accomplishment of the work of the county requires prompt consideration and equitable adjustment of employee grievances. It is the desire of the county to adjust grievances informally, and both supervisors and employees are expected to make every effort to resolve problems as they arise. However, it is recognized that there will be grievances which will be resolved only after a formal appeal and review.
The purpose of this rule is to insure that all employees are afforded fair, equitable, and expeditious review of their grievances without fear, coercion, or discrimination.
(b)
Right of appeal. Any dispute between a supervisor and an employee concerning the interpretation of these policies may be appealed to the county administrator. If it is not satisfactorily resolved by the county administrator, it may be appealed to the board of commissioners, whose decision will be final.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XII)
Sec. 10-37. - Outside employment.
(a)
Rules. Outside employment is any paid employment, performed by an employee, in addition to his or her employment with the county. The following criteria will apply to outside employment:
(1)
Such employment shall not interfere with the efficient performance of the employee's duties.
(2)
Such employment shall not involve a conflict of interest or conflict with the employee's duties.
(3)
Such employment shall not involve the performance of duties which the employee should perform as part of his or her employment with the county.
(4)
Such employment shall not occur during the employee's regular or assigned working hours, unless the employee is on either annual leave, compensatory leave, or leave without pay.
(5)
No employee, granted permission to engage in outside employment, shall work at such outside employment for a longer period of time than stated in his or her request for permission to engage in such employment.
(6)
Any employee accepting outside employment under the terms of this rule shall make arrangements with the outside employer to be relieved from his or her outside duties, if and when called upon, for emergency service by the county.
(7)
In public safety areas, additional criteria may be established to govern the number of hours which may be worked in outside employment due to safety concerns.
(b)
Procedures. Any county employee desiring to perform outside employment shall first:
(1)
File a request, in writing, with his or her department head for permission to engage in outside employment. The request shall state the type of employment and the hours of work, the name of the prospective employer, and the place where he is to be employed.
(2)
The department head may either disapprove or recommend approval of the request. If the department head recommends approval, it may be granted by the county administrator or his designee if the criteria outlined above in subsection (a) are met.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XIII)
Sec. 10-38. - Employment of relatives.
(a)
Policy. The county may hire relatives of current employees if the new employee works in an entirely different department or location other than the current employee and does not work in a direct supervisor/employee relationship. Employees with the county at the time of the adoption of this policy are exempt from this provision.
(b)
Exceptions. Exceptions to this policy should be rarely necessary and must be reviewed by the county administrator.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XIV)
Sec. 10-39. - Political activity.

Encouraged to vote. Everyone is entitled to his personal political opinion and is encouraged to exercise his right to vote.

(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XV)
State Law reference— State department of public safety employees, political campaigns, O.C.G.A. § 35-2-12; nonelective state officers or employees holding office in political subdivision, political party, etc., O.C.G.A. § 45-10-70; coercion of other county officer, employee, etc., to make political contribution, O.C.G.A. § 45-11-10.
Sec. 10-40. - Equal opportunity and nondiscrimination.

Policy. There shall be no discrimination exercised due to race, national origin, color, religion, creed, age, handicap, sex, or political affiliation with respect to the recruiting and examination of applicants, the hiring of eligibles, or in any personnel transactions affecting employees, including training, promotion, separation and disciplinary actions. All personnel actions shall be based solely upon merit and fitness of the individual.

(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XVI)
Sec. 10-41. - Sexual harassment.
The county adopted a sexual harassment policy on December 6, 1994. The terms and conditions of this policy shall be followed by all employees at all times. Please see the language contained in the sexual harassment policy for the procedures which should be followed in any case where allegations of sexual harassment are made.
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XVII)
Sec. 10-42. - Categories of employment.
(a)
Types of employees. Listed below are the different types of employees utilized by the county:
(1)
Regular full-time employee;
(2)
Regular part-time employee;
(3)
Temporary employee;
(4)
Nonexempt;
(5)
Exempt.
(b)
Work schedule. The work schedule of the county is listed below:
(1)
Days and hours of work. The county's work week consists of forty (40) hours. However, the work week may vary for public safety positions.
(2)
Work week of nonexempt staff. See above.
(3)
Work week of exempt staff. Exempt employees' work schedules frequently will not coincide with the county's office hours. Exempt employees are expected to schedule their working hours, in consultation with their department head, to include evening meetings and activities outside the county's office hours. The annual salary of exempt employees is remuneration for the total responsibilities of their jobs. On those occasions where special meetings and activities, such as conferences and meetings that require weekend travel, etc., require an exempt employee working a substantial amount of overtime, some time may be given, with pay, to permit the individual to rest and care for personal matters. Such time shall always be given in close proximity to the period of overtime work and in an amount determined at the department head's discretion, after consultation with the county administrator or his designee. It must be used at once, with department head approval, and is not cumulative.
The nature of many exempt jobs makes it impossible to confine the working schedule within usual office hours. It is the responsibility of both the employee and department head to plan irregular work schedules, when necessary, which permit accomplishment of all the regular duties of the job as designated by the county. The need to grant paid time off, due to excessive overtime, should arise only where special meetings and conferences outside the ongoing duties of the job require substantial additional hours of work. Distinction should be made between these special meetings and conferences and the schedule required by the usual duties of the job.
An example of "substantial additional hours of work," which might warrant some time off, would be five (5) or more additional hours of work for four (4) consecutive weeks. The department head, after consulting with the county administrator or his designee, may grant one-half day of time off. Time off would be given immediately following the work period as stated above.
When paid time off is granted to exempt employees, it is important that it be clear that it is not considered additional compensation for time worked, due to additional hours worked. It is to be given as a token of appreciation for the employee's effort and, consequently, bears no defined relationship to the number of hours of overtime worked.
Frequent need for employees to work overtime, to complete their usual responsibilities, can be a signal to examine the work situation. Is the work load manageable? Is additional help needed?
(Ord. of 12-19-95, Ch. XVIII)
Secs. 10-43—10-60. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY

Sec. 10-61. - Policy established.
The county is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when any county employee illegally uses drugs on or off the job, comes to work under their influence, possesses, distributes or sells drugs in the work place, or abuses alcohol on the job. Therefore, the county has established the following policy:
(1)
It is a violation of county policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job.
(2)
It is a violation of company policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or impaired by alcohol.
(3)
It is a violation of the county policy for any employee to use prescription drugs illegally, i.e., to use prescription drugs that have not been legally obtained or in a manner or for a purpose other than as prescribed. (However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications.)
(4)
Violations of this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including terminations.
(Ord. of 4-16-96)
Sec. 10-62. - Supervisors' responsibility.
It is the responsibility of the county's supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a drug problem. Although it is not the supervisor's job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and coworkers should encourage anyone who has a drug problem to seek help.
(Ord. of 4-16-96)
Sec. 10-63. - Goal, intent.
The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive and drug-free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment in the county.
(Ord. of 4-16-96)
Sec. 10-64. - Resource information.
The county offers resource information on various means of employee assistance in the community, including but not limited to drug and alcohol abuse programs. Employees are encouraged to use this resource file, which is located in the human resources department in the county administration building. In addition, the county will distribute this information to employees for their confidential use.
(Ord. of 4-16-96)
Sec. 10-65. - General procedures.
(a)
An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to properly perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status. Next, the supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse has occurred. If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, the employee will be sent home or to a medical facility by taxi or other safe transportation alternative, depending on the determination of the observed impairment, and accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. A drug test may be in order. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive.
(b)
Employees and job applicants who have a positive confirmed test result may explain or contest the result to the county within five (5) working days after the county contacts the employee or job applicant and shows him/her the positive test result as it was received from the laboratory in writing.
