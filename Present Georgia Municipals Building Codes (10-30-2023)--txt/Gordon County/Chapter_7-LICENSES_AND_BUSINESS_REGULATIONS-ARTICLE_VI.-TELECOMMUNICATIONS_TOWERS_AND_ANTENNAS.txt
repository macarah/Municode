Sec. 7-205. - General requirements.
The location and construction of towers governed by this article shall comply with the following requirements:
(1)
Construction/inspections.
a.
Towers shall be constructed and maintained in compliance with applicable building codes, industry standards, and standards for towers published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Towers shall be structurally designed and constructed to allow for a minimum of three (3) shared uses. Tower owners shall be responsible for periodic written inspections of such towers at least every twelve (12) months to ensure structural integrity. Such inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer with a current license issued by the State of Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be submitted to the county office of building, planning and development and shall be maintained by the tower owner(s) and available for public review upon request.
b.
If, upon inspection, the office of building, planning and development concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and poses a danger to persons or property, then upon written notice thereof to the owner, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance. Should the owner fail to bring the tower into compliance within thirty (30) days, the county may remove such tower at the owner's expense pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-12.
c.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no tower permit shall be issued for a tower with less than three (3) shared uses without a variance granted by the county board of appeals.
(2)
Regulatory compliance. Tower owners shall annually certify in writing to the office of building, planning and development in January of each year that each tower is in compliance with standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner(s) of the towers governed by this article shall bring such towers or antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling agency.
(3)
Security. All towers, except alternative tower structures, shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an anti-climbing device.
(4)
Advertising. Except for the owner's identifying name plate, advertising on towers shall be prohibited.
(5)
Tower lighting. Illumination is prohibited on towers, except where required by the FCC or FAA, as necessary for air traffic safety. When illumination is required, documentation shall be provided with the application identifying the type of illumination required and any available alternatives. The county may review alternative permissible illumination and may approve the design causing the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
(6)
Access. Access for maintenance vehicles shall be the right-of-way which would most minimize interference with public traffic. Proposed sites which lack frontage on a public or private road shall provide an easement at least twenty (20) feet wide with at least twelve (12) feet graveled or paved travel way.
(7)
Hazardous/volatile substances. Use of a lot by a tower shall be prohibited when another principal use, on the same lot, includes storage, distribution, or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive, or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas, dangerous chemicals, or hazardous waste when such materials are not part of an emergency power source for the tower facilities.
(8)
Maintenance/operation structures. Maintenance/operation structures adjacent to any tower facility area shall be used only to house equipment and other supplies directly in support of the tower. Such structures shall not be used for offices, vehicle storage or for any continuous human occupation. Any equipment not used in direct support of a tower site shall not be stored on the site.
(9)
Historic sites. Tower facilities shall not be attached to or mounted to historically significant buildings, structures, or places identified by placement upon the national register of historic places, by designation as a state historical site, by designation by the county historical society as a historic site, or as part of a locally designated historic district.
(10)
Setbacks and separations. All towers shall comply with the following standards, except that existing alternative tower structures are exempt from the minimum setback and separation requirements of this section; provided however, that such alternative tower structure must be a conforming use within the zoning district in which it is located for this setback exemption to apply as a matter of right.
a.
All towers and antennas shall set back at least a distance equal to the height of the tower plus fifteen (15) feet, from any dwelling, zoning district line, or public property.
b.
All towers and maintenance/operation structures (including guy wires) shall comply with the setbacks as required by the zoning district in which the tower is to be located.
c.
The height limitations applicable to buildings in the zoning districts in which the tower or alternative tower structure is located shall not apply to such facilities or structures as a result of the tower or antenna.
(11)
Buffers and screening.
a.
Tower sites shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials such that the view of the base of the tower is screened from any public rights-of-way, public property, and any other privately owned property.
b.
In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, this landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the building inspector upon specific findings by the building inspector.
c.
Existing mature growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited upon large, wooded lots, natural growth around the perimeter of the property may be a sufficient buffer if so determined by the building inspector upon specific findings by the building inspector.
d.
In buffer construction, native vegetation shall be preserved to the fullest extent possible.
(12)
Visual impact.
a.
Towers shall maintain a galvanized matte steel finish or be painted a natural, earth-toned color, unless otherwise required by the FAA.
b.
The design of buildings and accessory structures at tower base of facility sites shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping which create the greatest level of compatibility with the natural environment and existing land use patterns.
c.
Antennas installed on an alternative tower structure and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a natural color that is similar to or compliments the color of the alternative tower structure.
d.
Tower antennas shall be designed to be visually compatible with the exterior of the alternative tower structure to which they are to be attached.
(Ord. of 10-6-98, Art. V)
Sec. 7-206. - Shared use/colocation.
New tower sites shall not be permitted if there is an existing technically and commercially reasonable space available for shared use/colocation on preexisting towers and antennas or existing conforming towers and antennas.
