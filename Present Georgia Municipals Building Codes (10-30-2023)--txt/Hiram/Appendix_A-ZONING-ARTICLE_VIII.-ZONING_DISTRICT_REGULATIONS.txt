Sec. I. - OSRD Open Space Residential Development.
The Open Space Residential Development District (OSRD) promotes development strategies for large tracts of land that can help communities preserve open space and natural areas in residential housing developments. The OSRD strategically allows the clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive areas, which in-turn preserves groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. The clustering of houses and structures also reduces the amount of infrastructure required to serve the development and lessens potential erosion and sedimentation impacts. The OSRD promotes interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the development and supports contiguous greenspace with adjacent communities. Walking trails, bike paths, public gathering places, use of parks and community facilities, as focal points are requirements of an OSRD. Other OSRD standards to promote coherent aesthetics within the community include landscaping requirements, underground utilities, recreational amenities, streetlights, sidewalks, and primary building setbacks. In addition, plans for OSRD approval by the governing authority shall require the provision of a public sewage disposal system as approved by the City of Hiram, Georgia, Paulding County, Georgia, and the State of Georgia, authorities, as applicable.
An Open Space Residential Development District must consist of a minimum of fifty (50) contiguous acres of land with at least forty percent (40%) of the total area designated for open space. Individual lot and dwelling sizes are to be approved when specific plans are submitted to the governing authority, with the provision that the maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre in an OSRD shall not exceed 3.0 units. This allows for a more efficient lot layout in respect to the natural features of the property.
(1)
Purpose. The Open Space Residential Development District is a residential district that provides for the proper development of larger tracts of land in a coordinated, well planned manner. The features of this district include the following:
(a)
To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure.
(b)
To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
(c)
To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat.
(d)
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
(e)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development.
(f)
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
(g)
To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
(h)
To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
(i)
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
(j)
To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
(k)
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
(l)
To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
(2)
Guidelines for review. The review of the Open Space Residential Development District shall consider the following general intentions, objectives, and purpose prior to approval by the governing authority:
(a)
Whether the development will be compatible with the topography, hydrology, and other natural features of the land, and whether any unusual topographic or other natural features will be affected.
(b)
Whether the character, design, and layout of the proposed uses will be adequate and appropriate to encourage a desirable living environment.
(c)
Whether the development will adversely affect any adjacent properties.
(d)
Whether the development will be able to preserve the natural amenities of streams, wooded areas, wetlands, and other similar features.
(e)
Whether the existing and or proposed streets, utilities, and other public services are adequate to serve the development.
(f)
Whether protective deed covenants are established to provide for the perpetual maintenance, security, and the continuation of dedicated area.
(3)
Types of permitted uses. The Open Space Residential Development District is a planned district that permits uses that are primarily residential in character and shall consist of single-family detached dwelling units with customary home occupations and appropriate accessory uses and structures, and limited recreational uses, as approved by the governing authority. Churches, schools, and limited day-care facilities planned as part of the OSRD, at its application inception, are also allowed; provided however, that such uses, if introduced as a part of the OSRD development after the OSRD development has been reviewed and approved by the governing authority, shall require review and approval by the governing authority through a subsequent amended application process.
(4)
Minimum site area. The minimum site area shall be restricted to no less than fifty (50) contiguous acres developed under one coordinated plan.
(5)
Gross density. The maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre in an OSRD shall not exceed 3.0 units.
(6)
Ownership of Development Site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
(7)
Application for approval of an Open Space Residential Development. An application for an Open Space Residential Development shall be submitted on forms provided by the Department of Community Development, Planning and Zoning Division, of Paulding County, Georgia, as provided for in this Ordinance, and shall be advertised in the same manner as applications for rezoning.
