For multi-day special events, an acceptable plan must provide for removal of all rubbish, garbage, and any other waste byproducts generated each day; provided, however, that exceptions, with written approval from the city manager, may be provided for certain types of rubbish, garbage, and other waste byproducts where daily removal for a multi-day event is not reasonably practicable and the public's health, welfare, and safety would reasonably be determined not to be endangered.
(10)

Also identified on the depiction shall be the locations for any temporary structures, including toilet facilities, and parking to be utilized with the special event.
The 60—120 day window for applying for a special event permit is waived for special events proposed in response to immediate, current events defined as events occurring within seven days prior to the proposed special event. In such instances the producer of the special event is required to submit the application required by this section no later than 72 hours prior to the special event, and, if not practicable, the producer shall give the city manager written notice of the special event at least 24 hours prior to its commencement and provide with the notice as much of the information required in this section as is possible and practicable.

In addition to the information required above in an application for a special event permit, the following materials and information must be provided in support of and in addition to the application, all of which must be provided before an application will be considered:
(1)
If the producer is a corporation, the state and date of incorporation, a representation that the corporation is qualified to do business in Georgia, and the name and address of the registered agent for service of process for the corporation in Georgia.
(2)
A sworn declaration that the producer is in compliance with the State of Georgia SAVE and E-Verify requirements or that the producer is not subject to those requirements, describing the reason(s) for any claimed exemption with sufficient particularity to permit a determination of the bona fides of the claim.
(3)
The producer's State of Georgia Department of Revenue sales and/or use tax registration number or an explanation describing the reason(s) for any claimed exemption with sufficient particularity to permit a determination of the bona fides of the claim.
(4)
Identification of any location(s) within the prior 12 months where the producer conducted a similar special event.

(6)
A legible copy of any current occupation tax certificate issued by a governing body in the State of Georgia. If the producer cannot produce a duly issued occupation tax certificate and is not otherwise exempted from compliance, then the producer must, as a condition for a permit, file for an occupation tax certificate from the city. If an exemption is claimed from payment of an occupation tax, the producer shall describe the exemption with sufficient particularity to determine the bona fides of such a claim.
(7)
Copies of written notices informing residences and businesses adjacent to the event area of the intent to host a special event. If the special event involves a parade, procession, or other event without a centralized location, this notification requirement may be waived by the city manager upon request. This notification requirement may also be waived if the city manager determines it would be unreasonable and unduly burdensome in light of the number of residences and businesses to be notified.
(8)
Proof of comprehensive liability insurance naming the city as an additional insured. Such insurance must provide at a minimum $1,000,000.00 of coverage for personal injury per person and $1,000,000.00 of property damage coverage covering all claims arising from a permit issued under this chapter. The city manager may waive or reduce this requirement for a special event that:
a.
Will not require or involve one or more of the following activities: closing (full or partial) of a public street; blocking or obstructing public property; the provision of merchandise, food, or beverages (whether by sale or otherwise); the erection, use, or installation of a tent, canopy, stage, trailer, grandstand, bleachers, or any other structure; use of any kind of pyrotechnics or sound amplification devices; or placement and use of portable toilets; and

Proper proof of Section 501(c) status and/or registration as required by O.C.G.A. § 43-17-1 et seq. is required.
In exercising this discretion, the city manager shall consider the nature of the activities planned for the participants in the proposed special event; the risk of potential injury or harm to private property and private persons arising from the activities planned for the participants in the proposed special event; and the risk of potential injury or harm to public property arising from the activity planned for the participants in the proposed special event.
(9)
The producer shall provide a written agreement in a form satisfactory to the city providing that the producer shall defend, pay, and hold harmless the city, its elected and appointed officials, employees, and agents from liability for all personal and property damages arising from any acts or omissions resulting from a special event, inclusive also of any claims for attorneys' fees and costs connected with such claims, except for such claims arising solely from the negligent acts of the city, its elected and appointed officials, employees, and agents.
(10)
Such other information as may be reasonably requested by the city and reasonably related to the scope and scale of the special event, how it is to be conducted, and the other information required by this chapter to be provided.
(11)
In addition, the producer shall confer with the appropriate city representatives and establish an acceptable plan for vehicular/pedestrian traffic, crowd and traffic control, and security for the special event proposed.

An application fee shall be paid at the time the application is filed for a special event permit to defray the city's administrative expense and costs. The fee shall be set from time to time as determined by the governing authority. The application fee is nonrefundable.
(b)
Exempt from payment of the application fee is any special event on behalf of or seeking to benefit wholly (1) an entity or organization recognized by the Federal Internal Revenue Service as satisfying the requirements of 26 U.S.C. § 501(c) or (2) a charitable organization subject to and governed by O.C.G.A. § 43-17-1 et seq. Proper proof of section 501(c) status and/or registration as required by O.C.G.A. § 43-17-1 et seq. is required for this exemption. The exemption for a charitable organization subject to and governed by O.C.G.A. § 43-17-1 et seq. applies only for a special event seeking to raise support for or awareness of a charitable purpose as that phrase is defined in O.C.G.A. § 43-17-2(3), as amended from time to time.

This review and provision of an assessment and evaluation shall be accomplished within seven business days of circulation absent agreement with the producer for additional time. If additional time is necessary due to the absence of one or more persons who would review the request for a permit and the producer does not agree to additional time to permit the person(s) to review the application and materials, the application may be denied for lack of appropriate review.
(c)
Upon receiving the departmental assessment(s) and evaluation(s), the city manager may require the producer to provide additional information or response to address any concern(s) or issue(s) raised if such is reasonably necessary to address any of the factors to be evaluated per section 7-9 below.

If additional time is necessary due to the absence of the city manager and the producer does not agree to additional time to permit the city manager's review of the application and materials, the application may be denied for lack of appropriate review.

(c)
Conditions may be imposed with issuance of a permit to reasonably address concerns described in subsection (b) above.

Sec. 7-10. - Vendors.
