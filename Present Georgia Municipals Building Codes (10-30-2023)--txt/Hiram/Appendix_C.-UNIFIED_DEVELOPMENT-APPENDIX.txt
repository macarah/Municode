Any conforming property currently zoned to the PRD Planned Residential Development District will be considered vested. The regulations for the PRD Planned Residential Development District are as follows:
The Planned Residential Development District is a district that promotes the proper use of larger tracts of land in a flexible, innovative, and creative concept. This district encourages the preservation of the natural amenities of the land, and provides a stable residential environment as it plans for an efficient use of the land by comprehensive and detailed use for streets, utilities, and building sites. These plans shall also include specific areas dedicated for open space use with the appropriate covenants to insure permanent maintenance of said areas. In addition, plans for approval by the governing authority shall require the provision of a central sewage disposal system as approved City of Hiram, Georgia, Paulding County Georgia, and the State of Georgia authorities, as applicable. Major deviations from these detailed plans have to be re-submitted to the governing authority for approval.
A Planned Development District must consist of a minimum of fifty (50) contiguous acres of land with at least ten percent (10%) of the total area designated for open space or public use. These areas shall be defined and delineated on specific site plans with appropriate deed covenants to ensure adherence to the submitted plans.
