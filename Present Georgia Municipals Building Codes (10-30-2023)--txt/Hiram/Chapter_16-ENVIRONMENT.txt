Sec. 16-60. - Description.
This article provides a framework for the city to develop buffer zones for streams, as well as the requirements that minimize land development within those buffers. It is the purpose of these buffer zone requirements to protect and stabilize stream banks, protect water quality and preserve aquatic and riparian habitat.
(Ord. No. 06-94A, intro., 9-5-2006)
Sec. 16-61. - Title.
This article shall be known as the "City of Hiram Stream Buffer Protection Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 06-94A, § 1, 9-5-2006)
Sec. 16-62. - Findings and purposes.
(a)
Findings. Whereas, the city finds that buffers adjacent to streams provide numerous benefits including:
(1)
Protecting, restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of streams and their water resources;
(2)
Removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater;
(3)
Reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation;
(4)
Protecting and stabilizing stream banks;
(5)
Providing for infiltration of stormwater runoff;
(6)
Maintaining base flow of streams;
(7)
Contributing organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem;
(8)
Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat;
(9)
Providing riparian wildlife habitat;
(10)
Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity; and
(11)
Providing opportunities for the protection and restoration of greenspace.
(b)
Purposes. It is the purpose of this article to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; and to maintain stream water quality by provisions designed to:
(1)
Create buffer zones along the streams of the city for the protection of water resources; and
(2)
Minimize land development within such buffers by establishing buffer zone requirements and by requiring authorization for any such activities.

Sec. 16-64. - Applicability.
(a)
This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 16-63. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
(1)
Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities:
a.
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of this article.
b.
Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements.
c.
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of this article.
d.
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of this article.
e.
Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this ordinance takes effect or approved under the terms of this article.
f.
Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures.
(2)
Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property:

If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
(b)
This article shall apply to all new subdividing and platting activities.
(c)
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 16-65(b).
(Ord. No. 06-94A, § 4, 9-5-2006)
Sec. 16-65. - Land development requirements.
(a)
Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements:
(1)
An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank.

(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.
(b)
Variance procedures. Variances from the buffer and setback requirements in subsection (a) of this section may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city manager or his designee finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the county zoning board of variances and appeals may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided above, the county zoning board of variances and appeals shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote by the county zoning board of variances and appeals. The city manager or his designee shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city manager or his designee shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship.
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(3)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(4)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

ARTICLE IV. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION

Sec. 16-126. - Description.
An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to the city separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or nonpolluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This article provides the city with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities.
(Ord. No. 06-94C, intro., 9-5-2006)
Sec. 16-127. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters.
(2)
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
(3)
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
(4)
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
(5)
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city separate storm sewer system.
(6)
Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system.
(7)
Therefore, the city adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
(Ord. No. 06-94C, intro., 9-5-2006)
Sec. 16-128. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the city separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the city separate storm sewer system by any person;
(2)
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city separate storm sewer system;
(3)
Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city separate storm sewer system; and
(4)
Establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.
(b)

(Ord. No. 2021-02, § 1(Exh. A), 2-2-2021)
Sec. 16-158. - Stormwater management standards.
Subject to the applicability criteria in section 16-156 and exemptions in section 16-157, the following stormwater management standards apply. Additional details for each standard can be found in the GSMM section 2.2.2.2:
(1)
Design of stormwater management system. The design of the stormwater management system shall be in accordance with the applicable sections of the GSMM as directed by the administrator. Any design which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.
(2)
Natural resources inventory. Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic, found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the stormwater management plan, shall include, at a minimum (as applicable):
a.
Topography (minimum of two-foot contours) and steep slopes (i.e., areas with slopes greater than 15 percent),
b.
Natural drainage divides and patterns,
c.
Natural drainage features (e.g., swales, basins, depressional areas),
d.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors,
e.
Predominant soils (including erodible soils and karst areas), and
f.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
(3)
Better site design practices for stormwater management. Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM section 2.3.
(4)
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction. Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by the applicant through runoff reduction. To the extent (A) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (B) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
a.
Runoff reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first one inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
b.
Water quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in section 16-156, the city manager or his/her designee may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
(5)
Stream channel protection. Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
a.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
b.
Erosion prevention measures, such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and
c.
Preservation of any applicable stream buffer.
(6)
Overbank flood protection. Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event.
(7)
Extreme flood protection. Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
(8)
Trout stream protection. Trout stream protection shall be provided by controlling temperature for receiving waters with trout stream designation. In streams designated as primary trout waters by the wildlife resources division, there shall be no elevation of natural stream temperatures. In streams designated as secondary trout waters, there shall be no elevation exceeding 2°F of natural stream temperatures.
(9)
Downstream analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
(10)
Stormwater management system inspection and maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the city manager or his/her designee, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system. This plan shall be written in accordance with the requirements in section 16-167.
