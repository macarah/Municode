B.
If vehicular parking or storage space required cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the board of zoning appeals may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property provided such space lies within 400 feet of the main entrance to such principal use. Such vehicular parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner; and
C.
The required parking space for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot but the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that one-half of the parking space required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sunday may be assigned to a use which will be closed at nights or on Sundays.
