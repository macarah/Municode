NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and understandings herein made and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do consent and agree as follows:
1.
This Agreement shall commence on the date of execution and shall continue through and including September 30, 2006.

3.
Within 30 days of the execution of this Agreement, the County Administrator shall designate the County's staff liaison for the use of inmate labor to remove graffiti from private property. The County's staff liaison will use his or her best efforts to schedule the use of inmate labor to remove graffiti from private property within the City as soon as reasonably practical. Gwinnett County reserves the absolute right to decline a request for the use of inmate labor in the event that such manpower is necessary to perform Gwinnett County work, which shall always be a priority. Gwinnett County further reserves the right to decline a request for inmate labor in the event that the provision of such inmate labor would be contrary to Georgia law or outside the scope of this Agreement, the provision of inmate labor poses an unacceptable risk of harm to inmates or Gwinnett County personnel, the provision of inmate labor poses an unacceptable risk of escape, or for any other reason as determined by the Warden of the Gwinnett County Department of Corrections.
4.
The use of inmate labor for removal of graffiti from private property within the City shall be governed by the County's existing policies concerning the same. The County's policies are attached to this Agreement as Exhibit "A" and by this reference made a part hereof.

The City's staff liaison shall be responsible for obtaining the property owner's consent to the removal of graffiti from his or her property and any and all fully executed documents required pursuant to the County's policies attached as Exhibit "A."
6.
This Agreement constitutes all of the understandings and agreements of every nature or kind existing between the parties with respect to the use of inmate labor for removal of graffiti from private property within the City.

This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon sixty days prior written notice to the other.

This Agreement shall not be changed or modified except by agreement in writing executed by the parties.
9.
This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.
10.
It is agreed that the illegality or invalidity of any term or clause of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of the remainder of the Agreement, and the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if such illegal or invalid term or clause were not contained herein unless the elimination of such provision detrimentally reduces the consideration that any party is to receive under this Agreement or materially affects the continuing operation of this Agreement.
11.
Each party to this Agreement shall comply with all applicable local, State, and Federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations.
12.
No consent or waiver, express or implied, by either party to this Agreement, to any breach of any covenant, condition, or duty of the other party shall be construed as a consent to or waiver of any future breach of the same.
