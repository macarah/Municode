(b)
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section:
All-terrain vehicle means any motorized vehicle designed for off-road use which is equipped with three or more low pressure tires and with a seat to be straddled by the operator and with handlebars for steering control.
Automobile means a passenger vehicle primarily designed to legally travel on the highways of this state that usually has an engine capable of propelling the vehicle over 35 miles per hour.
Bicycle means every device propelled by human power upon which any person may ride, having only two wheels which are in tandem and either of which is more than 13 inches in diameter.
Dealer means a person engaged in the business of buying, selling, or exchanging vehicles who has an established place of business in this state.
Electric bicycle means a device with two or three wheels which has a saddle and fully operative pedals for human propulsion and also has an electric motor. For such a device to be considered an electric assisted bicycle, it shall meet the requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, as set forth in 49 C.F.R. Section 571, et seq., and shall operate in such a manner that the electric motor disengages or ceases to function when the brakes are applied. The electric motor in an electric assisted bicycle shall:
(1)
Have a power output of not more than 1,000 watts;
(2)
Be incapable of propelling the device at a speed of more than 20 miles per hour on level ground; and
(3)
Be incapable of further increasing the speed of the device when human power alone is used to propel the device at or more than 20 miles per hour.
Electric personal assistive mobility device or EPAMD means a self-balancing, two non-tandem wheeled device designed to transport only one person and having an electric propulsion system with average power of 750 watts (one horsepower) and a maximum speed of less than 20 miles per hour on a paved level surface when powered solely by such propulsion system and ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds.
Electric play vehicle means an electric scooter, electric skateboard, electric unicycle or other device that is self-propelled by an electric motor with a maximum speed of up to 20 miles per hour designed to carry one person at a time, equipped with one or two wheels, and is not otherwise defined in this Code as a "motorized cart," "low speed motor vehicle (LSMV)," "motor vehicle," "motorcycle," "electric bicycle," "electric personal assistive mobility device (EPAMD)," or "motorized wheelchair."
Gross weight means the weight of a vehicle without load plus the weight of any load thereon.
Low-speed motor vehicle or LSMV means any four-wheeled electric vehicle whose top speed attainable in one mile is greater than 20 miles per hour but not greater than 25 miles per hour on a paved level surface and which is manufactured in compliance with those federal motor vehicle safety standards for low-speed vehicles set forth in 49 C.F.R. Section 571.500 and in effect on January 1, 2001.
Moped means a motor driven cycle equipped with two or three wheels, with or without foot pedals to permit muscular propulsion, and an independent power source providing a maximum of two brake horsepower. If a combustion engine is used, the maximum piston or rotor displacement shall be 3.05 cubic inches (50 cubic centimeters) regardless of the number of chambers in such power source. The power source shall be capable of propelling the vehicle, unassisted, at a speed not to exceed 30 miles per hour (48.28 kilometers per hour) on level road surface and shall be equipped with a power drive system that functions directly or automatically only, not requiring clutching or shifting by the operator after the drive system is engaged.
Motorcycle means every motor vehicle having a seat or saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with the ground, but excluding a tractor, all-terrain vehicle, dirt bike, and moped.
Motor driven cycle means every motorcycle, including every motor scooter, with a motor which produces not to exceed five brake horsepower, every bicycle with a motor attached, and every moped.
Motorized cart means every motor vehicle having no less than three wheels and an unladen weight of 1,300 pounds or less and which cannot operate at more than 20 miles per hour.
Motorized play vehicle means a coaster, pocket bike, any other alternatively fueled device, or other motorized vehicle that is self-propelled by a motor engine, gas or electric, and is not otherwise defined in this Code as a "motorized cart," "low speed motor vehicle (LSMV)," "motor vehicle," "motorcycle," "electric bicycle," "electric play vehicle," "electric personal assistive mobility device" or "motorized wheelchair."
Motorized wheelchair means a self-propelled wheelchair that is used by a physically disabled person for mobility.
Pocket motorcycle or pocket bike means a two-wheeled vehicle other than a motor vehicle, bicycle with helper motor or a motorized scooter and which is propelled by an internal combustion engine, electric motor or other mechanical means, is capable of carrying a rider and/or passenger at a speed in excess of 20 miles per hour, and is designed to replicate the general appearance of a motorcycle, regardless of the scale of the replication.
Recreation path means a paved area of generally six feet or more in width that is designed or intended for multi-use such as pedestrians, bicyclists, motorized carts, or any other approved use.
Sidewalk means a paved area of generally five feet in width or less that is designed or intended for the use of pedestrian traffic only.

Two numerical decals shall be issued upon registration; and a record of each motorized cart number, along with the name and address of the owner, shall be maintained by the finance division. The decals must be affixed to the sides of the cart in such a manner as to be fully visible at all times.
