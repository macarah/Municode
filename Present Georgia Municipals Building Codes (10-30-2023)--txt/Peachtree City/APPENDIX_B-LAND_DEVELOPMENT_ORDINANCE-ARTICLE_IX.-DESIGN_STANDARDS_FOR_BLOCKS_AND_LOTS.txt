ARTICLE IX. - DESIGN STANDARDS FOR BLOCKS AND LOTS

Sec. 901. - Block lengths and widths.
Block lengths and widths shall be determined by design considerations. It is suggested that blocks shall not be greater than 1,800 feet, nor less than 600 feet in length.
Sec. 902. - Lot sizes.
Lots shall meet the lot width and lot area requirements of the zoning ordinance [appendix A].
Where individual septic tanks are used, the county health officer shall prescribe the minimum lot sizes to conform to health standards, but in no case shall be less than one acre.
Sec. 903. - Multiple- and reverse-frontage lots.
Multiple-frontage and reverse-frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. Review section 706, special screening and section 604, landscape plans approval, for possible requirements if multiple or reverse frontage lots are located in city greenbelt areas.
