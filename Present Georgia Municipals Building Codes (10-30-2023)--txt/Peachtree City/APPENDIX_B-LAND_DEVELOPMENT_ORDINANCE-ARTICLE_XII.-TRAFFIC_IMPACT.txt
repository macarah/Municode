--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 724, adopted Nov. 4, 1999, renumbered art. XII, §§ 1201 and 1202 as art. XIII, §§ 1301 and 1302 and added a new art. XII, §§ 1201—1209 as herein set out.

Sec. 1201. - Purpose and scope.
The implementation of the master plan for the development of Peachtree City has been temporarily disrupted because of delays with the DOT project to improve GA 54 to a four-lane arterial thoroughfare between GA 74 and Coweta County.
Therefore, in order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, it has been determined to be necessary to adopt the following traffic impact ordinance for the GA 54 corridor. The corridor is defined as all that property both north and south of GA 54 between GA 74 and Coweta County, and extending from the GA 54 right-of-way a distance of 6000 feet to the north and 6000 feet to the south.
The traffic impact ordinance shall establish a minimum standard of traffic operations for the corridor and provide for an administrative process to assure that no development is undertaken that would result in a lowering of the level of traffic operations below that established minimum standard.
This article shall remain in effect until the DOT highway improvements are under contract or upon the GDOT's refusal to issue further mitigation-project permits.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 806, 4-17-03)
Sec. 1202. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all development projects in the city for which a development permit has not been issued as of the date of the adoption of this article.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99)
Sec. 1203. - Traffic impact model.
The city shall retain a traffic engineering consultant to prepare and maintain a traffic impact model for the corridor. The model will be based on the traffic conditions in the corridor at the time the article is adopted. The model will then be updated to reflect the impact of each new project that is subsequently approved for development in accordance with this article.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99)
Sec. 1204. - Acceptable standard of traffic operations.
The minimum acceptable standard of traffic operations within the corridor shall be defined as follows:
(a)
For an unsignalized intersection, the average total delay per vehicle shall not exceed 45 seconds.
(b)
For a signalized intersection, the volume to capacity composite ratio shall not exceed 1.10; and the average total delay per vehicle shall not exceed 60 seconds.
(c)
The delays referred to in (a) and (b) above shall be calculated according to the methodology described in the Highway Capacity Manual, as updated in 1994.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99)
Sec. 1205. - Traffic impact study.
(a)
A traffic impact study shall be performed for any proposed new development project within the corridor that has access only from GA 54, or is otherwise located within the corridor on a street which ultimately only has access from GA54.
(b)
A traffic impact study shall be performed for any proposed new development project outside the corridor, if that project will generate 100 or more peak-hour trips, as defined in the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) publication, Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development.
(c)
A traffic impact study must be performed by a qualified traffic engineer.
(d)
A traffic impact study must be prepared at the expense of the developer of a proposed project.
(e)
A traffic impact study, if required, must be performed in accordance with the general guidelines recommended in the ITE publication, Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site Development, unless otherwise specified in this article or as directed by the city. A traffic study must include the projected traffic from all previously approved projects that are not yet in place at the time of the study. The extent of the study area must be clearly defined by the developer and approved by the city prior to actually initiating the study. And the study must, as a minimum, include a thorough analysis of the A.M. and P.M. peak-hour traffic over the entire corridor.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-99; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-99)
Sec. 1206. - Evaluation and determination.
Each required traffic impact study will be evaluated by the city as to its technical accuracy and its impact on the established minimum standard of traffic operations in the corridor. The cost of this evaluation shall be reimbursed to the city by the developer; and each evaluation shall produce a determination that a proposed project either complies with the established standard or it does not comply.
(a)
If it is determined that a proposed project complies with the established minimum standard of traffic operations for all intersections in the corridor, a development permit shall be issued for the project, provided it meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances.
(b)
If it is determined that a proposed project will not comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations at one or more intersections in the corridor, the developer may:
(1)
Reach an agreement with the city on a plan to mitigate the negative impact the project will have on traffic in the corridor; or
(2)
Delay implementation of the project until the thoroughfare capacity is increased in accordance with the DOT plans; or
(3)
Delay implementation until traffic is reduced in the corridor by other capital improvements to the point where the proposed project is able to comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations within the corridor.
(c)
If a developer reaches an agreement with the city on a plan to mitigate the negative impact of a project in accordance with (b)(1) above, a development permit shall be issued for the project, provided the mitigation plan is fully implemented as a part of the permitted work, and provided the project, including the mitigation plan, meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances.
(d)
If a developer delays implementation of a project until the thoroughfare capacity is increased in accordance with (b)(2) above, a development permit shall be issued for the project upon completion of the DOT improvement work, provided the project meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances.
(e)
If a developer delays implementation of a project in accordance with (b)(3) above, a development permit shall be issued for the project upon completion of other capital improvements that reduce traffic in the corridor to the point where the project is able to comply with the established minimum standard of traffic operations within the corridor, provided the project meets all other applicable city codes and ordinances, as well as all other portions of this article.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-1999; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-1999)
Sec. 1207. - Updating the model.
Once an evaluation and determination are made by the city and a permit is issued based on that determination, the city's traffic engineering consultant shall update the traffic impact model to reflect that determination. The cost of updating the model shall be reimbursed to the city by the developer of the proposed development project.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-1999; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-1999)
Sec. 1208. - Expiration of determination.
(a)
For any project for which a traffic impact analysis is required by this article, a traffic impact determination must be issued prior to final site plan approval or preliminary plat approval. That determination shall expire if a developer fails to secure a development permit for the project within 90 days of the date the determination is made.
(b)
A traffic impact determination shall expire if a developer fails to initiate construction on a project within 90 days of the issuance of a development permit.
(c)
A traffic impact determination shall expire if a developer ceases work on a project for more than 60 consecutive days after a development permit is issued.
(d)
If a traffic impact determination expires for any of the above reasons, the city's traffic engineering consultant shall re-adjust the traffic impact model to reflect that change; and the developer, if he wishes to pursue the proposed project, shall be required to repeat the entire analysis and evaluation process, and shall have no vested rights as a result of the expired determination.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-1999; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-1999)
Sec. 1209. - Appeals and variances.
If a developer wishes to appeal any decision that is made in administering this ordinance, or wishes to request a variance from the requirements of any portion of this ordinance, that appeal or variance shall be made in accordance with Article XIII of the Land Development Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 724, 11-4-1999; Ord. No. 725, 11-4-1999)
