Policies regarding purging of uncollectible debts in the county tax records and making of adjustments as to the assessed taxes, penalties, and interest due on county tax accounts are as follows:
(1)
County tax debts will be considered uncollectible under the following circumstances:
a.
Where collection of said debt is barred by the statute of limitations.
b.
Where said debt arises from a tax on real property, and an owner other than the named taxpayer has owned the property for more than four years.
c.
Where said debt arises from a tax on personal property, and an owner other than the named taxpayer has owned the property for more than two years.

Where said debt is evidenced by duplicate or erroneous bills that have not been properly processed.
f.
Any other debt which the tax commissioner reasonably believes to be uncollectible.
(2)
All debts that are determined to be uncollectible under subsection (1) of this section will be compiled into an insolvency list by the tax commissioner. This list will be delivered from time to time and at least once a year to the board of assessors for review. The board of assessors will then submit a list of debts which have been properly identified as uncollectible to the board of commissioners for approval and placement in the minute book so as to authorize the purging of such uncollectible debts from the tax commissioner's digest.
(3)
All other adjustments on debts which do not qualify as uncollectible will be submitted by the tax commissioner or the board of assessors to the board of commissioners with the recommendation of such officers as to the relief to be granted. Each such request shall be accompanied by a sufficient statement of circumstances so as to convey the reasons for the requested adjustment. The board of commissioners will authorize any such relief as is reasonable under the circumstances.

Bonds may be offered for sale at a single rate of interest, or bidders may be requested to name a single rate of interest, but no proposal shall be considered which offers to pay less than the principal amount of bonds offered for sale or which names a rate of interest higher than the lowest rate of interest stated in any legally acceptable proposal. As between proposals naming the same lowest rate of interest, the proposal offering to accept the least amount of bonds shall be accepted, the bonds to be accepted shall be those first maturing, and as between such proposals, the proposal offering to pay the greatest premium bid for the bonds shall in no event exceed $1,000.00 for the principal amount of bonds offered for sale.

6.
Additional terms or conditions of sale may be established by the board of commissioners.
7.
Sale of bonds at one time or in installments. Any issue of bonds may be sold at one time or in installments at different times. The maturities of an installment of bonds offered for sale, when combined with all maturities of the issue previously sold, shall be such as to comply with requirements as to maturities of a single issue of bonds. Any unsold part of an issue or installment may be sold notwithstanding that the maturities thereof, when considered alone, do not comply with such requirements.
