DIVISION 440. - RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 440-000. - Overlay district.
A.
This overlay district is supplemental to the zoning district classifications established in the Newton County Zoning Ordinance. All development and building permits for lots located within this overlay district shall meet all of the requirements of the base zoning district in which it is located and, in addition, shall meet the requirements of the overlay district applicable to the lot.
B.
This overlay district may only be applied within the multi-county mixed-use business park district pursuant to section 285-010.
C.
In any case where the standards and requirements of the overlay district conflict with those of the base zoning district, the standards and requirements of the overlay district shall govern and conflicting standards of the base district shall be void.
Sec. 440-010. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose and intent of the board of commissioners in establishing the residential neighborhood development overlay district is to establish a zoning district classification which promotes the public health, safety, and general welfare by permitting greater flexibility in site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than lot-by-lot regulation, consistent with the policies and intent of the Newton County Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance. A residential neighborhood development overlay district is intended to encourage:
1.
A quality residential environment in close proximity to a major employment center;
2.
More diversity in residential patterns;
3.
Creativeness and innovation in land planning;
4.
Quality development of attractive and cohesive design;
5.
Respect for natural resources and environmental constraints;
6.
Conservation of open space;
7.
Provision of adequate public facilities and services; and
8.
Amenities to serve the recreational, educational, and social needs of residents in order to create a more self-sufficient community.
Sec. 440-020. - Principal uses and structures.
1.
Principal uses and structures allowed in the residential neighborhood development overlay district shall be authorized in the table below.

Sec. 440-030. - General requirements.
Developments within the residential neighborhood development overlay district shall satisfy the following requirements:
A.
The proposed residential neighborhood development district accomplishes, by the use of permitted flexibility and variation in design, a development that has a greater net benefit to the county than that resulting from conventional development. Net benefit to the county may be demonstrated by one or more of the following factors:
1.
Inclusion of a variety of residential uses appropriate within the mixed-use business park district;
2.
Creation of a community of compact scale and design, which encourages pedestrian circulation;
3.
Creation of a design featuring amenities and accessory uses that increases the energy efficiency and self-sufficiency of the neighborhood with respect to its use of single-occupant automobiles without undermining the basic residential character of the neighborhood. Community facilities and accessory commercial uses are so located as to be readily accessible to residents of the community;
4.
Interconnected usable open space;
5.
Recreation facilities;
6.
Other public facilities;
7.
Aesthetic features and harmonious design.
B.
The proposed use would not substantially alter or adversely affect nearby property values.
C.
The site plan for the proposed use provides for adequate ingress and egress of vehicular traffic and would not create safety, health or unreasonable traffic problems in the area.
D.
There are adequate provisions for community facilities such as water, sewer, recreation, and open space.
E.
The residential neighborhood development district results in fewer burdens on present and projected public services and utilities than would result from conventional subdivision development.

Major modifications requested by the applicant/developer after approval of the board of commissioners require that the application or approved plan shall be treated as amendments to the ordinance.
Sec. 440-080. - Relation of residential neighborhood development overlay district to subdivision or other regulations.
All state and federal regulations apply to development with the residential neighborhood development overlay district. It is the intent of these regulations to provide greater flexibility with respect to typical zoning standards regarding setbacks, buffers, and yards. Other conflicts between these regulations and land subdivision requirements contained in the Newton County Development Regulations are unintentional and shall be interpreted by the planning director. When, in the judgment of the planning director, no clear interpretation is possible, the stricter standard shall apply.
