DIVISION 236. - MSR MIXED-USE SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 236-010. - Purpose and intent.
The MSR Mixed-Use Single-Family Residential District is composed of medium- to high-density residential developments of ten acres or more, along with other areas with special considerations where it has been shown that existing land use has included diverse types of single-family dwellings, including manufactured and industrial housing and smaller dwelling units. The intent of this district is to provide areas in which manufactured homes can be intermingled with site-built homes. Such development is encouraged along existing public facilities, but provisions are made for areas which require individual wells and/or septic tanks. The district is not designed to be used for individual lots with manufactured homes, and such zoning is prohibited.

Principal uses and structures shall be allowed in the MSR Mixed-Use Single-Family Residential District in accordance with division 505 of this ordinance.
Sec. 236-030. - Accessory uses and structures.
Accessory uses and structures shall be permitted in the MSR Mixed-Use Single-Family Residential District in accordance with division 510-020(C) of this ordinance.
Sec. 236-040. - Conditional uses.
