DIVISION 460. - SALEM ROAD OVERLAY DISTRICT

Sec. 460-010. - Application of district.
A.
The Salem Overlay District ("overlay") lies in the vicinity of the Salem Road Corridor from the Rockdale County line south to Highway 81. The individual parcels included can be seen in the map entitled "Newton County Salem Overlay District Tiers" contained in Appendix A, incorporated herein by reference thereto.
B.
Except as otherwise provided, any new structures constructed in the overlay are subject to the regulations contained herein.
C.
Existing structures are not subject to these regulations except to the extent required by section 460-120.
D.
Except as otherwise stated herein, in any case where the standards and requirements of the overlay conflict with those of the remainder of the zoning ordinance, the standards and requirements of the overlay shall govern.
(Ord. No. O-031913, exh. A(460-010), 3-19-2013)
Sec. 460-020. - Purpose and intent.
A.
In order to create a more livable and walkable Salem Road area, the overlay encourages the creation of clusters of close-knit growth that keep the small town charm of Newton County. The overlay also intends to focus development around the intersection of Salem Road and Brown Bridge Road and the intersection of Salem Road and Kirkland Road as envisioned in the 2050 Plan and the comprehensive plan. By focusing quality development within the overlay, the overlay sets the stage for preserving farmland and open space elsewhere in the county. These standards regulate the overlay area so that it can be attractive to both new and current residents and result in an area that provides jobs as well as quality of life.
(Ord. No. O-031913, exh. A(460-020), 3-19-2013)
Sec. 460-030. - Uses and structures.
A.
Tier planning and map. In order to address the purpose and goals of the overlay, the overlay is divided into individual tiers which represent the different variations in use within the overlay. Tier 1 contains predominantly residential uses with appropriate neighborhood commercial uses to promote walkability. Tier 2 is a moderate commercial area that provides for mixed-use development and less intense commercial uses. Tier 3 is primarily a more intense commercial area that promotes mixed-use development and features that encourage walkable development. The historic district is intended to protect historic areas in the overlay from development pressure. The designation of tiers within the overlay can be viewed in the map entitled "Newton County Salem Overlay District Tiers."
B.
Uses.

  C.
Sidewalk requirements.
1.
Sidewalks are required on both sides of all streets, except alleys, for all developments within the overlay in accordance with the requirements of the road standards table.
2.
A pedestrian path at least five feet wide must be provided between the front entrance of the building and the nearest public sidewalk. Clearly marked pedestrian crossings shall be provided across any vehicular travel lane.
D.
Access management. The following access management policies are intended to reduce traffic within the overlay. All techniques described below shall be consistent with section 605-100 of Newton County Development Regulations.
1.
Traffic signals. Traffic signals shall be installed where curb cuts or new roads are connected to Salem Road and Brown Bridge Road, subject to submittal of a signal warrant analysis and a traffic study and review and approval of the county engineer and Georgia Department of Transportation.
2.
Curb cuts. The consolidation of curb cuts shall be required and new curb cuts shall be discouraged whenever appropriate, considering safe traffic flow, the objectives of the overlay, and access points needed for the proper functioning of the use. A traffic analysis including consideration of the proposed trip generation (in accordance with ITE Trip Generation Manual, latest edition) shall be required. A traffic study may be required by the county engineer if the traffic analysis indicates that a full traffic study is necessary, and approval of the county engineer, director, and Georgia Department of Transportation shall be obtained for any new curb cuts on Salem Road. For parcels that abut Salem Road, side streets are encouraged for main access points.
a.
The optimal distance between curb cuts shall be determined by design speed as shown in the curb cut spacing table (except along state routes, which shall follow the Georgia Department of Transportation's Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control Manual). Where the speed differs on different sides of the street, the higher speed shall govern. Minimum distances are measured between the centers of each intersection.

50 mph+ 350' 275'
Note: Minimum distances are measured between the centers of each intersection
  b.
Where new curb cuts are requested that do not meet the minimum spacing requirements, property owners shall pursue the use of shared driveways and cross-access drives with adjacent properties instead of an additional curb cut. If the director determines based on documentation of a good faith effort that such action is not feasible, a written exception may be given.
c.
Where possible new curb cuts on one side of the street shall align with existing or proposed curb cuts on the opposite side of the street.
3.
Joint driveways. To allow appropriate access to parcels within the overlay while minimizing curb cuts, the use of joint driveways is required whenever possible as determined by the director per section 460-050(D)2.b. Driveways shall be constructed near the edge of the property lines to allow for future sharing of driveways. Development adjacent to existing joint driveways or driveways within 20 feet of the property line are required to connect with the existing driveways provided the existing driveway meets the criteria for safe access in and out of the development and the owners can come to a legal agreement as in section 460-050(D)5.
4.
Cross-access drives. To minimize the number of curb cuts, cross-access drives are required within the overlay. These shall meet the requirements spelled out in the Newton County Development Regulations in addition to providing street trees and sidewalks as noted on the road standard table in [this] section 460-050. Where cross-access drives cannot be connected to adjacent properties, a stub-out shall be provided. Properties constructing access roads adjacent to a property with an existing stub-out must connect to the existing stub-out. Cross-access drives shall be provided behind the primary structure so that they do not interfere with pedestrian connection to the primary structure.
5.
Legal requirements. Both joint driveways and cross-access drives shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Recording of an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint-use driveway and the cross-access drive.
b.
Recording of a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of all affected property owners including access roads and signage.
E.
Block standards on new streets.
1.
All developments with more than 600 feet of frontage along a single street shall be divided by streets into blocks having a maximum length of 600 feet as measured from street curb to street curb.
2.
Any block exceeding 400 feet in length shall include a dedicated alley or lane providing through access. See Figure 1 for clarification.
F.

No lighting shall be permissible on top or on the side of the pump island canopy.
6.
Mechanical equipment.
a.
Mechanical structures shall be screened from view using landscaping, fencing or berms as approved by the Newton County Landscape Architect. Mechanical equipment, including air conditioner units, may not penetrate the front façade. Screening shall be as required in section 460-050(N).
b.
Mechanical and roof-mounted equipment shall be screened from view by a decorative parapet, cornice, or penthouse that is at least the same height as the equipment to be screened. An administrative variance may be granted by the director if a scale drawing demonstrating that no part of the equipment shall be visible from the edge of right-of-way furthest from the building is submitted.
7.
Awnings and canopies.
a.
Awnings, canopies or other type of covered projected entry if used shall be extended a minimum of five feet from the face of the building. If arcades are used, the minimum width shall be six feet between the inside of the columns to the building, or as approved by the fire marshal.

b.
Barbed wire, razor wire, and unclad chain link fence are permissible only if not visible from any public street or an adjacent residential use.
9.
Auto-oriented uses. Though auto-oriented uses such as gas stations and drive-through windows are a necessary part of the overlay, they should not disproportionally detract from the pedestrian environment.
