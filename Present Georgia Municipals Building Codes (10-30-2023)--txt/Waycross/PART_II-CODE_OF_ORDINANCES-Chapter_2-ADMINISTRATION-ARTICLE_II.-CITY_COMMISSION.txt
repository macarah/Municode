(a)
Regular meetings. The city commission shall meet in regular session twice a month on the first and third Tuesdays of each month at 5:00 p.m. and shall be held in the commission chambers located in the city hall unless otherwise provided by resolution and approved by the commission.
(b)
Special called meetings. The mayor of the commission, any member thereof, or the city manager may call special meetings of the commission at any time when deemed that public business demands it. All called meetings shall be held in the commission chambers located in the city hall unless otherwise provided by resolution and approved by the commission.
(c)
Open to public. All meetings at which official actions may be taken shall be open to the public and shall be held in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq.
(d)
Work sessions. Work sessions shall be held at 5:00 p.m. on the Monday before the regular commission meetings held on the first and third Tuesday of each month unless otherwise provided by resolution and approved by the commission. Work sessions prior to a special called meeting may be held if requested by at least three members of the commission. The mayor of the commission, any member thereof, or the city manager may call a special work session of the commission at any time when deemed that public business demands it; however, no formal votes shall be taken. All work sessions shall be held in the commission chambers located in the city hall unless otherwise provided by resolution and approved by the commission.
Work sessions provide members the opportunity to meet with city staff in order to delve into complex issues, discuss solutions and alternatives, give direction to city manager, finalize agendas, or create consent agendas. Pre-meeting work sessions may be used by commissioners to prepare for upcoming regular, formal meetings. These meetings are typically more casual in tone, are often used for information gathering, and no formal votes are taken. These work sessions shall not be televised on Waycross Area Television Service (WAYX) unless provided by resolution and approved by the commission. However, pre-meeting work sessions are subject to the open meetings law.

The mayor, or the mayor pro tem in the absence of the mayor, shall enforce these rules of decorum.
