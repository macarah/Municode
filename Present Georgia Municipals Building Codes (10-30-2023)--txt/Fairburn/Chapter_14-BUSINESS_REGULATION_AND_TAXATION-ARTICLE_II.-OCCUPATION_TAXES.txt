Sec. 14-39. - Time period for taxation.
(a)
All occupation taxes levied under this article are levied on the amount of business to be transacted during the current calendar year. However, for convenience of both the city and the taxpayer, each business subject to the occupation tax levied herein, on or before the dates hereinafter set forth, file with the city administrator the return hereinafter specifically provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payments on the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with the final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.
(b)
The owner, proprietor, manager, or executive officer of the business subject to said occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year, and on or before March 1 of the current calendar year, file with the city administrator, on a form furnished by said city administrator, a signed return setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year. This return will be used to determine the final tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupation tax for the current year.
(c)
Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.
(Code 1966, § 14-19; Ord. No. 94-08, § 1, 10-24-1994; Ord. No. 2013-33, 12-9-2013)

On or before March 1 of each year, the owner, proprietor, manager, or executive officer of the business liable for said occupation tax levied for the year shall file with the city administrator, on a form furnished by the city administrator, a signed return setting forth the actual amount of the gross receipts of such business during the preceding calendar year.
(b)
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year, based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this article, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business, based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 14-39, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city on March 1 of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date.
(c)
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year, based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this article, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business, based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 14-19, the difference in said amount shall be refundable by the city to the taxpayer; or, if said business continues to be conducted in the city during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the city on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the city by said business for the current year. This election is to be taken by the city.
(d)
Refunds. Requests for refunds based on changes in the gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be allowed only for the license year next preceding the time of the request for such refund. No refund or proration shall be made of any regulatory fee or administrative fee and no refund or proration shall be allowed for a taxpayer who shall cease doing business or remove the business from the city.

Failure of the submission of such books, state tax returns or records within thirty (30) days shall be grounds for the imposition of a ten-percent penalty against such person. Adequate records shall be kept in the city for examination by the city and its officers at their discretion. If after examination of the books, state tax returns or records it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under reporting, a penalty of ten percent of the deficiency and an additional 1.5 percent of the deficiency for each month or fraction thereof that the deficiency was past due and unpaid shall be assessed.

In addition to other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the city administrator, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the highest rate allowable under law from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover any property in the county of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, all as provided by the city's Charter and the laws of the state. The occupation tax lien shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the city administrator upon the property of defendant in execution located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs.

If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.
