--- (5) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2012-13, § 1, adopted November 15, 2012, set out provisions intended for as art. XIII, §§ 62-462—62-470. For purposes of clarity, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 62-471—62-478.

Sec. 62-471. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a vacant and foreclosed real property registry as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are vacant or foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure.
(b)
Improperly maintained and unsecure vacant or foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of vacant and foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions of this article.
(c)
This vacant and foreclosed real property registry will require owners to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing the vacant or foreclosed real property into compliance with applicable provisions of state and federal law, and the Code.
(d)
If there is a conflict between the provisions and requirements in this article and state law, as it exists now or may be amended hereafter, then state law shall govern.
