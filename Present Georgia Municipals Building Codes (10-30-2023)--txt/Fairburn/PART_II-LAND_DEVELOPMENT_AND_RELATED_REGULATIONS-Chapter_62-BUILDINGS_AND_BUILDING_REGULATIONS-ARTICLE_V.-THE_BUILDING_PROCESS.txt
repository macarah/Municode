ARTICLE V. - THE BUILDING PROCESS

Sec. 62-141. - Overview.
The building process in the city is divided into two sections: the plan review, permit and inspection process for single-family residential structures; and the plan review, permit and inspection process for commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and multifamily residential structures.
(Ord. No. 2005-21, art. 4, 9-24-2005; Ord. No. 2012-15, ยง 1, 12-10-2012)
Sec. 62-142. - Single-family residential structures.
This section pertains to the construction of single-family detached residential structures on individual zoning lots in the city. Following is a step-by-step outline of the process and the requirements involved in completing this process:
(1)
Step 1: permits. The construction of a single-family residential structure requires two permits:
a.
A site development permit; and
b.
A building construction permit.
As a first step in the permit process, a builder should consult with the permit manager to determine exactly what is required for permit applications, the fees involved, the necessary inspections, and the schedule for the various steps in the process.
(2)
Step 2: application for site development permit. In order to obtain a site development permit, the builder must submit a complete development permit application package to include:
a.
A completed development permit application form;
b.
An accurate and up-to-date boundary survey of the property including location of any floodplain and tree save area;
c.
A complete and accurate site development plan; and
d.
The appropriate plan review, permit and inspection fees.
(3)
Step 3: incomplete packages; resubmittal. Upon submittal, the permit manager shall determine whether or not the package is complete. If it is not complete, it shall be returned to the builder with instructions as to what needs to be done to complete it, and it must then be resubmitted at a later date. This determination shall be made by the permit manager within two working days of the submittal. There is no charge for a resubmittal at this time.
(4)
Step 4: review by development staff. If it is determined that the package is complete, it shall be officially accepted for staff review, the date of acceptance shall be noted, and the package shall be promptly distributed to the development staff. The development staff shall have ten working days to review the package and make a determination as to whether or not a site development permit will be issued.
(5)
Step 5: denial of site development permit; resubmittal. If a decision is made that a site development permit cannot be issued, the permit manager shall promptly notify the builder, and provide the builder with the reasons for the decision and an explanation of what will need to be done to correct any deficiencies. There will be a charge for any resubmittal at this time.
(6)
Step 6: issuance of site development permit. If the site development permit application package is approved, the permit manager will issue a site development permit authorizing the initial construction activities on the site.
(7)
Step 7: initial inspection. Upon issuance of a site development permit, a builder shall first install any required tree-save fence and erosion control facilities, and have that installation inspected and approved by the development inspector. This initial site inspection shall be done within two working days of the builder's request. Work on subsequent phases of the construction cannot proceed until this initial inspection is approved. From this point on, the development inspector shall inspect the site on a regular basis in order to assure that the development of the site is proceeding in accordance with the approved site development plan. If at any time the development inspector determines that work is not being done in accordance with the approved plan, he shall take the appropriate enforcement actions to possibly include a stop work order, citations, and/or a cash bond.
(8)
Step 8: application for building construction permit. After a site development permit is issued, a builder may then apply for a building construction permit. An application package for a building construction permit shall include:
a.
A completed building construction permit application form;
b.
A complete set of plans and specifications for the proposed structure; and
c.
The appropriate permit and inspection fee.
(9)
Step 9: review by permit manager and building official. The permit manager and the building official shall review the building construction permit application package within five working days of its submittal and either approve it or return it to the builder with the reasons for it not being approved along with an explanation of what needs to be done to correct any problems that may exist at this point. If the application package is approved, the building official may then issue a building construction permit for the proposed structure.
(10)
Step 10: site clearing and grading; footing and foundation work. Upon approval of the installation of the tree-save fencing and erosion control facilities, the builder may next proceed with the site clearing and grading, and the initial footing and foundation work. This work will be inspected by the building inspector within two working days of a request for an inspection. If, for any reason a reinspection is required, there will be reinspection fees for that work.
(11)
Step 11: submission of foundation survey. Once the foundation is installed, a builder must have a foundation survey prepared. The foundation survey shall be submitted to the building official for approval. No building construction work shall be allowed to proceed on the site until the building official approves the foundation survey. The building official must either approve the foundation survey or deny approval within two working days. If it is not approved, the builder will be instructed as to what needs to be done to get the necessary approval.
(12)
Step 12: interval inspections and reinspections. Upon approval of the foundation survey, the building inspector shall perform inspections on request at the appropriate construction intervals. These inspections shall be done within two working days of the request. If the building inspector does not approve the work requested for inspection, a reinspection fee shall be charged for a followup inspection. In addition to requested inspections, the building inspector may inspect any construction project at any time.
(13)
Step 13: final building inspection. Upon completion of the structure, the builder shall request a final building inspection, which shall be performed by the building inspector within two working days of the request.
(14)
Step 14: final site inspection. Upon completion of the development of the site, the builder shall request a final site inspection, which shall be done by the development inspector within two working days of the request.
(15)
Step 15: application for certificate of occupancy. Upon approval of the final building inspection and the final site inspection, the builder may request a certificate of occupancy, which shall be issued by the building official within two working days of the request.
(16)
Step 16: issuance of certificate of occupancy. Upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the builder may turn the property over for occupancy for its lawfully intended purpose. Under no circumstances shall a property be occupied prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Citations shall be issued and additional enforcement measures may be employed for any unauthorized occupancy. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy officially marks the end of the single-family residential building process.

Sec. 62-143. - Commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential structures.
This section pertains to the construction of commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and multifamily residential structures in the city. Following is a step-by-step outline of the process for building these structures and the requirements involved in completing the construction process:
(1)
Step 1: review of sketch plan. The first step in the building of a non-single family residential structure should involve the preparation of a sketch plan of the proposed project and the review of that sketch plan with the planning and zoning coordinator. This will enable the builder to become familiar with the process, the plans that will be involved, the fees, and the necessary inspections. There is no charge for this step in the process.
(2)
Step 2: preparation of conceptual site plan. Following a review of a sketch plan, the builder shall prepare a conceptual site plan. The purpose of a conceptual site plan is to provide a builder with an economical way to work with the city in reaching a general agreement as to the nature of a proposed project and its conformance with the codes, ordinances and plans of the city. For the conceptual site plan review, a builder will not need detailed architectural and engineering drawings. A conceptual site plan may be drawn at any reasonable scale on a sheet of any reasonable size; however, it does need to be clearly and accurately drawn by a design professional, and, as a minimum, the following information should be provided:
a.
An accurate, up-to-date and certified survey of the property on which the project is to be built.
b.
A vicinity map showing the property in relation to the general area of the city in which it is located.
c.
The name of the proposed project.
d.
Name, address, phone number, and fax number of the owner, the developer and the designer who prepared the plan.
e.
Graphic scale, north arrow, and date of preparation.
f.
Zoning of the property with required setbacks shown.
g.
Zoning, use, and ownership of all adjoining property.
h.
Total area of the site, and the area of the site proposed to be devoted to impervious surfaces.
i.
Approximate topography of the site.
j.
Significant natural features on and adjacent to the site, including the 100-year floodplain, if appropriate.
k.
Existing manmade features on the site.
l.
Proposed site layout including buildings, drives, parking, walkways, landscaped-areas, tree save areas, buffers, easements, utilities and any other features necessary to properly present the concept.
m.
Proposed off-site improvements which may be necessary to properly develop the site.
n.
Architectural elevations to show the intended architectural character of the proposed building and the nature of the materials to be used.
o.
If the site plan is for an addition to or a change in an existing site plan, the drawings must clearly show the changes that are being proposed.
(3)
Step 3: submission of conceptual site plan; review standards. Ten full-size copies and one 11-inch by 17-inch copy of the conceptual site plan shall be submitted to the planning and zoning coordinator, who shall promptly note the date of submittal and distribute the plan for staff review. The planning and zoning coordinator will be responsible for assuring conformance with the zoning ordinance set forth in chapter 80, the subdivision regulations set forth in chapter 77, and the GA74 Overlay Ordinance, if applicable. The city engineer will be responsible for the technical review of the plans and specifications, and the fire marshal will be responsible for the fire safety aspects of the submittal.
(4)
Step 4: review of conceptual site plan by city staff. The staff shall have ten working days after submittal to complete the review of the conceptual site plan, and notify the builder of the staff conclusions and recommendations. If it is approved by the staff, it shall be scheduled for review by the planning commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting at which it can be put on the agenda. If it is not approved, it shall be returned to the applicant with the reasons for disapproval and an explanation of what needs to be done to secure approval. A resubmittal fee will be required, and the applicant will need to repeat steps 2 and 3, set forth in subsections (2) and (3).
(5)
Step 5: report and recommendations by staff. The staff shall prepare a report for the planning and zoning commission which explains the proposed project and make recommendations as to whether the conceptual site plan should be approved, and, if so, what conditions should be included with that approval.
(6)
Step 6: review by planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission shall take action on the proposed conceptual site plan. If it is approved, the builder can proceed with the next step in the process. If it is not approved, the builder may begin the process over again starting with step 2, set forth in subsection (2), and a new fee will be required.
(7)
Step 7: permits required. Upon approval of the conceptual site plan by the planning and zoning commission, the builder may prepare the necessary plans and specifications for the construction of the building. These are divided into two separate submittals:
a.
The first submittal is for a site development permit; and
b.
The second is for a building construction permit.
(8)
Step 8: application for site development permit. The submittal for a site development permit shall include the following materials:
a.
A completed site development permit application form;
b.
Ten complete sets of the site development plans and specifications to include:
1.
A copy of the approved conceptual site plan with a copy of any conditions the mayor and council may require;
2.
A site layout plan;
3.
A grading plan;
4.
A utilities plan;
5.
A drainage plan;
6.
An erosion and sedimentation control plan;
7.
Engineering details as necessary;
8.
Tree protection plan; and
9.

f.
A hydrological study and such other studies and reports as may be required by the city engineer and fire marshal; and
g.
The appropriate plan review and inspection fees.
All plans shall be drawn at a reasonable scale on sheets of a reasonable size. All plans must be clearly and accurately drawn by a design professional licensed to practice in the state. All plan sheets must be signed and sealed by the professional who prepared the plans.
(9)
Step 9: application for building construction permit. The submittal for a building construction permit shall include the following materials:
a.
A completed building construction permit application form;
b.
Five complete sets of the architectural plans and specifications prepared by a professional architect registered in the state; and
c.
The appropriate permit and inspection fees.
(10)
Step 10: review of application for site development permit. The city engineer has ten working days from the date of submittal to review the site development plans and specifications in order to make a determination as to whether a site development permit will be issued. If it is determined that a permit will not be issued, the builder will be notified of the decision and given an explanation of what will need to be done to secure approval. There will be a charge for resubmittal of the plans.
(11)
Step 11: issuance of site development permit. If the plans and specifications are approved, the city engineer will issue a site development permit authorizing the initial construction activities on the site and the builder will be promptly notified and provided with a set of approved plans. At the same time, the planning and zoning coordinator and development inspector will also be notified of this decision and provided with sets of approved plans.
(12)
Step 12: initial site inspection. Upon issuance of a site development permit, a builder shall first install any required tree-save fence and erosion control facilities, and have that installation inspected and approved by the development inspector. This initial site inspection shall be done within two working days of the builder's request. Work on subsequent phases of the construction cannot proceed until this initial inspection is approved. From this point on, the development inspector shall inspect the site on a regular basis in order to assure that the development of the site is proceeding in accordance with the approved site development plan. If at any time the development inspector determines that work is not being done in accordance with the approved plan, he shall take the appropriate enforcement actions, which may include a stop work order, citations, and/or a cash bond.
(13)
Step 13: issuance of building construction permit. Upon approval of the installation of the tree-save fencing and erosion control facilities by the development inspector, the building official may then issue a building construction permit and shall perform inspections on request at the appropriate construction intervals. These inspections shall be done within two working days of the request. If the building inspector does not approve the work requested for inspection, a reinspection fee shall be charged for a follow-up inspection. In addition to requested inspections, the building inspector may inspect a construction project at any time.
(14)
Step 14: final building inspection. Upon completion of the structure, the builder shall request a final building inspection, which shall be performed by the building inspector within two working days of the request. There will be a charge for any required reinspection.
(15)
Step 15: final site inspection. Upon completion of the site development work, the builder shall request a final site inspection, which shall be performed by the development inspector within two working days of the request. There will be a charge for any required reinspection.
(16)
Step 16: final landscaping inspection. Upon completion of the landscaping work, the builder shall request a final landscaping inspection, which shall be performed by the city landscape architect within five working days of the request. There will be a charge for any required reinspection.
(17)
Step 17: application for certificate of occupancy. Upon final approval of the structure, the site work and the landscaping, the builder may request a certificate of occupancy, which shall be issued by the building official within two working days of the request. The city landscape architect may allow a builder to defer the installation of some of the landscaping materials for climatic reasons or because of limited availability of the material at the time. In the event of a deferral, the builder must post a cash bond in accordance with section 74-39, in order to be eligible for a temporary certificate of occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy will be valid for a specified period of time not to exceed six months, during which time the deferred material must be installed, inspected and approved by the city landscape architect. If this is not completed within six months, the temporary certificate will be revoked and occupancy of the building must be terminated.
(18)
Step 18: issuance of certificate of occupancy. Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the builder may turn the property over for occupancy for its lawfully intended purpose. Under no circumstance shall a property be occupied prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Citations may be issued and additional enforcement measures may be employed for any unauthorized occupancy. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy officially marks the end of the non-single-family residential building process.
