(5)
Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.
(b)
In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft.

If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the utility director, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary.

Sec. 41-113. - The application process.
It is the City of Fairburn's responsibility to require proper documentation for providing service to our citizens in order to collect for this service. Any attempts to apply for service with the City of Fairburn or Fairburn Utilities with altered or suspicious documents should be considered a RED FLAG - the application and all supporting paperwork including lease, identification, etc. should be presented to the utility director for further research before any service may be rendered.
In order to obtain service with Fairburn Utilities, a completed signed application should be submitted with proper supporting documents as follows:
(1)
Application. The application should be completed and signed by the applicant (an "On-Line" application implies a signature). A credit check cannot be obtained without a customer's signature allowing the City of Fairburn to access their credit information. Landlords do not have to complete an application each time they have service turned on at a rental property, but in order to comply with the new regulations, each landlord should have a signed application on file with Fairburn Utilities and be given a customer ID number to reference when they call in for service. This application would apply to any service at any of their rental properties.
(2)
Lease/rental/purchase agreement. We must have a lease/rental agreement or purchase agreement showing who is the legal occupant of the property. Any document that appears to be altered in any way would provide a RED FLAG alert and the paperwork should be brought to the attention of the utility director to be verified. If the landlord does not provide a lease/rental agreement, he must send a landlord verification statement allowing us to provide utility service that must include the following information:
• Property location
• Person(s) leasing/renting the property
• Date the agreement is effective
• Landlord's name and a telephone number where he can be reached if we need to verify the information.
(3)
Picture I.D. An unexpired picture I.D. issued by a state or federal government should be presented at the time of the application process. Forms of identification allowed are:
• State driver's license
• State issued Photo I.D.
• Georgia Voter I.D. Card
• Valid U.S. Military Photo LD.
• Valid U.S. Passport I.D.
• Resident Alien I.D. card (issued by the U.S. Department of Justice - Immigration and Naturalization Services)
(4)
Social Security Number. Fairburn Utilities requires a Social Security Number for identification purposes based on Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Privacy Act of 1974,2004 Edition.
OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974,2004 EDITION (SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER USAGE)
"any disclosure of a social security number to any federal, state, or local agency maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1,1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual.
(b) Any federal, state or local government agency which requests an individual to disclose his social security account number shall inform that individual whether that disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it.
(5)
Before checking credit using "Online Utility Exchange", the city representative should make sure that the application is complete, that it is signed and that it is dated correctly. All fields should be completed, especially the following:
a.
Name. Be sure the name is the same as the name on the lease agreement or purchase agreement. This is the responsible party, not someone listed as living at the residence.
b.
New service location address. Check the new location as follows:
(i)
See what service is needed at the address, i.e. electric, water, etc.
(ii)
Compare the listed landlord with the one on the lease or rental agreement. If they are not the same, this should send up a RED FLAG.
(iii)
Check the previous tenant's account. Service that has been disconnected for non-payment within the last few days should be a RED FLAG.
For any of these RED FLAGS, send the customer to the utility director for further investigation.
c.
Landlord (or owner). The landlord's name and phone number should be on the application. Enter the landlord's customer ID number beside his name. An application must be on file for each landlord if they wish to call in for service. A list of landlords and their customer ID numbers will be kept as a reference. If the landlord does not appear on the list, he must complete an application within ten days or service at his rental property may be disconnected.
d.
Phone number. A phone number should be provided in case we need to reach the customer. This may be a home phone, cell phone or work phone if they are allowed calls at work, or any combination.
e.
Current address (or previous address if already moved). If the address that they are moving from does not agree with any address on credit reports (reports may have previous addresses listed in the near future), then this should send up a RED FLAG. If a RED FLAG is raised, send the applicant to the utility director.
f.
Social Security number. A Social Security number is required for utility service with the Fairburn Utilities pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. This is a requirement listed on the application and is necessary. Without a Social Security number we cannot prove identity and we cannot collect the debt.
Anyone legally working in the United States (Citizen or Non-Citizen) may obtain a Social Security number for tax reporting purposes. When we run the credit inquiry, a Social Security number that does not match the name (RED FLAG) or that displays alerts (RED FLAG) of any kind should be sent to the utility director for further research.
g.
Driver's license number. This should be the I.D. number on an unexpired state or government issued picture I.D. Look at the customer and make sure they are the same person who is applying for service. If they do not look like the picture on the I.D. or if the I.D. has been altered (RED FLAG), send to the utility director.
h.
Date of birth. Check the picture ID to see if the date of birth agrees with the date they put on the application.
1.
If the person does not appear to be the age they claim to be (RED FLAG), send to the utility director.
2.
If the date of birth on the application does not match the date of birth on the picture ID (RED FLAG), send to the utility director.
3.
If the date of birth on any credit report does not match the application or picture ID (RED FLAG), send to the utility director.
i.
Current employer. The employer field should never be left blank. If the customer does not work, they should put none, n/a, retired, SSI, baby sit, etc.
If they work for a temporary agency, i.e. Kelly Services or Westaff, that should be their employer, not the plant or office where they perform their job. If in question, ask who pays them.
j.
Signature of customer. No credit inquiry can be run if the application is not signed by the customer. No one else can sign the customer's name unless they have a "Power of Attorney" and a copy of the "Power of Attorney" should be attached to the application.
k.
Date. The date on the application should match the date on the Credit Bureau inquiry. Also, the date may be very important in years to come by matching the date the application was submitted with the date service was provided. Always check the date and be sure the applicant put the correct date, especially the year, on the application.
