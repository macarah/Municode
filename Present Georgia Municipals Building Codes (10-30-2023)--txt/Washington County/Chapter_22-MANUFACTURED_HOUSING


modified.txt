Sec. 22-20. - Penalty.
Any person violating the provisions of this article shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and upon the conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law. Each day on continued violation shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. No. WC-47, § 8, 8-13-1981)
Sec. 22-21. - Permit and decal required; conditions to be satisfied.
(a)
Payment of taxes. Prior to a mobile home or manufactured home being transported into the county, or relocated, or located into Washington County, a permit to transport must be obtained from the tax assessor and a decal showing payment of taxes must be obtained from the tax commissioner. Both items are required for such transport, location or relocation of such home in the county. Transporting or relocating or locating a mobile home or manufactured home without first obtaining such permit and decal is a violation of this article, and is punishable as permitted by this Code.
(b)
Water and sewage system approval. Before a permit to transport and a decal showing taxes paid shall be issued for the location or relocation of a mobile home or manufactured home within the limits of the county, applicant must first submit to the tax assessor and the tax commissioner of the county, proof that the county board of health has approved the individual water system and the individual sewage system used or to be used in connection with said mobile home or manufactured home. This section shall not apply as to renewal permits, provided there has been no relocation of the mobile home or manufactured home since the last permit was issued.
(c)
Certification of occupancy. Prior to the issuance of a permit by the tax assessor for transport, relocation, or location, the homeowner, landlord, or transporter must submit a certification from a certified home inspector, certifying that the mobile home or manufactured home meets minimum occupancy and safety standards. No permit will issue unless said certification is presented at the time of application. If however the mobile home to be transported is new, purchased from a manufacturer, then a receipt of such new purchase will suffice in place of a certification of occupancy and safety.
(1)
Home inspectors with credentials from ASHI or GAHI will be accepted as certified home inspectors.
(2)
Minimum occupancy and safety standards shall mean at a minimum that the home is structurally sound and the plumbing and electrical systems are sound.
(3)
The county will provide forms for applicant to be executed either by a manufacturer, dealer, or home inspector, as appropriate.
