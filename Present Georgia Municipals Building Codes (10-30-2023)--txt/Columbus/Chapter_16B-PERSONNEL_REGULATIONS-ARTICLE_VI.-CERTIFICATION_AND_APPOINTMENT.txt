Sec. 16B-6-2. - Anticipation of need.
Insofar as possible, vacancies shall be anticipated sufficiently in advance to permit the personnel officer to establish an eligible list. If a new class is necessary, sufficient time shall be allowed for the preparation of a new class specification and to have the position classification and pay plans amended as provided by pertinent Charter provisions and these regulations.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 2, 8-17-71)
Sec. 16B-6-3. - Method of filling vacancies.
Vacancies may be filled by transfer, demotion, or certification from preferred reemployment lists, promotional lists, general reemployment lists or employment lists.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 3, 8-17-71)
Sec. 16B-6-4. - Order of lists for certification.
Usually eligibles shall be certified from lists in the order named as follows: Preferred reemployment list, promotional list, general reemployment list and employment list, unless for the good of the service the personnel officer elects to change the order.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 4, 8-17-71)
Sec. 16B-6-5. - Number of names to be certified.
The personnel officer shall certify the top three names from an eligible list as provided in section 16B-6-4 above. If more than one vacancy exists, the number certified shall be equal to the number of vacancies plus two.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 5, 8-17-71)
Sec. 16B-6-6. - Appropriate eligible lists.
Certification shall ordinarily be made from a list established for the particular class in which the vacancy exists. However, if no such list exists or the list contains an insufficient number of eligibles for certification purposes, the personnel officer may at his discretion certify names from an appropriate eligible list if such a list is available. Such a list shall be for a class of the same or higher pay level with the qualification requirements equal to or superior to the class in which the vacancy exists.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 6, 8-17-71)
Sec. 16B-6-7. - Temporary appointments.
(a)
Temporary appointments for short term employment in positions that will not continue longer than six months in any 12-month period shall be made from eligible lists, if such lists exist. If no list exists or if certification from lists is impracticable because of nonavailability of eligibles for temporary work, the personnel officer may authorize the appointing authority to recommend persons of his own choosing. The personnel officer will review the recommended applicants and certify those meeting at least the minimum qualifications established for the class of position to the appointing authority for appointment.
(b)
Temporary appointment may be made to fill vacant higher budgeted positions vacated by employees on sick leave by lower grade employees, without pay for the higher position, for periods of time not to exceed 90 consecutive calendar days during any 12 month period. If it should become necessary to retain an employee over 90 consecutive calendar days in the higher budgeted position, action will be taken to start paying the lower grade employee on the first day following the completion of the 90 days and he will continue to receive the higher rate until the incumbent returns to duty.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 7, 8-17-71; Ord. No. 74-78, § 1, 4-16-74; Ord. No. 75-20, § 10, 3-18-75)
Sec. 16B-6-8. - Emergency appointments.
When an emergency involving the serious impairment of the public business makes it impossible to fill a position under the merit system by the normal procedure, the appointing authority, subject to the approval of the personnel officer, may appoint any qualified person to such position in order to prevent stoppage of public business or loss, or serious inconvenience to the public. Any such person shall be employed only during such emergency and for a period not to exceed 30 days. A vacancy of which the appointing authority has had a reasonable notice, or an employment condition of which he had, or might with due diligence have had, previous knowledge, shall not be considered an emergency under this section. Within ten days of the date of an emergency, the appointing authority involved shall justify the emergency in writing to the satisfaction of the personnel officer. Emergencies which may be reasonably anticipated by an appointing authority shall be justified in writing in advance to the satisfaction of the personnel officer. Improper emergency appointments within the classified service shall be terminated by the personnel officer as he deems advisable.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 8, 8-17-71)

A provisional appointment shall continue only until an appropriate eligible list may be established and certification made therefrom.
(c)
In no event shall a provisional appointment continue for more than 90 days in any 12-month period.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 9, 8-17-71; Ord. No. 75-20, § 11, 3-18-75)
Sec. 16B-6-10. - Limited term appointments.
Vacancies created by a military leave of absence without pay shall be filled by a limited term appointment by certification from an eligible list in the same manner as is used for other appointments. A person holding a limited term appointment may be terminated when the person he is replacing returns to the position. Transfer from limited term to permanent status may be made if the person being replaced fails to return on the termination of his leave. Except for the limited nature of their status, employees holding limited term appointments shall have the same rights and privileges as permanent employees.
(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 10, 8-17-71)
Sec. 16B-6-11. - Part-time positions.

(Ord. No. 71-213, Ch. 6, § 11, 8-17-71; Ord. No. 72-75, 5-2-72)
