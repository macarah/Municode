Editor's note— Ord. No. 71-210, adopted Aug. 17, 1971, was enacted as adding Ch. 13D to this Code. However, to preserve the alphabetical format of chapter titles, the ordinance was codified as Ch. 13B, Ch. 13B was renumbered as Ch. 13C, and Ch. 13C was renumbered as Ch. 13D. The ordinance is set out as enacted, including the catchlines and numbering system; however, the section numbers were prefixed with the chapter number, and the word "ordinance" was changed to "chapter" by the editors, to preserve established Code format.
