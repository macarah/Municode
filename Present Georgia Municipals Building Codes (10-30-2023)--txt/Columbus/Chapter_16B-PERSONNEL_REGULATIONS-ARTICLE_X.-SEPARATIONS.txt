Sec. 16B-10-1. - Resignation.
To resign in good standing an employee should give, in writing, his division head, department head or appointing authority at least 14 calendar days' prior notice. Normally, failure to comply with this rule shall be entered on the service record of the employee, shall result in a denial of reemployment rights and shall result in a reduction of accumulated annual leave by one day for each calendar day less than the required 14 days' notice. However, the department head or appointing authority, with the approval of the personnel officer, may exempt from any or all of these penalties an employee who has given less than the required notice if, in his judgment, exceptional circumstances warrant such exemption.

If the disability is correctable, the employee shall be allowed a specified time as determined by the personnel officer to have it corrected. If he fails to take steps to have the disability corrected within this specified time, he shall be subject to disciplinary action or lay-off.
