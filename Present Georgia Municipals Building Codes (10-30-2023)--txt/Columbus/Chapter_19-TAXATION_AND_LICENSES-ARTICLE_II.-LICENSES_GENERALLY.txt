Sec. 19-20. - Revocation of licenses of businesses in repeated violation of ordinances.
(a)
Wherever the Columbus, Georgia Code does not otherwise provide for revocation of licenses to conduct business issued by the Consolidated Government, the following procedures for revocation are established for repeated violations of ordinances governing the operations of said businesses: Columbus Council, on the recommendation of one or more enforcement officials, is authorized to revoke the business licenses of those businesses in which owners or managers or other agents have been found guilty of or pled guilty or nolo contendere in recorder's court or any other court to one or more violations on two or more separate occasions of the provisions of ordinances governing the operations of businesses within a one-year period preceding said recommendation, and the failure to appear at two or more separate hearings for one or more citations shall be treated as two or more violations on two or more separate occasions; the revocation by the council shall be effective for two years following the date of its action, and no renewal of a revoked business license shall be made during this period and until all violations are corrected.
(b)
A recommendation for revocation and the reasons therefor shall be written and signed by the enforcement official or officials and filed with the clerk of council who shall upon receipt thereof forward the same by written correspondence to the licensee; said notification shall set a time and date for a hearing of the recommendation by the Columbus Council which shall be at a regular meeting scheduled on a date at least two weeks from the date of mailing by the clerk.
(c)
At the revocation hearing the license holder and the enforcement official or officials and any other interested persons or witnesses to relevant evidence will be heard; but a certified copy of the judicial record of a conviction or plea shall be prima facie evidence of the violations underlying the recommendation for revocation, and the determination of the Columbus Council on the issue of revocation will focus on the number of violations and the flagrancy or damage to the public interest indicated by their factual circumstances.
(d)
No license shall be revoked until a majority vote of the mayor and council decides at the time of or subsequent to the hearing that said revocation is warranted because the past failure of the business or its agents to comply with the provisions of the ordinances regulating the business constitutes a deliberate indifference to compliance; nevertheless, the unexplained or unmitigated evidence of at least two violations within one year of the recommendation for revocation shall constitute sufficient grounds for a finding of deliberate indifference.
