The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof become delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the revenue collection officer upon the property of defendant located in Columbus, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs.
