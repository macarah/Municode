ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

FOOTNOTE(S):
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-01-02, adopted Jan. 6, 2009, was not specifically amendatory. At the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 10-61—10-83.
Sec. 10-61. - Findings regarding necessity for adult entertainment.
(a)
Based on the experience of other local governmental jurisdictions recognizing that the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments produces increased criminal activity and deterioration of adjacent neighborhoods, Turner County finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the county also finds that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.
(b)
The county has again reviewed and considered problems that other counties have experienced as a result of adult entertainment establishments operating within those jurisdictions. The county, in reaffirming this article, has no intention to infringe upon the rights of any citizens to freedom of speech or expression.
(c)
The United States Supreme Court, in Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976), held that adult entertainment uses are subject to carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts, and that zoning can legitimately be utilized to regulate such uses by establishing zones where adult entertainment uses are most compatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood, or by requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult uses and other uses.
(d)
The United States Supreme Court, in City of Renton v. Playtime Theater, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that a local government may rely on the experience of other jurisdictions in enacting legislation to regulate adult entertainment uses.
(e)
The commissioners have considered and are mindful of the harmful secondary effects caused by adult entertainment uses as discussed in numerous judicial opinions, including but not limited to the following:
(1)
Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Florida, 490 F.3d 860 (11th Circuit, 2007);
(2)
5634 East Hillsborough Avenue, Inc. v. Hillsborough County, Florida, Case No. 8:06-cv-1695-T-26EAJ, Middle District of Florida;
(3)
Peek-a-Boo Lounge of Bradenton, Inc. v. Manatee County, Florida, 337 F.3d 1251 (11th Circuit, 2003);
(4)
Zibtluda, LLC v. Gwinnett County, Georgia, 411 F.3d 1278 (11th Circuit, 2007); and
(5)
Chambers d/b/a Neon Cowboy v. Peach County, Georgia, 266 Ga. 318 (1996).
