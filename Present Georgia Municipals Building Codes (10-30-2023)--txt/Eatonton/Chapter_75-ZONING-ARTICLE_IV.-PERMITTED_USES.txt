(1)
Generally. The purpose of this section is to encourage the unified and harmonious improvement of land and buildings under a unified plan of development rather than under conventional lot-by-lot regulations. The city benefits from variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. The developer benefits from better land use, economy in development and flexibility in design. Review of the development plan by the planning and development department provides an opportunity to ensure that the development will be in harmony with in which it is located.
a.
Ownership control. All of the land in a planned development initially shall be in single ownership by an individual, a partnership, tenants in common, a corporation or by some other legal entity. However, this shall not preclude several contiguous property owners from making a joint application for a planned development. Individual properties in a planned development may only be sold after a final plat has been approved and recorded with the properties, subject to private deed covenants that ensure the continuance of the planned development as originally approved and developed, or as otherwise provided in this section.
b.
Sewer and water requirements.

c.
Exempt from conventional development standards. Planned developments shall be exempt from the conventional development standards of this chapter. The provisions of this section shall govern their approval.
d.
Common use restrictions through covenant and declaration requirements. When a planned development requires the creation of a property owner's association to govern the use of common open space or other common areas, the required covenants, declaration and restrictions shall be filed with the clerk of superior court and, as a minimum, shall provide for: Mandatory and automatic membership in the property owners' association as a function of home or dwelling unit ownership; creation of the property owners' association before any individual properties are sold; all owners to have equal access and right of use to all shared and common facilities; perpetual and continued maintenance of open and shared space; tax liability in the case of default; the method of assessment for dues, maintenance and related costs; and, where appropriate, party wall maintenance and related costs; and restoration in the event of damage or destruction.
e.
Open space improvements. When open space is required to be provided as part of a planned improvement, the developer shall submit with his application for approval of the planned development a plan for the improvement and maintenance of open space acres and shall follow the plan, which is approved in developing the property.
f.
Open space maintenance. Where this article requires or allows the preservation of open space and other common areas through a homeowners' association, and if the property owners' association fails to maintain the common property in a reasonable condition, the director of planning and development shall serve written notice upon the association and upon the individual property owner of the planned development, setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain common open space in a reasonable condition. The notice shall include a demand that these deficiencies of maintenance are corrected within 30 days of the notice. If the deficiencies are not corrected within 30 days, the city, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the planned development and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and maintain it for one year and thereafter until the association is prepared to provide maintenance. The cost of this maintenance by the city shall be assessed against the properties within the planned development that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space, and shall become a lien upon the properties.

Commercial.
a.
Generally. The purpose of the commercial PUD district is intended for business uses that require a location accessible to major highways and arterials that serve or will serve significant portions of the community. It is also the intent of this district to provide areas for businesses that include a greater mix of business types than allowed in areas zoned C-1 and C-2. Commercial PUD allows for better land use, economy in development and flexibility of design. These businesses may require outside storage areas and have extended hours of operations. Due to the nature of the businesses permitted within the commercial PUD district, the zoning district should be limited to property fronting on principal arterials, major arterials or minor arterials.
b.
Development standards. The development for commercial PUD is as follows:

3.
Minimum buffer: The minimum buffer required for this use shall be in accordance with standards established for the zoning district in which it is located. In addition, when the back of the development is across the street from property in a residential district, then a solid fence or hedge not less than six feet in height shall be installed and maintained by the developer to screen the back of the development from the residential property.
4.
Distance between buildings: Buildings within the development, if separated, shall not be less than 20 feet apart, unless there is an adequate firewall.
5.
Parking: Parking shall have five and one-half spaces for each 1,000 square feet of floor area designated for retail sales only for centers up to 15 acres in size and eight spaces per 1,000 square feet of floor area designated for retail only for center of 15 or more acres. In addition, all parking areas must be designed following ADA regulations.

Sec. 75-453. - Undefined uses.
It is impossible to set forth each and every use of land that may exist now or in the future in the city. If approval is sought for a use not specifically identified, the building inspector shall consider the requested use to determine whether it is substantially similar to identified uses. For purposes of this section, the term "substantially similar" shall mean that the unidentified use shares the same characteristics as an identified use in terms of nature of operation, size of operation, impact from operation and requirements of the use. The director of planning and development's decision in this regard shall be subject to the appeal provisions of section 75-42. However, all decisions of the director which are not appealed, or any final decision on appeal shall be reduced to writing and kept in the official records of the city so as to ensure consistency of decision making about heretofore unidentified uses.
(Ord. of 3-20-2006; Amd. of 10-20-2008)
Sec. 75-454. - Uses limited by septic tank capabilities and water availability.
The development standards set forth in each of the divisions delineated in article III of this chapter apply to development in zoning districts in which public or community water lines are available and in which septic tank sewer service is possible. If community or public water or septic tank service is not available, then the standards applicable to that zoning district will vary at least as to minimum lot size inasmuch as developments which utilize septic tanks may require a larger developable lot size and also requires health department approval as to its appropriateness for septic tank or well water use. The building inspector is authorized to increase minimum lot sizes and otherwise vary district development standards as per division 1, article II of this chapter to accommodate the need to use septic tanks or well water and health department regulations in this regard. The unavailability of public sewer lines or water shall preclude the ability to develop projects which cannot utilize septic tanks. Any lot upon which an individual well or septic tank are to be provided shall have a minimum area of not less than that required by state and city/county health department regulations. The site location on the lot of these facilities shall be approved by the city/county health department in accordance with applicable requirements. In the event of a conflict between the lot sizes required by this chapter, or one required by state or city/county health department regulations, the more strict requirement shall govern.

(4)
Except as provided above, the natural topography of the land shall be preserved and natural growth shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin this natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion upon approval of the director of planning and development; this easement may cover no more than 20 percent of the required buffer area, and shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvements.
(5)
Where the conditions described in the preceding subsection cannot be met by reason of the topography of the land or of the prior removal of or lack of timber and foliage, the owner of the buffer area may erect a permanent wall or fence of not less than six feet in height or a screen of evergreen planting, so designed and developed as described in this subsection. These plantings shall consist of evergreen shrubs not less than six feet in height. The following plants shall be approved for this purpose but shall not be exclusive of other plants which may be suitable, provided that they can form a hardy screen, dense enough and high enough both to interrupt vision and to diffuse the transmission of sound:
Magnolia Grandiflora (Southern Magnolia).
Pinus Strobus (White Pine)
Prunus Caroliniana (Cherry Laurel).
Ligustrum Lucidyn (Glossy Ligustrum).
Ilex Burfordi (Buford Holly).
Elaeagnus Pungens (Elaeagnus).
(6)
Any grading, improvements or construction adjacent thereto shall be conducted far enough from the buffer area so as not to disturb or encroach upon the buffer area except for those uses as stated in number three of this section.

(g)
Open space. Open space areas required to be established by this chapter shall be permanently maintained as open space and appropriately landscaped with trees, shrubs, flowers, grass, stones, rocks or other landscaping materials. These areas may not be used for vehicular access, parking or similar uses except as otherwise permitted in this article.
(h)
Determination of development standards from private streets. When this chapter requires the establishment of minimum building setback lines, frontages and related development standards, these measurements for property not abutting a public street shall be made from or along a private street, except in apartment developments, where these measurements shall be made from public road frontages or as otherwise provided in this chapter.
(i)
Site plan preparation. Site plans and other development plans required to be submitted under the provisions of this chapter shall be prepared only by those currently registered for this work in accordance with applicable state law.
