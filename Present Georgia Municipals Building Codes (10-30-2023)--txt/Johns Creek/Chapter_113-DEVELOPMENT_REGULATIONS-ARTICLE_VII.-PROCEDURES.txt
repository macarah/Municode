Cores shall typically be located every 300 feet on alternating sides of the street and at the center of cul-de-sacs where no landscape island is present. When landscape islands are present in the cul-de-sac a core will be taken at a location identified by the land development inspector. Core reports shall be submitted to the land development inspector at the end of paving to determine compliance.
