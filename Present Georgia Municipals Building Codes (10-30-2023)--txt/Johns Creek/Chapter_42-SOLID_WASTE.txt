Sec. 42-45. - Indemnification and hold harmless.
Each company shall agree to indemnify, defend and save harmless the city, its agents, officers and employees, against and from any and all claims by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or other entity arising from any negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of the company, or any of its agents, contractors, servants, employees or sub-contractors, and from and against all costs, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities incurred in or about any such claim or proceeding brought thereon. Promptly after receipt from any third party by city of a written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that, immediately or with the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an "asserted claim") that may result in losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the city shall give written notice thereof (the "claims notice") to the company provided, however, that a failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the city's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the company is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The claims notice shall describe the asserted claim in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the losses that have been or may be suffered by the city when such information is available. The company may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any asserted claim. If the company elects to compromise or defend such asserted claim, it shall, within 20 business days following its receipt of the claims notice (or sooner, if the nature of the asserted claim so required) notify the city of its intent to do so, and the city shall cooperate, at the expense of the company, in the compromise of, or defense against, such asserted claim. If the company elects not to compromise or defend the asserted claim, fails to notify the city of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to provide indemnification under this agreement, the city may pay, compromise or defend such asserted claim with all reasonable costs and expenses borne by the company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the company nor the city may settle or compromise any claim without the consent of the other party; provided, however, that such consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any event, the city and the company may participate at their own expense, in the defense of such asserted claim. If the company chooses to defend any asserted claim, the city shall make available to the company any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.
