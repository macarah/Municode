The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
A-weighted sound level means the sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighting network as specified in ANSI documents for sound level meters that models human hearing frequency sensitivity by de-emphasizing the low frequency components of sound. The level so read is post scripted dB(A) or dBA.
Amplified sound means the reproduction of sound from any radio, stereo, CD player, DVD player, microphone, drum, turn table, audio or visual equipment, musical instrument, sound equipment, sound amplification device, television set,, exterior loudspeakers, bullhorn or similar device.

(2)
At the sole discretion of a law enforcement officer or code enforcement officer and as an alternative to making a determination of whether a sound is plainly audible, the following shall apply: A sound pressure level (SPL) reading may be taken at the receiving residential property according to the sound measurement procedures contained herein. In no instance shall the SPL from any entertainment venue music or amplified sound source exceed the following absolute limits except as prescribed herein:
TABLE 1.
EXPAND
Receiving Property Category Daytime:
7:01 AM—11 PM Nighttime:
11:01 PM—7 AM
dBA dBC dBA dBC

In cases where the receiving residential property background sound levels dBA or dBC exceed the levels in table 1, in no instance shall the sound pressure level from any entertainment venue amplified sound source exceed the receiving residential property background sound level, except as prescribed herein.
(4)
Insofar as practicable, sound shall be measured while the amplified sound of interest under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum, and fluctuating rates. When measurements cannot be conducted at or within the residential property boundary, they shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable.

All measurements shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:
a.
Only during periods when the sound pressure level from sound sources unrelated to the sound of interest dominate the measurement location;
b.
For a period of time sufficient to ensure that the measured sound pressure levels are typical of the sound of interest, but in no event shall the duration of measurement be less than one minute;
c.
Only during periods when wind speeds (including gusts) are no greater than 15 mph;
d.
Never under any condition that allows the SLM to become wet; and
e.

If the repair, alteration or improvement of said dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes;
(2)
If the repair, alteration or improvement of said dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property;
(3)
For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented; or

(e)
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved, to be vacated and closed, or to be demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(g)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(h)
The lien provided for in subsection (g) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county and shall relate back to the date of this filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket.

The county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city.
(i)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(j)
The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(k)
Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
(l)
The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety and other codes adopted by ordinance and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article.
(m)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
