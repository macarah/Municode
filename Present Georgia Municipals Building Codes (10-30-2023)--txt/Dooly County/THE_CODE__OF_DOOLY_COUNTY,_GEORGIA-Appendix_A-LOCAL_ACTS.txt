Sec. 2. - Composition of the Board.
(a)
The Board of Commissioners of Dooly County shall be composed of five members. For purposes of electing members of the Board of Commissioners, Dooly County is divided into five commissioner districts. One member of the Board shall be elected from each such district. The five commissioner districts shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan Name: doolywkl Plan Type: Local User: Gina Administrator; Dooly.
(b)
When used in such attachment, the terms 'Tract' and 'BG' (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a 'BG' heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a Block Group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Dooly County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Dooly County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.
(c)
Each candidate for election as Commissioner must be a resident of the district he or she seeks to represent at the time he or she qualifies as a candidate. The election of each Commissioner shall be by the voters of the district represented only.
