ARTICLE IV. - AGRICULTURE ZONE AG

Sec. 1. - Statement of Purpose.
The Agriculture zone is established in recognition of the high incidence of prime farmland throughout the County, high rate of farmer participation in the farmland preferential tax assessment program, the general population decline which has occurred in the unincorporated area during the preceding 30-year period (1960-1990), projections which suggest little, if any, population increase by the year 2010, and the relative absence of municipal utility services (water and sanitary sewer) in the unincorporated area. There is no indication of appreciable change in land use, and the need is not so much to prevent development that might conflict with future urban patterns as it is to protect the prevailing land use from conversion to land uses which would conflict with and are detrimental to agriculture. The intent is to protect the right to farm while allowing non-agricultural land uses which are compatible with agriculture, and which tend to support and serve the needs of residents and land use in the agriculture zone. Any acreage proposed to be subdivided for residential or other use in this zone must be rezoned to the appropriate zoning classification. Unless specifically zoned otherwise, all area beyond the incorporated limits of the towns and cities in Dooly County is part of the agriculture zone.

Sec. 4. - Conflicts.
By their very nature, some agricultural activities generate noises, odors and insect pests which are detrimental to nearby occupants. To the extent they are a function of the size of the specific agricultural activity, the adverse or negative effects of some of these noises, odors and insects can be mitigated somewhat by distance. For the purpose of mitigating said adverse and negative impacts, minimum distances between agricultural activities and surrounding land uses are hereby (Sections 5 and 6) established on the basis of low and high agricultural density levels.
Sec. 5. - Low Density Farm Animal Operations.
1.
Farm animal operations of sizes smaller or equal to the following thresholds are classified as low density:
EXPAND
Farm Animal Threshold
dairy cows 100
ducks 100
horses 50
poultry 150
sheep 100
steers/heifers 100
swine 150
turkeys 150
  2.
All low density farm animal operations constructed or expanded adjacent to an existing, noncompatible land use (e.g. residential) activity shall construct all buildings and fencing used for animal confinement (e.g., poultry house, farrowing house) at least 150 feet from the center line of an adjoining public road, and 200 feet from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use. Confinement fencing is not to be confused with boundary fencing, the latter of which may be constructed along the right-of-way and property line. The area between confinement fencing and boundary fencing may be used for row crop, vegetable or orchard production, or pasture. In the event said area is used for pasture it shall not be stocked at a rate higher than recommended by generally accepted animal husbandry practices for open grazing of the specific animal species. Where said area is grazed, fencing, as necessary, shall be erected around any surface feature, e.g., bog, to prevent livestock from congregating along boundary fencing adjacent to the property line of a noncompatible land use. Livestock catch pens shall be allowed in this grazing area, provided the specific site does not retain water.
3.
The site(s) used to dispose or treat any waste or by-product of a low density farm animal operation shall be located at least 150 feet from the center line of an adjoining public road, and at least 200 feet from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use.
4.
Machinery and equipment used to ventilate animal confinement buildings must be installed in such a way that air removed from said buildings is directed away from nearby development(s).
5.
Any development proposed for a site adjacent to and not compatible with an existing low density farm animal operation shall be constructed at least 150 feet from the centerline of the adjoining public road when said development fronts the low density operation, and 200 feet from the adjoining property line, when said development is adjacent to the low density operation.
Sec. 6. - High Density Farm Animal Operations.
1.
Farm animal operations of sizes greater than the thresholds identified in Section 5 (Low Density Farm Animal Operations) are classified as high density farm animal operations.
2.
High density farm animal operations initiated, constructed or expanded adjacent to an existing, noncompatible land use (e.g., residential) shall construct farm buildings and fencing used for animal confinement (e.g., poultry house, farrowing house, feedlot) at least 1,500 feet from the center line of an adjoining public road, and 1,500 feet from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use. Confinement fencing is not to be confused with boundary fencing, the latter of which may be constructed along the right-of-way and property line. The area between confinement fencing and boundary fencing may be used for row crop, vegetable or orchard production, or pasture. In the event said area is used for pasture it shall not be stocked at a rate higher than recommended by generally accepted animal husbandry practices for open grazing of the specific animal species. Where said area is grazed, fencing, as necessary, shall be erected around any surface feature, e.g., bog, to prevent livestock from congregating along boundary fencing adjacent to the property line of a noncompatible land use. Livestock catch pens shall be allowed in this grazing area provided the specific site does not retain water.
3.
Any site(s) used for temporary storage, disposal or active or passive treatment of any waste or by-product of a high density farm animal operation shall be located at least 1,500 feet from the center line of an adjoining public road, and at least 1,500 feet from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use.
4.
Machinery and equipment used to ventilate animal confinement buildings must be installed in such a way that air removed from said buildings is directed away from nearby development(s).
5.
Any development proposed for a site adjacent to and noncompatible with an existing high density farm animal operation shall be constructed at least 1,500 feet from the centerline of the adjoining road, when said development fronts the high density operation, and 1,500 feet from the adjoining property line when said development is adjacent to the high density operation.
Sec. 7. - Rural Business Uses Permitted, Prohibited and Development Standards.
A rural business shall be secondary or incidental to the primary use of property for agricultural or residential purposes. Such business shall be primarily directed toward providing local or neighborhood services to rural-residential areas. Rural businesses are intended to be of smaller size, intensity and scale than commercial uses that would be more commonly found in commercial zoning districts. Rural businesses shall be similar to home occupations except that the activity can occur in an accessory structure detached from the residence. In addition, an applicant for a rural business permit must be residing on the subject property prior to any application being filed for consideration by the Planning Commission, and must maintain residency thereon.

5.
Any use which is clearly out of scale or character with an agricultural and sparsely developed residential area.
Sec. 7-C. - Development Standards.
1.
The following standards shall apply to all rural businesses:
A.
A permitted, rural business shall be valid only as long as the original petitioner owns and operates the business and maintains a valid business license: the rural business use permit is not transferable. The rural business use permit shall become void upon expiration of the business license. Any subsequent owner of property previously permitted for a rural business use must apply to the Planning Commission for a rural business use permit.
B.
The property containing the site of the rural business must also be the bona fide residence of the petitioner/business owner.
