ARTICLE VII. - R-3 MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 7.01. - Statement of purpose.
A.
The R-3 district is designed to permit residential use of land with various types of multiple dwellings and related uses. This district should be located near major arterial and collector roads for good accessibility, and near utility infrastructure to reduce costs of development. Developments in this district are intended to complement single-family developments. Various types and sizes of residential accommodations, for ownership or rental, would thereby be provided to meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the community without overtaxing existing community facilities, utilities or services.
B.
It is also the intention of this article to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one building on a given site. The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large scale development have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of planned unit developments as special and particular land uses can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties. This type of development will permit a creative approach to residential development. A planned unit development will provide for an efficient use of land potentially resulting in more economical networks of streets and utilities thereby lowering housing and other land development costs as well as enhancing the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of natural features and the provision of recreation areas and open space.
C.
In creating this district the county intends to increase the variety of dwelling types in the housing market, and allow for innovative uses of real property which may not be suitable for development for other kinds of residential uses.
Sec. 7.02. - Permitted uses.
The following uses are permitted in the R-3 district:
