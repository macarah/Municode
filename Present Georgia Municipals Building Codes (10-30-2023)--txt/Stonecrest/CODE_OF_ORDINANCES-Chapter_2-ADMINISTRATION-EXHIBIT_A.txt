Guidelines for Communicating with the Media
Advice for communicating with the media can be limitless. It is imperative that you consult with the communications director to divulge the topic to be discussed and develop a discussion strategy. Your director and even legal counsel may advise you to stay away from certain topics. Herein, are a few rules for dealing with the media when issues are non-controversial and limited to the interviewee's area of expertise:
•
Return all inquiries as soon as possible or notify the media outlet of your intent to respond and give an anticipated time for your response. Members of the media work on deadlines and will seek another source if your response is not timely. Other sources may provide information that is not factual, incomplete or biased.
•
Answer only the questions asked. Limit that amount of elaboration you offer. Remember editing equipment can take long responses and shorten them while simultaneously changing the meaning.
•
Do not feel compelled or forced to conduct an interview. If you need time to prepare before answering, feel free to offer your response to questions that are emailed. This often allows you to avoid on-camera interviews. This method is not often preferred by television reporters but it will suffice if your responses are timely and with the media deadline.
•
Do not speculate. It is okay not to know the answer to a question and promise to follow up. Avoid "no comment" responses as they have a negative connotation.
•
Remember you are representing Stonecrest, therefore, personal opinions should be avoided or labeled as such when necessary to use.
•
Remember there is no such thing as, "off the record." Anything you say to or in hearing distance of a reporter may be printed, aired or televised.
•
Remember to keep your responses simple. You are the subject matter expert. Your audience is not. Avoid acronyms, jargon or shop talk.
•
Obtain the reporter's name and the name of the media organization. Find out when and how often your information will be aired or published.
•
Provide the best contact information for follow-up questions.
