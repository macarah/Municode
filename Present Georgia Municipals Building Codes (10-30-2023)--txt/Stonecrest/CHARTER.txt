(a)
The city manager shall be the chief administrative officer of the government of the city. The city manager shall devote all of his or her working full-time and attention to the affairs of the city and shall be responsible to the mayor and city council for the proper and efficient administration of the affairs of the city over which such officer has jurisdiction.
(b)
Based upon the firm belief that the proper, efficient, and effective administration and operation of the city's council-manager form of government will be fostered by a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the city council, mayor pro tempore, mayor, and city manager, this section states the following principles, which are intended to be fully consistent with this article:
(1)
The full and complete legislative and policymaking authority of the city resides in the part-time city council, mayor pro tempore, and mayor; and the full-time city manager shall take no action which impinges upon or interferes with the city council's or the mayor's policymaking role. Other than providing information relevant and germane to the city council's legislative deliberations, the city manager shall strive to remain a neutral party in such legislative deliberations. To ensure the actuality and appearance of neutrality, neither the city manager nor any department heads shall participate in any political activity on behalf of the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices, nor shall the city manager or any department head make any political contribution to the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices. The mayor, mayor pro tempore, and councilmembers shall not solicit or accept any campaign contributions from any city employee;

(5)
The mayor, mayor pro tempore, and city council shall not give directives to any city officers or employees, other than the city manager or officers appointed by the city council, regarding any matters including, but not limited to, constituent complaints and complaints regarding the services, operation, or administration of any department or function of city government. Although the mayor, mayor pro tempore, and city council shall not be prohibited from communicating with city officers or employees with constituent complaints or concerns, the city manager must be copied on all such communications;
(6)
The mayor, mayor pro tempore, and councilmembers, unless acting pursuant to a duly authorized investigation or inquiry, shall not discuss in open session the performance of or complaints against any city officer or employee during a city council meeting. This provision is not intended to prevent the mayor, mayor pro tempore, or city council from discussing, in general terms, the performance of or any issue relating to any department or function of city government;
(7)
It shall be prohibited for the mayor, mayor pro tempore, or any councilmember to sit in on personnel and management meetings between the city manager and city employees unless such participation is consented to by the city manager and approved by the city council;
(8)
The mayor shall have no management authority or responsibility with respect to the operations and administration of city government; and
(9)
The mayor, mayor pro tempore, and councilmembers, as elected officials, shall possess fundamental oversight duties and responsibilities with respect to all operations and administration of city government, and the city manager shall be responsible and duty bound to facilitate the mayor and city council's oversight function. Once the city council has passed the operating and capital budgets of the city, it shall be the responsibility of the city manager to administer such budgets and to keep the mayor, mayor pro tempore, and city council fully informed as to the city's progress against such budgets. The city manager shall provide monthly financial updates on the budgets with year to date information, and such updates shall contain all material information necessary for the mayor and city council to evaluate the financial performance and condition of the city. However, once the city council has appropriated funds in the budget and encumbered such funds through subsequent legislative action, the city manager shall have the authority to administer such budget, including contract administration and account payables, as part of the management function.

Upon the governing authority of the City of Stonecrest commencing to exercise its planning and zoning powers, the Municipal Court of the City of Stonecrest shall immediately have jurisdiction to enforce the planning and zoning ordinances of the city. The provisions of this subsection shall control over any conflicting provisions of any other subsection of this section.
(g)
Effective upon the termination of the transition period, subsections (b) through (f) of this section shall cease to apply except for the last sentence of subsection (e) which shall remain effective. Effective upon the termination of the transition period, the City of Stonecrest shall be a full functioning municipal corporation and subject to all general laws of this state.
Section 6.04. - Directory nature of dates.
It is the intention of the General Assembly that this Act be construed as directory rather than mandatory with respect to any date prescribed in this Act. If it is necessary to delay any action called for in this Act for providential cause or any other reason, it is the intention of the General Assembly that the action be delayed rather than abandoned. Any delay in performing any action under this Act, whether for cause or otherwise, shall not operate to frustrate the overall intent of this Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is specifically provided that if it is not possible to hold the referendum election provided for in Section 6.02 of this Act on the date specified in that section, then such referendum shall be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable but not later than 45 days after there is no further cause for delay. If the referendum election provided for in Section 6.02 of this Act is conducted after May 24, 2016, but before November 8, 2016, the special election for the initial members of the governing authority shall be conducted on the date specified in Section 2.02 of this Act. If the referendum election provided for under Section 6.02 of this Act is conducted after November 3, 2016, then the special election for the initial members of the governing authority shall be held as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, and the commencement of the initial terms of office shall be delayed accordingly. If the first election provided for in Section 2.02 of this Act occurs after the date of the 2016 November general election, the city council shall be authorized to delay the dates otherwise specified in Section 6.03 of this Act.
Section 6.05. - Charter commission.
No later than five years after the inception of the City of Stonecrest, the mayor and the city council shall call for a Charter commission to review the city's experience and recommend to the General Assembly any changes to the Charter. Members of the charter commission shall be appointed as follows: one by the mayor, one by each member of the city council, and one member appointed by a vote of the members of the Georgia House of Representatives and one member voted by the members of the Georgia Senate whose districts lie wholly or partially within the corporate boundaries of the City of Stonecrest. All members of the charter commission shall reside in the City of Stonecrest except those representing the Georgia House of Representative and the Georgia Senate. Neither the city council not the mayor shall appoint themselves to serve as members of the commission. The city attorney may serve as ex officio member of the commission with approval by the city council. The commission shall complete the recommendations within the time frame required by the city council.
(S.B. 21, Â§ 23, 4-1-2021)
Section 6.06. - Severability.
In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Act shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this Act, which shall remain of full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.
Section 6.07. - Effective date.
This Act shall become effective upon its approval by the Governor or upon its becoming law without such approval.
Section 6.08. - Repealer.
All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.

Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within the post that is contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia.
