DIVISION 722. - AMENDMENTS

Sec. 722.01. - Generally.
A.
This article [division], including the Official Zoning Map, may be amended by the Board of Commissioners on its own motion, or on recommendation of the Planning Commission, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or been submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation; provided, however, that after any such amendment has been submitted to and reviewed by the Planning Commission and its recommendation made thereon, the Board of Commissioners shall have the right to modify such amendment or place conditions thereon, and it shall not be necessary to resubmit such amendment, as modified or conditioned, to the Planning Commission. Before enacting an amendment to this article [division], the Board of Commissioners shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon.
B.
Application to amend this article [division] may be in the form of proposals to amend the text or Official Zoning Map. Unless initiated by the Board of Commissioners or Planning Commission, all applications for map amendments must be submitted by the owner (as determined by controlling at least a 51% interest in the property) or the authorized agent of such property. An application for an amendment affecting the same property shall not be submitted more than once every 6 months; however, this provision shall not apply to those properties affected by an amendment filed by the Board of Commissioners or Planning Commission.
Sec. 722.02. - Application for Map Amendments.
A.
Each application to amend the Official Zoning Map shall be filed with the Department of Planning and Zoning at least 31 days (or less at staff discretion) prior to the Planning Commission hearing at which they may be heard. Each application shall include such information as the Planning and Zoning Director may require including, but not limited to:
1.
A legal description of the tract(s) proposed to be rezoned;
2.
A plat showing the dimensions, acreage and location of the tract(s) prepared by an architect, engineer, landscape architect or land surveyor whose state registration is current and valid (his seal shall be affixed to the plat);
3.
The present and proposed zoning classification for the tract(s);
4.
The name(s) and address(es) of the owners of the land and their agents, if any;
5.
A copy of the recorded warranty deed (or other instrument of title) which vested title to the property in the applicant;
6.
A copy of the paid in full tax bill or a letter from the County Tax Department stating that all taxes have been paid; and
7.
A site plan showing any and all proposed improvements to be constructed if the application is approved.
B.
This application shall be accompanied by a fee to partially defray the public expense of processing the application. A fee shall not be charged if an official governmental agency files the application.
C.
No submitted application may be amended after public notice of the request has been given provided, however, the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners may allow such application to be amended during the public hearing.
D.
The applicant or agent shall be present at the hearings before the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners with regard to said application. In the event that an agent is present, rather than the applicant, such agent must have full authority to act on behalf of the applicant with regard to all matters pertaining to said application.
E.
The applicant shall be allowed to submit renderings, site plans and other exhibits purporting to depict what is to be constructed should a map amendment be approved; however, the applicant may be required to develop according to such plans if approved by the Board of Commissioners. Any deviation from such approved plans would require another rezoning application be filed. The Board of Commissioners may also require or attach to any rezoning such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so as to improve the quality of life through the protection against air, water and noise pollution and promotion of aesthetic considerations.
F.
An application may not be withdrawn by the applicant within 48 hours prior to a hearing on the matter, however, the Board of Commissioners may, by a majority of the members present, allow an application to be withdrawn without prejudice with respect to the 6-month limitation, or allow an application to be amended. Failure of the applicant or their representative to appear at the scheduled hearing may result in automatic dismissal with prejudice, rejection of the application or continuance of the hearing at the sole discretion of the Planning Commission or Board of Commissioners.
Sec. 722.03. - Assistance by Staff.
The Planning and Zoning Director upon receiving an application for amendment to the Official Zoning Map shall prepare and transmit a report to the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners determining:
a)
Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property;
b)
Whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use of usability of adjacent or nearby property;
c)
Whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned;
d)

e)
Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policies and intent of the land use plan; and
f)
Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approved or disapproved zoning proposal.

A.
The Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing on each rezoning application in accordance with their adopted schedule and procedures. The staff report on each application shall be considered and testimony solicited from the applicant and those interested citizens.

B.
As to each application, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation for approval, approval with modifications, denial, or approval to another zoning district or tabling of the request. The Planning Commission may only table a request upon consent of the applicant.

A copy of the Planning Commission's recommendations shall be prepared and submitted to the Board of Commissioners.
C.
The Planning Commission shall adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of hearings and meetings as are consistent with state law and the County code and are appropriate to its responsibilities which shall be published and available to the public, as well as conflict of interest rules, to insure that no member is entitled to rule on a matter in which he has an direct or indirect interest.
