The regulations of the MRO are designed to allow greater density and more flexible bulk and dimensional standards for the redevelopment of existing multifamily housing projects than is permitted for new multifamily development as an incentive for owners and developers to redevelop existing multifamily housing.
B.
"Redevelopment" defined. For purposes of this Section, the term "redevelopment" shall mean the reuse of existing developed property, which includes the demolition and replacement of all or portions of any existing building on the site constituting seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the tax assessed value of the property, and which may incorporate the new construction of additional buildings on the same site. Such reuse, if necessary, may include changes to the access, parking, landscaping and any other features of the site in order to accommodate the reuse of the property. No property or project shall qualify for the supplemental standards set forth in Section 2.02.04(E) below unless it meets this definition of redevelopment.
C.
Map Designation. The MRO District shall be in the form of an overlay zone and shall be established only in conjunction with one or more existing multifamily projects. When the MRO District designation is added to such property, the provisions of this Section shall apply in addition to the regulations established by this UDO for the underlying zoning district. Wherever there is conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Section and the underlying zoning district, the provisions of this Section shall control. Any parcel designated with this MRO District shall be designated on the City of Carrollton Zoning Map with the symbol "MRO" together with the underlying zoning designation (e.g., R-M/MRO).
