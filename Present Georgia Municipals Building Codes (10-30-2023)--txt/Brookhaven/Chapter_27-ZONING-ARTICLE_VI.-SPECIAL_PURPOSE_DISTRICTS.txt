ARTICLE VI. - SPECIAL PURPOSE DISTRICTS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 27-452. - Purpose.
Like overlay zoning districts, special purpose zoning districts are tools for dealing with unique neighborhoods or settings or accomplishing special planning and zoning goals. Unlike overlay districts, however, special districts are base zoning classifications; they do not "over-lay" other base zoning districts.
(Ord. No. RZ-2018-11-06 , § I, Exh. A(27.92), 11-27-2018)
Sec. 27-453. - Establishment.
Special purpose districts may be established, amended or removed only in accordance with the zoning map amendment procedures of article 10, division 2 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. RZ-2018-11-06 , § I, Exh. A(27.93), 11-27-2018)

(5)
Accommodate and promote a variety of housing types for residents of varying ages, incomes and lifestyle needs;
(6)
Ensure that the design and arrangement of buildings, structures, streets and open spaces contribute to creation of an inviting, walkable, mid-rise, human-scale environment through regulations addressing such features as:
a.
Consistent building setbacks;
b.
Doorways, windows, building projections and building recesses;
c.
Landscaping, lighting and street furniture to provide amenities and define the public realm; and
d.
Building materials that promote a design and appearance compatible with the desired urban village character of the area.
Improve pedestrian safety and comfort;
Maintain and promote community character and appearance; and
Ensure new development provides height and design transitions to R- and RM-zoned areas.

Examples of the types of development that may benefit from the MPD zoning tool include the following:
(1)
Enhanced protection of natural resources. Developments that offer enhanced protection of natural resources and sensitive environmental features, including streams, water bodies, floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, woodlands and native plant communities.
(2)
Traditional urban development. Developments characterized by lot configurations, street patterns, streetscapes, and neighborhood amenities commonly found in urban neighborhoods created before the 1950s.

Mixed-use development. Developments that contain a complementary mix of residential and nonresidential uses.
(4)
Mixed housing development. Residential developments containing a mix of housing types geared toward different age groups, income levels and lifestyle preferences.
(b)
Specific objectives. Different types of MPDs will promote different planning goals. In general, however, MPDs are intended to promote the following objectives:
(1)
Flexibility and creativity in responding to changing social, economic, and market conditions and that results in greater public benefits than could be achieved using conventional zoning and development regulations;
(2)
Implementation and consistency with the city's adopted plans and policies;
(3)
Efficient and economical provision of public facilities and services;
(4)
Sustainable, long-term communities that provide economic opportunity and environmental and social equity for residents;
(5)
Variety in housing types and sizes to accommodate households of all ages, sizes, incomes, and lifestyle choices;
(6)
Compact, mixed-use development patterns where residential, commercial, civic, and open spaces are located in close proximity to one another;
(7)
A coordinated transportation system that includes an inter-connected hierarchy of appropriately designed improvements for motorized and nonmotorized transportation;
(8)
Compatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement, massing, form, character, and landscaping to establish a high-quality livable environment;
(9)
The incorporation of open space amenities and natural resource features into the development design;
(10)
Low-impact development (LID) practices; and
(11)
Attractive, high-quality landscaping, lighting, architecture, and signage that reflects the unique character of the development.
