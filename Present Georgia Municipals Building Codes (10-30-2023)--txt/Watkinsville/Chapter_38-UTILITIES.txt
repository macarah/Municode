Sec. 38-2. - Wastewater capacity allocation regulations.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The purpose of wastewater capacity regulations is to ensure that applicants for new construction or redevelopment in the city meet specific criteria if they wish to utilize the limited available wastewater treatment capacity provided by the county through an intergovernmental agreement.
(2)
The city council seeks to utilize the city's allocation of capacity to strengthen downtown by allowing more mixed-use development with a residential component, to make the community more walkable and limit traffic impacts, by carefully increasing density in areas within walking distance (one-fourth mile) of areas zoned downtown (DT) or historic main (HM).
(b)
Authority. The city council is responsible for legislation, policy formulation, and overall direction setting. This includes policies which establish and direct the economic and land use development of the city. The city manager is responsible for carrying these out and managing the day-to-day operations and shall administer this subsection per all requirements of the city.
(c)
Wastewater capacity allocation criteria.
(1)
Wastewater capacity and waiting list. Any proposed new wastewater customer shall make application for service per this subsection. This also applies to any existing customer who desires to increase wastewater more than ten percent or substantially increase or alter the pollutant characteristics of its wastewater. Such persons shall specify the amount of wastewater service capacity requested upon application in addition to such other information requested by the city manager to further evaluate the criteria in subsection (c)(1)b of this section.
a.
Residential development. Applicants may be allocated wastewater capacity or be allowed to secure a position on the wastewater waiting list for any new residential development or redevelopment within the overlay district map if all of the following criteria are met, unless variances are granted by the city as set forth herein:

c.
Variances. City council, after a hearing, may vary the foregoing when enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice contrary to the spirit and purpose hereof, and also finds all of the following:
1.
Special conditions and circumstances peculiar and unique to this property exist and do not result from action or inaction of applicant.
2.
A variance will not give applicant a special privilege denied to others.
3.
The variance is the minimum to allow reasonable use of land.
4.
The variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the codes and not detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare.
d.
County regulations. Applicants are subject to county sewer regulations.
e.
Provision for residential septic system failure. The city will continue to allow residential wastewater service to homes with immediate adjacency to wastewater lines when septic tanks are documented and certified as failing by the county health department and a new one cannot be installed due to lot size and/or soil conditions. The city manager is authorized to approve allocation requests demanding less than 500 gallons per day.
(2)
Wastewater capacity allocation determinations. When city council can reasonably project available or soon-to-be available wastewater treatment capacity from the county, city council may offer such to those qualified applicants in such amounts as determined appropriate, taking into account the following:
a.
The date applicant can commit to use, on a continual basis, the capacity.
b.
Extent to which applicant can accept portions of capacity in phases over time.
c.
The waste loading of the projected wastewater, that is, its projected characteristics, volume, and impact on wastewater treatment.
d.
Applicant's history of violations of ordinance, laws, rules and regulations.
(3)
Wastewater capacity allocation determination guidelines. The following are established to properly balance residential, commercial, and industrial development and to fairly and equitably allocate the city's limited wastewater capacity:
a.
The city will maintain a wastewater capacity allocation summary list which includes project name, developer, number of units/lots at build-out, wastewater capacity requested, and a record of the allocation and/or number of lots/units approved. As building permits are issued, wastewater allocations and available capacity will be adjusted accordingly.
b.
Owner/developer may not transfer wastewater capacity allocations from one development to another. Allocations shall be site specific.
c.
Priorities:
1.
Maintain vitality of downtown Watkinsville and Main Street;
2.
Infill single-family homes;
3.
New development on undeveloped or vacant land.
d.
To balance residential, commercial, and industrial development, the city will reserve 50 percent of its wastewater capacity allocation for industrial and commercial facilities, and 50 percent for residential development.
(d)
Overlay district establishing location of wastewater capacity allocation. Allocation is established per the map attached to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
(e)
Wastewater service outside overlay district.
(1)
When capacity is available, the city reserves the right to consider extending wastewater service outside the overlay district for the express purpose of allowing innovative, generally mixed-use, projects that offer an exceptional or unusual mix of amenities and connectivity, that honor the goals of the city's land use plan, zoning codes, and overall goals of better connecting its citizens.
(2)
The city expressly wishes to avoid densification of existing neighborhoods or to offer wastewater service to new neighborhoods close to the edges of the city limits or more than one-fourth mile from the downtown (DT) and historic main (HM) zoning districts, provided, however, if at least 50 percent of the development is within the one-fourth requirement, it may be eligible.
(3)
Specific project attributes that allow a project outside the overlay district to merit consideration for residential wastewater service shall include all of the following, unless a variance is granted by the city council as set forth herein:
a.
Pedestrian and generally non-vehicular orientation, requiring installation of significant sidewalks, paths, and alternative transportation amenities that allow the new development to connect to downtown Watkinsville.
b.
Projects must connect to downtown Watkinsville (either the HM or DT zone) via a direct greenway, side path, or a five-foot or wider sidewalk and generally be compatible with the approved transportation study.
c.
If existing non-vehicular infrastructure exists, it all must be brought up to current standards to ensure easy non-vehicular connection to downtown, and connect such development to the city's existing pedestrian network.
d.
Pedestrian and non-vehicular connectivity to any churches, schools with more than 100 students, community facilities (libraries, post offices, government offices, etc.) or parks within one-fourth mile of the project.
e.
Extensive greenspace preservation, including additional parks, recreational amenities, or other assets that improve the environment but may require smaller lot footprints to do so.
f.
Extensive installation of environmentally friendly amenities, such as LEED certified structures and buildings.
g.
Protection of trees with an emphasis on preservation of large hardwoods (e.g., oaks, hickories, yellow poplars of 12-inch diameter at breast height (dbh) or greater), large softwoods (e.g., pines, deodar cedars of 12-inch dbh or greater), and small specimen trees (e.g., dogwoods, redbuds, and sourwoods of six-inch dbh or greater), or establishment of a robust tree plan.
h.
Green infrastructure and low impact development (LID) practices EPA uses to reduce stormwater runoff and pollution, such as green roofs, rain barrels and cisterns, permeable pavements, bioretention areas, vegetated swales/dry swales, curb and gutter elimination, vegetated filter strips, and sand and organic filters.
i.
Extensive mixed-use amenities, including on-site retail, convenience, shopping, medical, recreational, or business amenities that will be utilized by residents of the new development, limiting vehicular trips.
j.
Preservation of paths, routes, right-of-way, intersections, and crossings outlined in any city future land use or transportation planning maps and, if plans are finalized, installation of any transportation facilities (vehicular, pedestrian, or other).
k.
The project design shall be of quality appearance and materials, meeting all current chapter requirements, and be aesthetically harmonious with existing city architecture and with classic architectural elements and fenestration of certain historic and historic reproduction buildings in the downtown area, and emphasize historical and/or upscale design details that help increase salability while also helping blend better with existing historic and newer quality homes and/or developments in the city.
(4)
Variances. City council, after a hearing, may vary the foregoing when enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice contrary to the spirit and purpose hereof, and also finds all of the following:
a.
Special conditions and circumstances peculiar and unique to this property exist and do not result from action or inaction of applicant.
b.
A variance will not give applicant a special privilege denied to others.
c.
The variance is the minimum to allow reasonable use of land.
d.
The variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the codes and not detrimental to public health, safety, and welfare.
(f)
Reservations.
(1)
Should any wastewater capacity allocation be granted to an applicant for a specific project, the recipient shall show significant progress on development of the project by providing a site plan within six months, and once a building permit is issued, must call for first inspection within six months.
(2)
Otherwise, city reserves the right to withdraw any allotment or portion thereof previously granted and require the applicant to reapply for a wastewater capacity allocation.
