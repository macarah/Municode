ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 20-1—20-18. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - MOBILE HOMES AND MOBILE HOME PARKS

Sec. 20-19. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Accessory use means a use customarily incidental to the principal use of the land.
Family means one or more persons occupying a dwelling and living as a single housekeeping unit, as distinguished from persons occupying a boardinghouse, lodginghouse, or hotel.
Lot means a parcel of land occupied or to be occupied by one or more main buildings and its accessory buildings with such open and parking spaces as are required by the provisions of this article and having its frontage upon a public street.
Mobile home means a movable or portable dwelling unit constructed to be towed on its own chassis, connected to utilities and designed without a permanent foundation for year-round occupancy, which can consist of one or more components that can be retracted for towing purposes and subsequently expanded for additional capacity, or two or more units separately towable but designed to be joined into one integral unit. Removal of wheels does not change the classification of the dwelling. Construction of a permanent foundation and other permanent improvements and attachments can change the classification of a mobile home to that of a modular building.
Mobile home park means any lot on which are customarily parked three or more mobile homes for a longer period of time than 30 days for rental purposes.
Modular building means a factory-fabricated, transportable building consisting of units designed to be incorporated at a building site on a permanent foundation into a permanent structure to be used for residential or commercial purposes. Placement of permanent foundation, porches, roof design and other like factors distinguish a modular building from a mobile home.
Open space means an area which is not used for or occupied by a driveway, off-street parking, loading space, yard or refuse storage space.
Plat means a map, plan or layout of a county, city, town, section, subdivision, or development indicating the location and boundaries of properties.
Principal use means the primary purpose for which land or a building is used.
Right-of-way line means the dividing line between a lot, tract or parcel of land and a contiguous right-of-way.
