ARTICLE VI. - SIGNS

Sec. 34-234. - Purpose.
(a)
Sign regulations achieve public safety rationales not achieved by standard building code provisions. Without sign regulations, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has long been recognized that sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. Signs can distract motorists by impairing visibility. Traffic safety is improved by restricting the size, height, and location of signs. Signs, if unregulated, can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs.
(b)
Unregulated signs may negatively affect the character of communities and the value of buildings. For example, blighted signs and antiquated signs and sign structures (i.e., the pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can contribute to an overall image of blight and a reduction of property values in declining areas if not addressed and removed via sign controls. Unregulated signs can reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public because they compete with public purpose signs and reduce their visibility and effectiveness. Unregulated signage in special character areas, such as the downtown, would almost assuredly neutralize any public plans and investments to improve streetscapes.
(c)
This article is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests by correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this statement of purpose.

Sec. 34-237. - Master signage plan required.

(b)
For any lot on which the owner proposes to erect one or more signs requiring a permit, unless such lot is included in a common signage plan, the owner shall submit to the city a master signage plan containing the following:
(1)
An accurate plat of the lot at such scale as the city may reasonably require.
(2)
Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas on such lot.

Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for individual signs, the height of signs, and the number of freestanding signs allowed on the lots included in the plan under this article.
(4)
An accurate indication on the plat of the proposed location of each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not, except that incidental signs and signs not regulated by this article need not be shown
(5)
The name of the owner of the property and, if different than the owner, the name of the applicant.

(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 9.27)
Sec. 34-261. - Computations.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height:
(1)
Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall.
(2)
Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
(3)
Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest point of the sign face. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade of the sign is lower than the grade of the adjacent public street, normal grade shall be construed to be the grade of the adjacent public street. The term "adjacent public street" shall mean the street providing approved vehicle access to the property and which does or would bear the street address for the property.
(4)
Computation of maximum total permitted sign area. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 9.28)
Sec. 34-262. - Design, construction, and maintenance.
All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards:
(1)
Except for banners, flags, and temporary signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this article, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or other structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure.
(2)
Every sign, including, but not limited to, those signs for which permits are required, shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and sound structural condition.
a.
To prevent rust, peeling, flaking, fading or rotting, all signs and supports shall be painted, unless anodized or similarly treated.
b.
Broken panels, missing letters, defective illumination, torn fabric, flaking or peeling paint and other damage to a sign shall be replaced or repaired.
(3)
If a determination is made by the city that any sign is unsafe, not secure, in violation of this section, or is in violation of any applicable law or a public danger, notice of such violation shall be given to the property owner and/or occupant where such sign is located. The property owner and/or occupant shall have 30 days from the date of said notice to remove, repair, or remedy said violation.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 9.29)
Sec. 34-263. - Signs in the public right-of-way.

Informational signs of a public utility regarding its poles, lines, pipes, or facilities.

Sec. 34-265. - Nonconforming signs and signs without permits.
O.C.G.A. § 32-6-83 states, "Any municipal corporation or city is authorized to acquire by purchase, gift, or condemnation and to pay just compensation for any property rights in outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which were lawfully erected but which do not conform with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or resolution or which at a later date fail to comply with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or resolution due to changed conditions beyond the control of the sign owner. No municipal corporation or city shall remove or cause to be removed any such nonconforming outdoor advertising sign, display, or device without paying just compensation." In accordance, signs existing in the planning jurisdiction which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this resolution shall be permitted to remain in place and be maintained, provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 9.32)
Sec. 34-266. - Criteria for approval of sign variances.
A variance may be granted upon application if an individual case of unusual hardship is placed upon the applicant. The request for a variance must meet the following conditions:
(1)
There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area.
(2)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties.
(3)
Granting the variance requested would not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges that are denied to other similar properties.
(4)
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
(5)
The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant.
(6)
The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is prohibited by this article.
(7)
The mere existence of a nonconforming sign or advertising device shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 9.33)
