(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 12.1)
Sec. 34-362. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to:
(1)
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
(2)
Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(3)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal;
(4)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way to minimize the adverse visual impact to the city;
(5)
Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the city quickly, effectively and efficiently.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 12.2)
Sec. 34-363. - Aesthetics.
The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas governed by this article.
(1)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping which will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
(3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or is closely comparable with, the supporting structure and/or surrounding area so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design which would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 12.3)
Sec. 34-364. - General.
(a)
Height limitations. The height limitations set forth in this article, as applicable to buildings and structures, shall not apply to towers and antennas. Towers and antennas shall be governed by the special exception permit procedures set forth herein.
(b)
Tower height threshold. These standards shall only be applicable to antenna and towers in excess of 35 feet in height.
(c)
Site specific plans. The city council may consider for approval a site plan specific request which is in substantial conformance with the requirements listed herein.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 12.4)
Sec. 34-365. - Special exception permit.
(a)
A special land use permit shall be required for all television, land mobile, communication, microwave, radio transmission antennas and towers.

(f)
All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission or such governing agency guidelines as may be established by named agencies. All towers and antennas must be updated and brought into conformity with such standards and regulations within six months of their adoption. The failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the city to require removal or re-permitting of the antenna or tower at the owner's expense.
(g)
At the time of application for building permit, the plans for tower or antenna construction shall be certified by an independent registered structural engineer as meeting all current safety and design standards of all applicable codes. Cost of engineering evaluation shall be the responsibility of the individual or corporation applying for the building permit.
(h)
Applicants are required to explore and fully utilize existing tower and antenna space and are required to bear an equitable share of capital, operating and other expenses in connection with such shared usage.
(i)
Nonresidential sites are encouraged for tower location where possible and use of platted lots in existing subdivisions are discouraged.
(j)
In addition, all such towers and antennas shall be designed to minimize visual and scenic impact when located on slopes greater than 15 percent or on top of such slopes.
(k)
Any tower approved under the provisions of this article which is not utilized by any communications service provider for any communications-related purpose for a period of 12 consecutive months shall lose any privilege of special exception previously granted by the city council and must therefore be re-submitted for approval prior to use for any purpose not permitted by the existing zoning.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 12.6)
Sec. 34-367. - Co-location of antennas.
(a)

(a)
Required setbacks. Unless otherwise noted within this section's requirements, or otherwise approved by the city council, any commercial tower or antenna which abuts a residentially zoned property shall have a minimum 40-foot setback from the residential property, 15 feet of which shall be a landscaped, screening buffer between the tower and the residentially zoned property, which shall be subject to city council approval. This setback is in addition to the required height setback in section 34-366(a). Required buffers may be included within required setbacks; however, in such case that required buffers and setbacks are in conflict, the more stringent shall apply. Additionally, necessary private utilities and/or access drives may be allowed through, over, or across a landscaped buffer. Any such uses which are proposed through, over, or across a designated, undisturbed buffer must be approved pursuant to an original site plan approved by the city council.
(b)
Objectives. The above-required landscape screening buffer shall be implemented in connection with a permitted project and shall address the following objectives:
(1)
Screening to enhance aesthetic appeal;
(2)
Controlling or directing vehicular and pedestrian movement;
(3)
Reducing glare;
(4)
Buffering noise; and
(5)
Establishing privacy.
(c)
Standards. The required landscape buffer is subject to review and approval by the city council in accordance with the following standards:
(1)
Plantings are to be a mix of rows of evergreen trees and shrubs, deciduous trees and evergreens taller than the required five-foot minimum;
(2)
Species are to be ecologically compatible to site and appropriate for design situation;
(3)
Unless public safety concerns dictate otherwise, buffers should provide maximum visual barrier to adjoining properties and public streets;
(4)
Minimum height of plant materials at installation is to be five feet for trees;
(5)
Fencing or walls are to be a minimum of six feet in height as approved by the city council;
(6)
Buffers shall be regularly maintained by the property owners to ensure that the above objectives and standards are met;
(7)
When topography and existing conditions allow, the required landscape buffer should be undisturbed; provided, however, the buffer may be crossed by an access drive and/or necessary utilities as shown on the site plan;
(8)
Any appeals from a determination by the city regarding the landscape buffer shall be considered by the city council.
(d)
Maintenance. It will be the responsibility of the owner of the telecommunications tower to keep all landscaping material free from disease and properly maintained, including replacing any vegetation destroyed or dead. Maintenance includes keeping the buffer and landscape area free from liter and debris and to keep plantings neat in appearance.
(e)
Noise. No equipment shall be operated at a telecommunications structure that produces noise levels above 45 dB as measured from any adjacent property line or right-of-way, except for emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator. Generators for emergency power shall be used only so long as line power is out. Generators shall not be used to power towers prior to hookup by the local power company.
(f)
City usage. After the city has issued the permit, the city shall have the right, through contractual agreement with the owners, to have antenna space on the tower for three antennas to serve the needs of the citizens of the city. There shall be no time limit for use of the tower free of charge. The proposed E911 system for the county may utilize all three antennas for the transit and receive modes.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 12.8)
Sec. 34-369. - Action by city council.
(a)
Upon receipt of special exception permit application there will be a public hearing regarding the special exception and building permit.
(b)
Public notification. Legal notice of the public hearing before the city council shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation in the city in which the legal advertisements of the city are published. The application advertisement shall include date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the date of the first hearing by the city council.
(c)
The city council shall approve or deny any special exception permit request and require any conditions deemed necessary or appropriate to maintain safety, health, scenic value, and welfare of city. Any special exception permit for communications towers that are denied shall be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
(Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 12.9)
Sec. 34-370. - Standards for review.
(a)
The city council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to approve this proposed use:
(1)
Height of the proposed tower/fall zones;
(2)
Proximity of the tower to residential structures or uses which may be incompatible with the towers (such as private or public airports);
(3)
Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4)
Surrounding topography;
(5)
Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
(6)
Proposed ingress and egress; and
(7)
Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures.
(b)
Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
(1)
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(2)
Existing towers and structures do not have sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(3)
Existing towers and structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
(4)
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(5)
The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
(6)
The applicant demonstrates there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unreasonable.
