Street means a public right-of-way, whether designated as an avenue, boulevard, road, highway, expressway, lane or other way, that is dedicated or devoted to public pedestrian or vehicular use by deed, plat, and/or prescription, which affords the principal means of access to abutting property. This chapter excludes Interstate 20.
Arterial streets are intended to provide higher travel speeds between or within communities or to and from collectors and expressways. Access is controlled so that only community-significant land use may have direct access to these streets.
Collector streets connect residential streets to the highway system's major and higher (minor) arterials to provide access to nonresidential uses and arterials. Collectors form barriers between neighborhoods and are designed for higher speeds and traffic volumes than are residential streets. Because non-congested traffic flow is necessary for their effective functioning, residential uses are prohibited access to collectors. Collectors are classified as major collectors and minor collectors.
Major collector. The primary function is to carry traffic for most major intra-urban trips over one mile, particularly during peak hours. These streets provide only limited direct access to adjacent land. This direct access is usually focused on major facilities, shopping centers or other significant traffic generators. Major collectors are usually designed with four travel lanes and may be either divided or undivided. On-street parking cannot be permitted.
Minor collector. The primary function is to carry traffic for short to medium (one-half to one mile) intra-urban trips and serves primarily local traffic. These strips receive traffic from residential streets and transmit it to major collectors and arterials. Minor collectors spaced to relieve excessive traffic volumes on local streets are commonly designed with two travel lanes.
Structure means anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires a fixed location on or in the ground, or which is attached to something having a fixed location on the ground. Structures include, but are not limited to, the following: site built buildings, industrialized buildings, manufactured homes, mobile homes, billboards, swimming pools, advertising signs, satellite dishes and fall-out shelters.

Variance means a deviation from of the strict terms of the zoning regulations granted by the city where such modification will not be contrary to the public interest, and where, owing to conditions unique to the individual property on which the variance is sought and not as a result of any intentional action on the part of the property owner, a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary and undue hardship; provided, however, that no variance shall be granted which shall authorize a land use or lot size not otherwise permitted in a particular district.
