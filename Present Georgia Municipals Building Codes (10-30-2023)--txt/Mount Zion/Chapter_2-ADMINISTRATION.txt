ARTICLE VI. - EMPLOYEE SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY

Sec. 2-138. - Policy purpose and guidelines.
(a)
The city is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when a city employee illegally uses drugs on or off the job, or abuses alcohol on the job. Therefore, the city has established the following policy:
(1)
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job.
(2)
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or while possessing in his body, blood or urine illegal drugs in any detectable amount.
(3)
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or impaired by alcohol.
(4)
It is a violation of the city policy for any employee to use prescription drugs illegally, i.e., to use prescription drugs that have not been legally obtained or in a manner or for a purpose other than as prescribed. However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications.
(5)
Violations of this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
(b)
It is the responsibility of city supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a drug problem. Although it is not the supervisor's job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and co-workers should encourage anyone who has a drug problem to seek help.
(c)
The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive and drug-free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment at the city.
(d)
As a condition of employment, employees must abide by the terms of this policy and must notify the city in writing of any conviction of a violation of a criminal drug statute no later than five calendar days after such conviction.
(e)
The city offers resource information on various means of employee assistance in our community, including, but not limited to, drug and alcohol abuse programs. Employees are encouraged to use this resource file, which is located on the bulletin boards in each department. In addition, we will distribute this information to employees for their confidential use.
(f)
An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to properly perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status. Next, the supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse has occurred. If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, the employee will be sent home or to a medical facility by a safe transportation alternative depending on the determination of the observed impairment, accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. A drug test may be in order. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive.
(g)
Employees and job applicants who have a positive confirmed test result may explain or contest the result to the city within five working days after the city contacts the employee or job applicant and shows him the positive test result as it was received from the laboratory in writing.
(h)
The confidentiality of any information received by the employer through substance abuse testing shall be maintained, except as otherwise provided by law.
(i)
All job applicants at the city will undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment. Any applicant with a confirmed positive test will be denied employment.
(j)
Applicants will be required to submit voluntarily to a urinalysis test at a laboratory chosen by the city and, by signing a consent agreement, will release the city from liability.
(k)
The city has adopted testing practices to identify employees who use illegal drugs on or off the job or who abuse alcohol on the job. It shall be a condition of employment for all employees to submit to substance abuse testing under the following circumstances:
(1)
When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol. Reasonable suspicion is based on a belief that an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of the employer's policy drawn from specific objective and articulate facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in light of experience. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon, but not limited to, the following:
a.
Observable phenomena while at work, such as direct observation of substance abuse or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being impaired due to substance abuse;
b.
Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance;
c.
A report of substance abuse provided by a reliable and credible source;
d.
Evidence that an individual has tampered with any substance abuse test during his employment with the current employer;
e.
Information that an employee has caused or contributed to an accident while at work; or
f.
Evidence that an employee has used, possessed, sold, solicited or transferred drugs while working or while on the employer's premises or while operating the employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment.
(2)
When employees have caused or contributed to an on-the-job injury that resulted in a loss of work time, which means any period of time during which an employee stops performing the normal duties of employment and leaves the place of employment to seek care from a licensed medical provider. An employer may send employees for a substance abuse test if they are involved in an on-the-job accident where personal injury or damage to city property occurs.
(3)
As part of a follow-up program to treatment for drug abuse.
(4)
When a substance abuse test is conducted as part of a routinely scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination that is part of the employer's established policy or that is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification or group.
(l)
Employees with a confirmed positive test result may, at their option and expense, have a second confirmation test made on the same specimen. An employee will not be allowed to submit another specimen for testing.
(m)
If the physician, official or lab personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has tampered with specimen, the employee is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Sec. 2-167. - Ethics.
It is the policy of the city to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the city finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the city. The city will set up and conduct a procurement program that maximizes service benefits to the community and awards contracts to vendors who offer the best value.
(1)
The city declares that city employees and officials along with those wishing to do business with the city have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition.
(2)
Every officer and employee of the city whose duties involve the purchase or sale of goods and/or services, or the preparation of specifications for the purchase of goods and/or services for the city, or deciding which goods shall be declared surplus are expressly prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value, directly or indirectly, from any person, company, firm or corporation which seeks to do business with or contract with the city or has contracted with the city within the preceding 12 months, or to which any purchase order or contract is awarded, or to whom any surplus goods may be sold.
(3)
Prospective vendors must compete for city business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction.
(4)
The city's ethics ordinance and city Charter should be consulted for requirements related to lobbying and representation of business interests that come before the city council or city officials for decision.
(5)
Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the city seeks to establish relationships with business partners whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here.
(6)
A vendor's contract compliance history with the city and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation.
(7)
The city stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The mayor and council are authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the city's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the city's goals.
(8)
The city employees, officials, and their family members are generally prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of undue advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner.
(9)
It is unethical for any city employee or elected official to purchase commodities or services from a city contract for personal use.
(10)
Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a city contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any city officer, elected official, employee or other city representative other than the designated individual named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the city council. The mayor and council will review violations. If determined that such communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified from consideration for award.
(Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(060), 5-8-2018)
Sec. 2-168. - Disclaimer of responsibility for improper purchasing.
The city council may disclaim responsibility and liability for any purchase, expenditure, or agreement for expenditure arising from procurement made in its name, or in the name of any governmental body under its authority, by an unauthorized person or any person acting outside this article or the authorization or delegation as provided in this article. The expense of any such disclaimed transaction will become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly.
(Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(061), 5-8-2018)
Sec. 2-169. - Evasion prohibited.
No purchase or sale shall be artificially divided for the purpose of evading the provisions of this article. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts.
(Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(070), 5-8-2018)
Sec. 2-170. - Summary of methods of procurement.
In most cases, this article recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used.
(1)
Informal purchase. Those purchases $10,000.00 or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals.
(2)
Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases, the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met:
a.
Clear and adequate specifications are available.
b.
Three or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process.
c.
Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00.
d.
Revenue is greater than $10,000.00.
(3)
Competitive sealed proposal. When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
a.
Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services.
b.
Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest.
c.
Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous.
d.
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
e.
Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00.
f.
Revenue is greater than $10,000.00.
(4)
Sole source purchase. A sole source procurement may be used when only one vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurements or by approval of the mayor and council, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. The city council shall approve all purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00.
(5)
Emergency purchase. The city shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time. Acquisitions shall be made using such competitive procedures as circumstances reasonably permit. All emergencies where cost is greater than $10,000.00 require ratification of the city council.
(6)
Cooperative purchase. The city may participate in a cooperative purchase for commodities, supplies and services when determined that it is in the best interest of the city. The sponsoring entity, whether federal, state or local, must have performed a competitive procurement process and entered into a contract that stipulates allowance for other governmental entities to purchase from the supplier at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as extended to it. If such arrangement has not been made a part of the contract, written permission from the sponsoring entity and the awarded supplier must be obtained. Cooperative purchases where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council.
(7)
Governmental and affiliated entity purchase. The city may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and nonprofit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the city. Such purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council.
(Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(080), 5-8-2018)
Sec. 2-171. - Mandatory pre-qualification process.
(a)
Public works construction contracts governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 et seq. The city is hereby delegated the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f).
(b)
All other contracts. The city is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to the following requirements:
(1)
Criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work.
(2)
Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information.
(3)
There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification.
(4)
There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder to respond to his disqualification to the city; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal.
(5)
No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened.
(Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(081), 5-8-2018)
Sec. 2-172. - Purchases based on informal procurement.
(a)
General. Procurements that involve amounts $10,000.00 or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the city.
(b)
Prohibition of improper use of informal purchase process. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals.
(c)
Procedures. Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the city. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction.
(d)
Types of informal purchases. Informal purchases are classified by two categories:
(1)
Those that may be made directly by the using department.
(2)
Those that are required to be made through the central procurement process.
(e)
Informal purchase by user departments.
(1)
Authority. Each user department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the mayor and/or council, to handle purchases where the cost is less than $2,500.00.
(2)
Prohibition of misuse. Purchases may not be artificially divided in order to qualify for handling by the using departments; neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts.
(Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(090), 5-8-2018)
Sec. 2-173. - Competitive sealed bids.
(a)
Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00. Any commodity that is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $10,000.00 shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process, except as otherwise provided in this article.
(b)
Dissemination of invitation to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be given as required by state law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening.

Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent.
(c)
Receipt of bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the city by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid.

The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection.
(e)
Modification of bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described below, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the city determines the correction to be in the city's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening:
(1)
Price information.
(2)
Any required bonding.
(f)
Withdrawal of bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following:
(1)
The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure.
(2)
Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if request is made to withdraw the bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid.
(g)
Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation.
(h)
Bid cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file.
(i)

(3)

(5)
Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor if only one of the bidders has an office located within the boundaries of the city. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local vendors, the city shall request the firm's best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid.
(Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(100), 5-8-2018)
