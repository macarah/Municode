ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 44-1. - Purpose and intent of chapter.
It is with the intent of creating a climate conducive to the orderly and progressive growth of the city, a climate of mutual and reasonable understanding with prompt and just consideration to the various interests involved in subdivisional work, that the procedures and requirements set forth in this chapter have been established. Similarly, community interests require the regulation and control of development to ensure reasonable protection of property values and to promote a healthy environment for the citizens of the city. The regulations contained in this chapter have been formulated and adopted for the purpose of promoting the health, safety and morals and the general welfare of the people of the city.

Lot width means the width of the lot at the building line measured parallel to the street right-of-way line.
Master plan means a comprehensive plan, which may consist of several maps, data and other descriptive matter, for the physical development of the city, or any portion thereof, including any amendments, extensions or additions thereto recommended by the planning commission, indicating the general location for major roads, parks or other public open spaces, public building sites, routes for public utilities, zoning districts or other similar information.
Planning commission means the planning commission of the city.
Setback line orbuilding line means the minimum horizontal distance between the street right-of-way line, or the street centerline where appropriate, and the building or any projection thereof except:

(2)
Balconies, canopies or cornices projecting not more than three feet beyond the main building wall; or
(3)
Offset or overlapping portions of the second floor of the building that do not extend more than three feet beyond the main wall of the building.
Streets and alleys means ways for vehicular traffic, whether designated as a street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, throughway, road, avenue, boulevard, lane, place or however otherwise designated.
(1)
Alleys means minor ways which are used primarily for vehicular service access to the back or the side of properties otherwise abutting on a street.
(2)
Collector streets means those which carry traffic from minor or neighborhood streets to the major system of streets and highways, including the principal entrance streets of a residential development and streets for circulation within such a development.
(3)
Major streets and highways means those which are used primarily for fast or heavy traffic.
(4)
Marginal access streets means minor streets which are parallel to and adjacent to major streets and highways, and which provide access to abutting properties and protection from through traffic.
(5)
Minor streets means those which are used primarily for access to the abutting properties.
Subdivider means any person, corporation or duly authorized agent who undertakes the subdivision of land.
Subdivision.
(1)
The term "subdivision" means the division, development or redivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land regardless of how it is to be used into two or more lots either by plat or by metes and bounds description, or the division or redivision of land involving the dedication of a new park, playground, street or other public right-of-way or facility; or the vacation, realignment or any other change in existing streets, alleys, easements, recreational areas, water areas or other public improvements or facilities, and, when appropriate to the context, shall relate to the act or process of subdividing or to the land subdivided.
(2)
For the purposes of this chapter, the following are excepted from the term "subdivision":
a.
Any subdivision of land for agricultural purposes, provided no lot thereby produced has an area of less than ten acres and an average width of from 400 feet and where no new streets, roads or other rights-of-way are involved.
b.
The sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining properties, provided that additional lots are not thereby created and that the lots created are not reduced below the minimum sizes required by this chapter or the zoning regulations of the city.

Conditions. The planning commission shall have authority to vary and modify the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that in granting variances and modifications, the planning commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.
(b)
Hardship. Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with the regulations established in this chapter, it may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided, however, that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the master plan or this chapter.
(c)
Large-scale development. The standards and requirements of the regulations established in this chapter may be modified in the case of a plan and program for a complete community or a neighborhood unit, which, in the judgment of the planning commission, provides adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will ensure conformity to and achievement of the plan.

Consultation with building official. Prior to the preparation of the subdivision plat, the subdivider shall confer with the building official, who shall review the sketch plan of the proposed subdivision to determine whether the subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter. This step does not require formal application or filing of the plat with the planning commission.
(b)
Favorable consideration by building official. Upon receiving favorable consideration of the building official, the subdivider may then proceed to prepare the preliminary plat for submission to the planning commission.
(c)
Favorable consideration by building official not to constitute approval. Favorable consideration by the building official, under no circumstances, shall be construed as preliminary or tentative approval of the subdivision.
(Code 1984, § 8-5-21; Code 1996, § 78-51)
Sec. 44-61. - Conditional approval of preliminary plat.
(a)
Preparation. On reaching conclusions informally, as described in section 44-60, regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with other supplementary material as deemed necessary by the building official and specified in section 44-28.
(b)
Submission to planning commission. Four copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material specified, together with two copies of a written letter of application for conditional approval of the preliminary plat, shall be submitted to the planning commission at least seven days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered.

(e)
Conditional approval not to constitute final approval. Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, such conditional approval shall be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of the planning commission upon fulfillment of the requirements of this chapter and the conditions of the conditional approval, if any.
(Code 1984, § 8-5-22; Code 1996, § 78-52)

(4)
Submission of preliminary plat to building official. Four copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material specified, together with two copies of a written letter of application for conditional approval, shall be submitted to the building official.
(5)
Conditional approval. Conditional approval shall be given to the subdivider by the building official within five days after the submission of the written letter of application, preliminary plat and supplementary material when the proposed subdivision meets the design standards of the subdivision regulations established in this chapter. The action of the building official shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider and the other retained by the building official.
(6)
Preparation of final plat. After obtaining conditional approval from the building official, the subdivider may then proceed to prepare the final plat.
(7)
Omission of preliminary submission procedure. The preliminary submission procedure as prescribed in section 44-26 shall be omitted in the short-form subdivision procedure.
