Definitions.
(1)
Sign tree. A sign tree is a free standing sign having a single vertical support with horizontal appendages that are designed to suspend separate signs. For example, the vertical support of a tree sign should resemble the main stem of a tree and the horizontal appendages may resemble the tree limbs. Appendix A provides two examples of sign trees.
(2)
Primary intersection district. There is hereby established a primary intersection district that is designated within an area generally described as a corner of a primary intersection in the unincorporated county. For the purpose of this ordinance, a primary intersection is established where a state or federal route converges with a state route or county road. For example, and not to be limited to the forgoing, the corner of State Route 61 and State Route 166 forms a primary intersection. The primary intersection district (hereinafter PID), is further described as a triangular area having two sides running parallel to the public right-of-way for a distance of 20 feet to two points, which are further described as point A and point B, and a third side that connects point A and point B by a straight line.
(3)
Secondary intersection district. There is hereby established a secondary intersection district that is designated within an area generally described as a corner of a secondary intersection in the unincorporated county. For the purpose of this ordinance, a secondary intersection is established where a county road converges with another county road. For example, and not to be limited to the forgoing, the corner of North Van Wert Road and North Hickory Level Road forms a secondary intersection. The secondary intersection district (hereinafter SID), is further described as a triangular area having two sides running parallel to the public right-of-way for a distance of 20 feet to two points, which are further described as point A and point B, and a third side that connects point A and point B by a straight line.
