Any such disapproval by the engineer may be appealed to the director under section 86-105 of this chapter.
b.
Street lights shall have a high pressure "sodium" with a maximum of 10,000 lumen, unless a larger size lamp is needed for highway safety purposes and/or road intersections, as determined by the engineer.
c.
Spacing between the lights will vary from 250 feet to 500 feet, or approximately every other utility pole.
d.
The engineer shall not approve a final plat unless the subdivider submits proof of final payment to the utility company for construction and installation of the streetlights in the district, or a portion thereof where the development is phased.
(3)
Lights in or near public right-of-way. All lighting fixtures within or near the public rights-of-way shall be installed and operated in such a manner so as to prevent interference with the normal use of the public rights-of-way in any manner, including glare, location of blinds, and other such means of potential interference. The approval of the engineer shall be necessary before any person shall be authorized to install a security light or other such lighting fixture within the public right-of-way.
(4)
Special tax district. Where streetlights are required by this subsection (e), the subdivider shall apply to the county to establish a special tax districts for the provision of services of streetlight services within the development. The application for a special tax jurisdiction shall be reviewed and considered in accordance with the special tax district ordinance. The subdivider must receive the approval and designation of a special tax district prior to final plat approval.

ARTICLE VIII. - DESIGN STANDARDS FOR GREENSPACE LANDS[4]

Footnotes:
--- (4) ---
Editor's note— An ordinance of February 5, 2002, § 1, amended the title of art. VIII to read as herein set out.
Cross reference— Environment, ch. 38.

Sec. 86-141. - Applicability.
Where the standards set forth in this article do not address a particular question or issue, the standards set forth in article VII and other provisions of this chapter shall apply.
(Ord. of 10-16-01, § 1)
Sec. 86-142. - General design standards.
All greenspace lands design shall avoid or minimize adverse impacts on the county's natural, cultural and historic resources, as defined below.
(1)
Groundwater resources. All greenspace lands shall be designed to cause the least practicable disturbance to natural infiltration and percolation of precipitation to the groundwater table. The subdivider shall use vegetation, minimize land disturbance activities, and construct and install streets, buildings, and other impervious surfaces in locations other than those identified on the greenspace plan as having the greatest permeability where precipitation is most likely to infiltrate and recharge the groundwater.
(2)
Stream, swales, springs, and other lowland areas. The greenspace plan describes streams, including stream channels and flood plains, swales, springs and other lowland areas as resources that warrant restrictive land use controls because of flooding hazards to human life and property, ground water recharge functions, water quality and aquatic community health, and wildlife habitat.
a.
The following activities shall be minimized:
1.
Disturbance to streams and drainage swales.
2.
Disturbance to year-round wetlands, areas with seasonally high water tables, and areas of surface water concentration.
3.
Streams, swales and other lowland areas warrant designation as greenspace lands. Lands adjoining streams, swales and other lowland areas function as a buffer and should be included in the greenspace.
(3)
Woodlands. Woodlands occur extensively throughout the county, often in association with streams and wet areas, poor and erodible agricultural soils, and moderate to steep slopes.
a.
Woodland conditions vary with respect to species composition, age, stocking, and health. Woodlands range from relatively recent post-agricultural young stands to mature mixed-age forests. Most woodlands represent one or more of the following resource values:
1.
As soil stabilizers, particularly on moderate to steep slopes, thereby controlling erosion into nearby streams, ponds, impoundments and roads. A closely related function is their enhancement of ground water recharge.
2.
As a means of ameliorating harsh microclimatic conditions, in both summer and winter.
3.
As habitats for woodland birds, mammals and other wildlife.
4.
As recreation resources for walkers, equestrians, picnickers and other related outdoor activities.
5.
As visual buffers between areas of development and adjacent roads and properties.
b.
Woodlands on any tract proposed for greenspace lands shall be evaluated by the subdivider to determine the extent to which such woodlands should be designated partly or entirely as greenspace lands. Evaluation criteria shall include:
1.
Configuration and size.
2.
Present conditions (i.e., stocking, health, and species composition).
3.
Site potential (i.e., the site's capabilities to support woodlands), based upon its topographic, soil and hydrologic characteristics.
4.
Ecological functions (i.e., in protecting steep slopes, erodible soils, maintaining stream quality and providing for wildlife habitats).
5.
Relationship to woodlands on adjoining and nearby properties and the potential for maintaining continuous woodland areas.
c.
The evaluation of the tract's woodlands for greenspace lands shall be undertaken by a forester, landscape architect, horticulturist, arborist, or another qualified professional acceptable to the director. This evaluation shall be submitted as a report and made a part of the application for a preliminary plat. At a minimum, that report shall include one or more maps indicating boundaries and conditions of woodland areas accompanied by a report addressing the criteria in subsection 86-142(3)a above.
d.
In designing greenspace plan for any tract, the subdivider shall be guided by the following standards:
1.
Healthy woodlands exceeding one acre shall be preserved and designated as greenspace areas, to the maximum extent possible. Proposed site improvements shall be located, designed and constructed to minimize the loss or degradation of woodland areas.
2.
Greenspace lands shall be designed to preserve woodlands along roadways, property lines and lines occurring within a site such as streams, swales, hedgerows, and other natural boundaries. Such lines and the native vegetation associated with them shall be preserved as buffers between adjacent properties and between areas being subdivided within a property. Preservation shall include ground, shrub, understory, and canopy vegetation.
3.
Disturbance or removal of woodlands occupying environmentally sensitive areas shall be undertaken only when recommended by a qualified profession set forth in paragraph 86-142(3)c, and on a limited, selective basis to minimize the adverse impacts of such actions. This shall include but not necessarily be limited to, vegetation performing important soil stabilizing functions on wet soils, stream banks and sloping lands.
4.
No clearing or earth disturbance (except for soil analysis for proposed community wastewater system shall be permitted on a site before the preliminary plat approval, and if applicable, development agreements.
(4)
Rural-agricultural areas. An area comprising fields, pastures, meadows, and former agricultural areas in early stages of woodlands succession, with fences, and hedgerows, typically bordered by streams, draws, and woodlands. The rural-agricultural areas comprise the County's natural and historic resources, the rural landscape, pastoral family houses, barns and other structures. The rural-agricultural areas provide habitat for wildlife, in conjunction with nearby woodlands and streams.
a.
Several elements of these working landscapes lend themselves to incorporation into the county's greenspace network. These include prime agricultural soils and natural features that visually punctuate the landscape, such as hedgerows, rock outcrops, and visually prominent places such as knolls and hilltops.
b.
The rural-agricultural areas can accommodate development, with preferred locations being the non-prime agricultural soils and lower topographic settings where development will be visually less obtrusive. Compact clustered residential designs, with coordinated architectural and landscape architectural themes, are encouraged in highly visible locations where future development cannot be avoided (such as at the far edge of open fields).
(5)
Slopes. Moderately sloping lands (15 to 25 percent) and steeply sloping lands (over 25 percent) are prone to severe erosion if disturbed. Erosion and the resulting overland flow of soil sediments into streams, ponds and public roads, are detrimental to water quality and aquatic life, and a potential hazard to public safety.
a.
Areas of steep slope shall be preserved in accordance with the conservation overlay district of the zoning resolution and as required below.
b.
All grading and earthmoving on slopes exceeding 15 percent shall be minimized.
c.
No site disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding 25 percent except grading for a portion of a driveway accessing a single family dwelling when it can be demonstrated that no other routing which avoids slopes exceeding 25 percent is feasible.
d.
On slopes of 15 to 25 percent, the only permitted grading, not otherwise prohibited by this paragraph, shall be to site a single family dwelling, its access driveway, and the wastewater conveyance system.
e.
Grading on all sloping lands of 15 percent or greater shall not result in earth cuts or fills whose highest vertical dimension exceeds six feet, except where in the discretion of the director, no reasonable alternatives exist for construction of roads, drainage structures and other public improvements, in which case such vertical dimensions shall not exceed 12 ft. Roads and driveways shall follow the line of existing topography to minimize the required cut and fill. Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall be as required to minimize disturbance of natural grades.
(6)
Significant natural areas and features. Natural areas containing rare or endangered plants and animals, as well as other features of natural significance exist throughout the county. The subdivider shall take all reasonable measures to protect significant natural areas identified by the subdivider's conservation plan by incorporating them into proposed greenspace areas or avoiding their disturbance in areas proposed for development.
(7)
Historic structures and sites. The subdivider shall design to protect existing historic resources. The protection of an existing historic resource shall include the conservation of the landscape immediately associated with and significant to that resource, to preserve its historic context. Where, in the discretion of the director, a development will have an impact upon an historic resource, the developer shall mitigate that impact to the satisfaction of the director by modifying the design, relocating proposed lot lines, providing landscape buffers, or other approved means.
(8)
Historic rural road corridors and scenic viewsheds. The subdivider shall attempt to preserve the scenic visual corridors along such roads by incorporating them into greenspace areas or otherwise providing for building setbacks and architectural designs to minimize their intrusion. In instances, where such designs fail to satisfactorily protect corridors, subdividers shall be required to provide naturalistic landscape buffers to minimize their adverse visual impacts. The species specified for such buffers shall be selected on the basis of an inventory of tree and shrub species found in existing hedgerows and along wooded roadside edges in the vicinity of the development proposal.

ARTICLE X. - STORMWATER DETENTION REQUIREMENTS

Sec. 86-170. - Compliance.
Any submission for preliminary review and development application on or after September 3, 2014 shall comply with all applicable county ordinances pertaining to phase II municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) general permit GAG610000 and Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for the permitted area of the county.
(Ord. of 1-6-15, § 1)
Sec. 86-171. - Site grading—General requirements.
All design, construction, and installation of streets and stormwater conveyance facilities are subject to the standards of the public works department and approval of the public works department.
(1)
Grading shall be done in accordance with the lines and grades shown on the approved construction plans.
(2)
Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a compacted thickness of six inches per layer and shall be compacted to a density of 95 percent in all areas where structures, parking lots and drives, streets, and utilities are to be placed. All other embankments are to be compacted to at least 85 percent.
(3)
The maximum slopes for cut or fill shall be 2:1 (two feet of horizontal run for each foot of rise or fall). The depth of cut referred to herein shall be the maximum cut or fill occurring in any one section of cut or fill. The slope of cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill except when the engineer approves benching. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, the slope may be steeper if pre-splitting is employed and upon submission of a geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the steeper condition, subject to the review and approval of the engineer.
(4)
While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2:1 slope, some soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, non-cohesiveness, sliding, or inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or "grow mats" stapled in place) to maintain slope, height and integrity.
(Ord. of 10-16-01, § 1; Ord. of 1-6-15, § 1)
Sec. 86-172. - Stormwater detention.
(a)
Stormwater management report required.
(1)
Every project shall provide a stormwater management report prepared by professional engineer currently registered in the state. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage stormwater runoff so that stormwater runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed.
(2)
The stormwater management report shall include a written narrative and shall identify the locations and quantities of stormwater runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions. The report shall include a detailed summary statement of the increase or decrease in flow or runoff on adjacent properties and downstream drainageways. It shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and slope to define the boundaries of the site relative to watercourses, drainage divides, drainage structures, and other pertinent features.
(3)
The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainageway "immediately" downstream from the project. This area shall generally extend a flow distance of about one-half mile from the project's boundary line, but shall be longer for projects contributing relatively large amounts of runoff to the study area, and shorter for small runoff contributions. In all cases, the most critical downstream area investigation shall be conducted relative to existing and anticipated land use on tracts that adjoin the project site.
(b)
Stormwater detention required.
(1)
If the stormwater management report indicates that adverse stormwater runoff is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be required to provide stormwater detention facilities. These detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions.
(2)
The following criteria shall be evaluated by the engineer preparing the stormwater management report, and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of any site:
a.
Existing land uses downstream.
b.
Anticipated future land uses downstream.
c.
Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development.
d.
Presence of existing drainage problems.
e.
Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems.
f.
Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously.
g.
Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities.
h.
Existing flows generated off-site that pass through the project site.
i.
Anticipated future flows generated off-site that pass through the project site.
j.
The nature of the receiving watercourse.
(3)
Stormwater detention facilities shall be required for any portion of any site for which development activities will result in increased flows, unless the registered professional engineer currently registered in the state certifies and provides documentation supporting the conclusion to the engineer that the following is true and correct as applicable:
a.
The nondetained, postdevelopment runoff will leave the project site as sheet flow, and will not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties.
b.
The effect of detention would be to concentrate flows where sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions, and any impact of increase sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility even if energy dissipation devices were employed.
c.
The runoff will flow directly into a floodplain without crossing off-site properties, and the runoff will constitute less than five percent of the total runoff in the watercourse at the point where the watercourse crosses the project site's downstream property line.
d.
The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility that has been designed to manage the additional upstream property's runoff.
(c)
Detention design criteria—General.
(1)
All stormwater detention design calculations shall be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the state.
(2)
All stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to control the peak flow rates associated with storms having two-, ten-, 25-, 50- and 100-year return frequencies.
(3)
A variety of methods of achieving stormwater management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria:
a.
The type of development for which the detention facility is being provided.
b.
The type of development which the detention facility is intended to protect.
c.
Volume of stormwater to be stored.
d.
Origin and magnitude of the flows to be managed.
e.
Topographic opportunities and limitations.
f.
Safety considerations.
g.
Maintenance requirements.
h.
Aesthetic considerations.
i.
Likelihood of facility operation interfering with access to public or private facilities.
j.
Proximity of facility to property lines, utilities, buffers, etc.
k.
Similar site-specific constraints.
(4)
Detention facilities may be of any of the following types, and two or more types may be used in combination with one another:
a.
Normally-dry basins, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods.
b.
Lakes and ponds, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods.
c.
Other types of facilities shall be approved by the community development department.
(5)
Reservoir routing methods shall be used for all detention facility design.
(6)
The detention methodology required for any given project shall conform to standard engineering practices. It shall be the responsibility of the design engineer to use the correct coefficients and applications that will result in compliance with the requirements of this article and the intent of these regulations.
(7)
Runoff coefficients used for pre-and post-development conditions for the rational methods shall be consistent with standard engineering practices. For the SCS method the runoff curve numbers found in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" shall be used. For any stormwater analysis, the composite "C" (rational method) or CN (SCS method) used for predeveloped conditions shall not exceed 0.3 or 66, respectively, unless prior approval has been obtained through the department.
(8)
If either the rational method or the SCS method is used for detention design, calculations shall be provided showing how all times of concentration or lag times were computed, both for pre- and postdevelopment conditions. Likewise, adequate support must be provided for all composite runoff coefficients or curve numbers used.
(9)
If a computer program is used for detention design, including generation and routing hydrographs, the output from the program shall be summarized in the stormwater management report, and the name and version of the program shall be indicated. Computer output sheets may be attached to the report if desired by the design engineer or if requested by the development department.
(10)
The design of every detention facility of any type shall consider the effects both of inflows in excess of those the facility is designed to accommodate and of malfunctioning of the primary outlet system. A safe path for overflow condition flows shall be provided.
(d)
Detention facility location criteria.
(1)
Residential detention facilities shall be located outside the boundaries of a permitted building lot. Access shall be provided via a graded and grassed roadway not less than 12 feet wide and minimum grade practical within a 25-foot wide deeded property strip. Access shall not occur on any permittable building lot.
(2)
For purposes of these regulations, a detention facility shall be deemed to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any energy dissipation devices.
(3)
Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on-site that bypasses the facility.
(4)
No portion of any detention facility shall disturb any required buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area.
(5)
The 100-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not encroach upon a neighboring lot.
(6)
Detention facilities may encroach upon utility easements or rights-of-way, upon receipt by the engineer of written permission from both the property and utility owners.
(e)
Residential detention facility access requirements. Deeded property at least 25 feet in width shall be required to provide access to all residential detention facilities from a public street. This access shall be cleared, grubbed and/or graded so that it can be utilized by rubber-tired construction vehicles. Its location shall be as to minimize the amount of grading required.
(f)
Residential detention facility maintenance.
(1)
The detention storage capacity or function of any detention basin, pond or other impoundment, whether natural or man-made, shall not be removed or diminished without the express approval of the board of commissioners.
(2)

All residential detention facilities shall become the responsibility of the homeowner's association or the owner/developer for maintenance upon the county's approval of the final plat and the detention facility engineers certification and record (as-built) drawings.
(3)
In his discretion, the director may consider another entity other than a home owner's association to be responsible for maintenance of the detention facility.
(g)
Detention facility construction standards.
(1)
Stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the engineer, and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements. If the detention facility is planned to be a lake, temporary detention facilities shall be provided and shall remain in place until such time as the lake has become effective in providing stormwater management.
(2)
Within a detention basin, all stumps are to be cut flush with the ground or removed and all debris is to be removed below the ten-year ponding elevation. Trees or shrubs may be allowed to remain below the ten-year ponding elevation only upon certification of the survivability of the vegetation.
(3)
Detention slopes that are disturbed are to be grassed and the ground cover within the basin shall be well established with all exposed areas covered prior to the end of the maintenance period. All sloped shall be 3:1 maximum.
(4)
If the developer desires to place a fence around a detention facility, it shall be a minimum six-foot high fence of durable material, with a 12-foot wide access gate. Fencing may be required by the development department for hazardous detention ponds.

Acceptance of these plans by the County does not relieve permit holder from meeting all requirements of the "Carroll County Zoning Ordinance", "Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance", "Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance", the Rules and Regulations of the Carroll County Health Department, the US Army Crops of Engineers and any other local, state, or federal law or regulation as it relates to the development in Carroll County.
c.
The location of erosion and sediment control devices may have to be altered from that shown on the accepted plans due to changes in drainage patterns created during construction. It is the owner/developers responsibility to accomplish erosion and sediment control for all drainage patterns created at various states and phases during construction. Any difficulty in controlling erosion or sediment during any phase of construction shall be reported to the project engineer immediately. Failure to properly install, operate or maintain all erosion and sedimentation control measures may result in all construction being stopped until such measures are corrected to the satisfaction of the Carroll County inspector.
d.
Erosion control measures will be inspected at least weekly and after each rain, and repaired by general contractor.
e.
Detention/sediment pond(s) and diversion ditches shall be installed immediately after clearing for roadway construction. Detention pond(s) shall be retrofitted for siltation control. Engineer shall immediately follow-up with as-built certification for design compliance prior to acceptance of final plat.
f.
Owner agrees by implementation of these plans that all land clearing, construction, development and drainage activities will be done according to these accepted plans or previously accepted revisions. Owner acknowledges that acceptance of plans by the County in no way relieves owner of responsibility not to adversely impact downstream property regarding any land disturbing activity, erosion and sediment control measure and/or stormwater management activity during or after construction. Owner acknowledges that the acceptance of these plans and the issuance of this land disturbance permit does not in any way suggest that all other requirements for the legal or appropriate operations for this activity, which may require additional permitting or approvals may be necessary if any to operate from this point in an appropriate and legal manner. Plan acceptance or permit issuance does not absolve the applicant from complying with all applicable laws, policies, standards or other permits which may be required for this project.
g.
Any and all land disturbance permits may be revoked at any time if the construction of project is not in strict accordance with accepted plans.
h.
Drainage easements will be provided along all concentrated drainage paths a minimum width of 20'. Required widths and locations will be referenced and shown on final plat. Proposed drainage ditches will be provided with privately owned easements and are to be maintained and protected by individual lot owners. Notice of same shall be included on final plat and subsequent deeds of conveyance from the developer to the individual lot owners. Open drainage shall be 4:1 side slopes or flatter and fall entirely within easement. Residential fences and other flow obstructions are not allowed within drainage easements.
i.
The performance of all storm water drainage systems including detention facilities have been checked using the 100 - year storm (developed condition) for evaluation of local flooding and possible flood hazards to adjacent structures and/or property. The cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
j.
Acceptance of these plans does not constitute approval by Carroll County of any land disturbing activity within wetland areas. It is the owner's responsibility to contact the appropriate regulatory agency for approval of any wetland area disturbance.
k.
It is the owner's responsibility to ensure that all residential lots have sufficient grade and adequate drainage to prevent flooding of proposed structures and pertinent improvements such as on-site septic systems. Development shall notify builder of any special conditions relating to lot drainage and flooding potential.
l.
Owner/developer is responsible for maintaining control of silt on-site at all times. Developer is also responsible for control of silt that is tracked onto County R/W or subdivision streets by buildings, contractors, subcontractors, utility companies or any others during construction until street has been accepted by County Public Works Department.
m.
Maintain a minimum 2' of cover over storm pipes. All corrugated metal pipe to be maintained by county shall be full asphalt coated. Paved inverts are required in perennial streams. Pipe gage determined based on depth of cover and loading conditions.

APPENDIX K
GUIDELINES FOR CONSTRUCTING MULTI-USE PATHS
1.0 Introduction. The planning and design of multi-use paths must therefore take into account the various skills, experience and characteristics of these different users.
1.1 Where Paths Are Appropriate.
1.1.1 Well-planned and designed multi-use paths can provide good pedestrian and bicycle mobility. They can have their own alignment along streams and greenspace, or may be components of a community trail system.
1.1.2 Paths can serve both commuter and recreational cyclists. A separated path provides a learning ground for potential bicycle commuters and can attract experienced cyclists who prefer an aesthetic ride.
2.0 Components to a Multi-use Paths.
2.0.1 Continuous separation from traffic, by locating paths along a river or a greenbelt such as a rail-to-trail conversion, with few street or driveway crossings (paths directly adjacent to roadways are not recommended, as they tend to have many conflict points);
2.0.2 Scenic qualities, offering an aesthetic experience that attracts cyclists and pedestrians;
2.0.3 Connection to land-uses, such as shopping malls, downtown, schools and other community destinations;
2.0.4 Well-designed street crossings, with measures such as bike and pedestrian activated signals, median refuges and warning signs for both motor vehicles and path users;
2.0.5 Shorter trip lengths than the road network, with connections between dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs, or as short-cuts through open spaces;
2.0.6 Visibility: proximity to housing and businesses increases safety. Despite fears of some property owners, paths have not attracted crime into adjacent neighborhoods;
2.0.7 Good design, by providing adequate width and sight distance, and avoiding problems such as poor drainage, blind corners and steep slopes; and
2.0.8 Proper maintenance, with regular sweeping and repairs. The separation from motor vehicle traffic can reduce some maintenance requirements, such as sweeping the debris that accumulates on roads.
Example of Multi-Use Paths
2.0 IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
2.1 Crossings. The number of at-grade crossings with streets or driveways should be limited. Poorly designed crossings put pedestrians and cyclists in a position where motor vehicle drivers do not expect them at street crossings.
2.2 Access. Limiting crossing must be balanced with providing access. If a path is to serve bicyclists and pedestrians well, there should be frequent and convenient access to the local road network. Access points that are spaced too far apart will require users to travel out of direction to enter or exit the path. The path should terminate where it is easily accessible to and from the street system, e.g. at a controlled intersection or at the end of a dead-end street. Directional signs direct users to and from the path.
2.3 Security. Multi-use paths in secluded areas should be designed with personal security in mind. Illumination and clear sight distances improve visibility. Location markers, mileage posts and directional signing help users know where they are. Frequent accesses improve response time by emergency vehicles.
2.4 Maintenance. Multi-use paths require special trips for inspection, sweeping and repairs. They must be built to a standard high enough that allows heavy maintenance equipment to use the path without deterioration.
2.5 On-street Facilities. As bicyclists gain experience and realize some of the advantages of riding on the road, many stop riding on paths placed adjacent to roadways. This can be confusing to motorists, who may expect bicyclists to use the path. The presence of a nearby path should not be used as a reason to not provide adequate shoulders, bike lanes or sidewalks on the roadway.
2.6 Standards. Paths intended for multiple use by commuters and recreationists should be built to a standard that accommodates the various users with minimal conflicts. Designing to a low standard to save money can lead to problems if the path is popular. If usage is expected to be low, the need for a path should be reconsidered.
3.0 PATHS NEXT TO ROADWAYS
3.1 Concerns. Multi-use paths should not be placed next to roadways; half of the bicycle traffic will ride against the normal flow of motor vehicle traffic, which is contrary to the rules of the road, with the following consequences for bicyclists.
3.1.1 When the path ends, bicyclists riding against traffic tend to continue to travel on the wrong side of the street, as do bicyclists getting to a path. Wrong-way travel by bicyclists is a major cause of bicycle/automobile crashes and should be discouraged.
3.1.2 At intersections, motorists crossing the path often do not notice bicyclists coming from certain directions, especially where sight distances are poor.
3.1.3 Bicyclists on the path are required to stop or yield at cross-streets and driveways. Stopped motor vehicle traffic on a cross-street or driveway may block the path.
3.1.4 Because of the closeness of motor vehicle traffic to opposing bicycle traffic, barriers are often necessary to separate motor vehicles and bicyclists. These barriers are obstructions, complicate maintenance of the facility and waste available right-of-way.
3.2 Guidelines. Separated paths along roadways should be evaluated using the following guidelines:
3.2.1 Bicycle and pedestrian use is anticipated to be high;
3.2.2 The adjacent roadway is a heavily-traveled, high-speed thoroughfare where on-road bikeways and sidewalks may be unsafe;
3.2.3 The path will generally be separated from motor vehicle traffic, with few roadway or driveway crossings;
3.2.4 There are no reasonable alternatives for bikeways and sidewalks on nearby parallel streets;
3.2.5 There is a commitment to provide path continuity throughout the corridor;
3.2.6 The path can be terminated at each end onto streets with good bicycle and pedestrian facilities, or onto another safe, well-designed path;
3.2.7 There is adequate access to local cross-streets and other facilities along the route.
3.2.8 Any needed grade-separation structures do not add substantial out-of-direction travel; and
3.2.9 The total cost of providing the proposed path is proportionate to the need. This evaluation should consider the costs of:
a.
Grading, paving, drainage, fences, retaining walls, sound walls, signs and other necessary design features;
b.
Structures needed to eliminate at-grade crossings; and
c.
Additional maintenance, including the need for specialized maintenance equipment.
Notes: in many cases, the best choice is to improve the roadway system to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians, which may require connecting up local streets or improving nearby, parallel streets.
4.0 STANDARDS
4.1 Width & Clearances.
4.1.1 Width.
a.
High Traffic 3 m (10 ft) is the standard width for a two-way multi-use path; they should be 3.6 m (12 ft) wide in areas with high mixed-use. Faster-moving bicyclists require greater width than pedestrians; optimum width should be based on the relative use by these two modes. High use by skaters may also require greater width.
b.
Medium Traffic. The minimum width is 2.4m (8 ft). However, 2.4 m wide multi-use paths are not recommended in most situations because they may become over-crowded. They should only be constructed as short connectors, or where long-term usage is expected to be low, and with proper horizontal and vertical alignment to assure good sight distances.
c.
One-way paths. Although one-way paths may be intended for one direction of bicycle travel, they will often be used as two-way facilities, especially by pedestrians. Caution must be used in selecting this type of facility. If needed, they should be 1.8 m (6 ft) wide (min. 1.5 m [5 ft]) and designed and signed to assure one-way operation by bicyclists.
4.1.1 Lateral Clearance. A 1 m (3 ft) or greater (min. 0.6 m [2 ft]) "shy" or clear distance on both sides of a multi-use path is necessary for safe operation. This area should be graded to the same slope as the path to allow recovery by errant bicyclists.
4.1.2 Overhead Clearance. The standard clearance to overhead obstructions is 3 m (10 ft), min. 2.4 m (8 ft).
Multi-Use Path Standards
[4.1.3 Reserved.]
4.1.4 Separation from Roadway. Where a path is parallel and adjacent to a roadway, there should be a 1.5 m (5 ft) or greater width separating the path from the edge of roadway, or a physical barrier of sufficient height should be installed (see 4.6, Railings, Fences and Barriers).
4.2 Typical Pavement Sections.
4.2.1 The use of concrete surfacing for paths is best for long-term use. Concrete provides a smooth ride when placed with a slip-form paver. The surface must be cross-broomed. The crack-control joints should be saw-cut, not troweled. Concrete paths cost more to build than asphalt paths, but long-term maintenance costs are lower, since they do not become as brittle, cracked and rough with age, or deformed by roots and weeds as does asphalt.
4.2.2 Multi-use paths should be designed with sufficient surfacing structural depth for the subgrade soil type to support maintenance and emergency vehicles. If the path must be constructed over a very poor subgrade (wet and/or poor material), treatment of the subgrade with lime, cement or geotextile fabric should be considered.
Multi-Use Path Pavement Structure
4.3 Grades & Cross-Slope. AASHTO recommends a maximum grade of 5% for bicycle use, with steeper grades allowable for up to 150 m (500 ft.), provided there is good horizontal alignment and sight distance. Extra width is also recommended. Engineering judgment and analysis of the controlling factors should be used to determine what distance is acceptable for steep grades.
4.3.1 If use by pedestrians is expected, ADA requirements must be met; the grade of separated pathways should not exceed 5%, to accommodate wheelchair users.
4.3.2 Based on AASHTO recommendations and ADA requirements, 5% should be considered the maximum grade allowable for multi-use paths.
4.3.3 The standard cross-slope grade is 2%, to meet ADA requirements and to provide drainage. Curves should be banked with the low side on the inside of the curve to help bicyclists maintain their balance.
4.4 At-grade Crossings of Thoroughfares.
4.4.1 At-grade crossings introduce conflict points, and grade separation should be sought, as most path users expect continued separation from traffic. The greatest conflicts occur where paths cross freeway entrance and exit ramps. Motorists using these ramps are seeking opportunities to merge with fast moving traffic; they are not expecting bicyclists and pedestrians at these locations.
At-Grade Crossing of a Thoroughfare with Median Island
Path Curves to Improve Visibility at Signalized Intersection
4.4.2 When grade separation structures cannot be justified, signalization or other measures should be considered to reduce conflicts. Good sight distance must be provided so vehicle drivers can see approaching path users. One method is to provide a median island on multi-lane roadways as a refuge:
Where a path must cross a roadway at an intersection, improvements to the alignment should be made to increase the visibility of approaching path users. One method is to curve the path slightly, so that it is not parallel to the adjacent roadway:
4.5 Structures.
4.5.1 The width of multi-use path structures is the same as the approach paved path, plus a 0.6 m (2 ft) shy distance on both sides. For example, a 3 m (10 ft) wide path requires a 4.2 m (14 ft) wide structure.
Multi-Use Path Bridge
Undercrossing Dimensions
4.5.2 The standard overhead clearance of under-crossings is 3 m (10 ft); a 2.4 m (8 ft) min. may be allowable with good horizontal and vertical clearance, so users approaching the structure can see through to the other end. Undercrossings should be visually open for the personal security of users. Illumination is needed in areas of poor visibility.
4.5.3. Under-crossings.
a.
Advantages: They provide an opportunity to reduce approach grades, as the required 3 m (10 ft) clearance is less than the clearance required for crossing over a roadway. If the roadway is elevated, an undercrossing can be constructed with little or no grade. They are often less expensive to build.
b.
Disadvantages: They may present security problems, due to reduced visibility. An open, well-lighted structure may end up costing as much as an over-crossing. They may require drainage if the sag point is lower than the surrounding terrain.
Undercrossing Configurations
4.5.4 Over-crossings Advantages: They are more open and present fewer security problems.
Disadvantages: They require longer approaches to achieve the standard 5 m (17 ft) of clearance over most roadways. With an additional structural depth of 1 m (3 ft), the total rise will be 6 m (20 ft). At 5%, this requires a 120 m (400 ft) approach ramp at each end, for a total of 240 m (800 ft). This can be lessened if the road is built in a cut section. Note: 7m (23 ft) clearance is required over railroad tracks.
Overcrossing Configurations
4.6 Railings, Fences & Barriers.
4.6.1 Fences or railings along paths may be needed to prevent access to high-speed highways, or to provide protection along steep side slopes and waterways. A height of 1 m (4.5 ft) keeps a cyclist from falling over the railing or fence.
Railing with "Rub-Rail"
4.6.2 Openings in the railing must not exceed 150 mm (6") in width. Where a cyclist's handlebar may come into contact with a fence or barrier, a smooth, wide rub-rail may be installed at a height of 1 m (3 ft).
Adding Railing to a Barrier
4.6.3 Where concrete barriers are used, adding tube railing or chain link fencing may be necessary to achieve the required height.
"Cattle-chute" Effect
4.6.4 Fences should only be used where they are needed for safety reasons. They should be placed as far away from the path as possible. Duplication of fences should be avoided, such as fences on the right-of-way and fences to keep pedestrians off freeways.
4.6.5 Care must be taken to avoid a "cattle chute" effect by placing a high chain-link fence on each side of a path.
4.7 Preventing Motor-Vehicle Access
4.7.1 Geometric Design. One method branches the path into two narrower one-way paths just before it reaches the roadway, making it difficult for a motor vehicle to gain access to the path.
Split Path Discourages Motor-Vehicle Access
4.7.2 Short Curb Radii. Short curb radii (1.5 m [5 ft]) make it difficult for motorists to enter a path from the roadway.
4.7.3 Bollards. Barrier posts ("bollards") may be used to limit vehicle traffic on paths. However, they are often hard to see and cyclists may not expect them. When used, they must be spaced wide enough (min. 1.5 m [5 ft]) for easy passage by cyclists and bicycle trailers as well as wheelchair users. A single bollard is preferred, as two may channelize bicyclists to the middle opening, creating conflicts. They should not be placed right at the intersection. They should be painted with bright, light colors for visibility.
Short Curb Radius and Bollard at Entrance to a Path
4.7.4 Signing. Standard signing is often sufficient to inform motorists. Refer to page 153 for signing recommendations.
4.8 Curb Cuts. Curb cuts for bicycle access to multi-use paths should be built so they match the road grade without a lip. The width of the curb cut is the full width of the path when the approaching path is perpendicular to the curb and a minimum of 2.4 m (8 ft) wide when the approaching path is parallel and adjacent to the curb. Greater widths may be needed on downhill grades.
Curb Cuts for Paths
4.9 Drainage. Multi-use paths must be constructed with adequate drainage to avoid washouts and flooding, and to prevent silt from intruding onto the path.
4.10 Vegetation.
4.10.1 All vegetation, including roots, must be removed in the preparation of the subgrade. Special care is needed to control new growth, such as the use of soil sterilant or lime treatment of the subgrade. Plants that can cause other problems should be controlled, such as plants with thorns that can puncture bicycle tires.
4.10.2 Paths built in wooded areas present special problems. The roots of shrubs and trees can pierce through the surface and cause it to bubble up and break apart. Preventive methods include removal of vegetation, realignment of the path away from trees, and placement of root barriers along the edge of the path. An effective barrier is created with a 300 mm (12") deep metal shield; greater depth is required for some trees such as cottonwoods.
Path Adjacent to Trees
4.11 Paths with Heavy Use. If a path must handle a high number of users, it should be wider than standard (3.6 m or more). A separate soft-surface jogger or equestrian path may be constructed with bark mulch alongside the paved path.
Multi-Use Path with Additional Jogger/Equestrian Way
4.12 Stairways. Where a connection is needed to a destination or another path at a different elevation, a stairway can be used where the terrain is too steep for a path. A grooved concrete trough should be provided so bicyclists can easily push their bicycles up or down.
Stairway Provides Easy Access for Bicycles and Pedestrians
Note: Stairways are usually provided as a shortcut and do not meet ADA requirements; the destination should also be accessible along a flatter route, even if this route is longer and more circuitous.
Shared-Use Trails, Paved-Tread, Double-Track
Where paved service roads exist, this is the standard trail. The trails should be built out to this standard.
Shared-Use Trails, Natural Tread, Double-Track
Where no paved road exists, this is the standard trail.
Limited-Use Trails, Natural Tread, Single-Track
Single-track trails should be used only when space constraints prohibit a double-track trail. Generally this occurs only on trails cut out of hillsides.

APPENDIX L
WOODLANDS MANAGEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS FOR WILDLAND/URBAN INTERFACE
1
The intention of this section is to provide regulations for forest management within conservation subdivisions and provide guidelines for design to defend against wildfire.
2
Registered or consulting foresters [7] shall provide technical assistance in all phases of forest management and prepare a natural resource management plan. The plan should be based upon an ecosystem-based management approach whenever possible and/or upon the objectives of the county to include wildfire protection of threatened communities in the wildland/urban interface. The Forest Stewardship guidelines will be followed for the objectives of timber production, wildlife habitat, aesthetics, recreation, conservation or equal emphasis on all of the objectives mentioned, insofar as the size of the land area will allow such management objectives to be realistic options. The Stewardship designation (for properties that qualify) will be an objective of the management plan.
2.1
The elements of the management plan shall include, but not be limited to, resource assessment of the forest lands and the objectives to be obtained, wildlife management, recreational activities, and management constraints or options. The plan should assess the risk from wildfire based upon fuels and weather, to include the following areas; thinning, planting, herbicide application, prescribed burns, forest inventory, forest health, and wildlife habitat improvement.
2.2
Wildfire risk shall analyze adjacent land uses, vegetation/ecosystem type, fuel management, and prepare an emergency wildfire management plan based upon fire behavior, fuel breaks and water sources, evacuation plans, and designated safety zones.
2.2.1
The wildfire management plan should provide for a defensible space around the development. The wildfire plan should include the following:
a.
If practical, a 150-foot-wide area of shrub islands and thinned trees along any edges of the subdivision adjacent to fire-prone undeveloped land.
b.
A fuels removal plan (by prescribed fire or mechanical means), including ongoing fuel reduction measures (burning, mowing, thinning) in greenspace and rights-of-way management plans.
c.
A 20-foot cleared and perpetually maintained permanent firebreak with clearance on access paths to within 10 feet of water features for heavy fire-fighting equipment use.
d.
A defensible space that may include:
(1)
Trees and shrubs that provide shade and attract wildlife.
(2)
A canopy of large trees while reducing the ground-level vegetative fuels that can carry a fire.
(3)
Less flammable plants may be substituted to gain fire prevention, water conservation, and wildlife habitat benefits.
(4)
Ponds, wetlands, streets, utility corridors, and mowed areas may serve as fuel breaks.
3
Greenspace should be one large contiguous tract rather than scattered small areas. This provides for more efficient fuel management, better wildlife habitat, and development of a recreational area for residents.
4
A pre-construction prescribed burn (conducted in compliance with applicable EPD burning restrictions), installation of permanent firebreaks and walking trails and thinning of pine trees should be conducted under the supervision of the forester or the local permitting agency.
5
It is recommended that the community covenants and restrictions, include wildfire prevention measures to govern the appropriate placement of structures, management of vegetation, maintenance of defensible space, burning of yard waste, and fire-wise structures. Fire-wise structures shall avoid using combustible or heat-sensitive building materials such as vinyl or wood siding and soffits, vinyl soffit vents, or wood shingles. Brick, concrete, rock, stucco, or metal (roofing or screen soffit vents) are preferred building materials for homes adjacent to fire-prone undeveloped areas. Spark-arresting screens should be placed on chimneys, hose bibs should be on all sides of the structure, and a 30 feet fire-safe area established around the dwelling for combustible items such as propane tanks, woodpiles, or flammable materials.
