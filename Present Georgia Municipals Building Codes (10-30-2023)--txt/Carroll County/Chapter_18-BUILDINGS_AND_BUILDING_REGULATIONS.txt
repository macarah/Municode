(Res./Ord. of 6-3-03, § 2)
Sec. 18-13. - Code remedial.
(a)
General. The construction codes are hereby declared to be remedial, and shall be construed to serve the following purposes, among others:
(1)
To protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the county through structural strength, stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation.
(2)
To assure the safety to life and property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment including alteration, repair, removal, demolition, use and occupancy of buildings, structures, or premises by regulating the installation and maintenance of all electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems, which may be referred to as service systems.

(c)
Permitting and inspection. The inspection or permitting of any building, system or plan, under the requirements of construction codes shall not be construed in any court as a warranty of the physical condition of such building, system or plan or their adequacy. [Neither t]he county, nor any employee thereof, shall be liable in tort for damages for any defect or hazardous or illegal condition or inadequacy in such building, system or plan, nor for any failure of any component of such, which may occur subsequent to such inspection or permitting.
(Res./Ord. of 6-3-03, § 2)
Sec. 18-14. - Scope.
(a)
Applicability.
(1)
Building permit required. Except where expressly exempted, any owner, authorized agent, or contractor who desires to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or structure, the bearing walls, the exterior walls or the roof or the size of the building, or to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert or replace any electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system, the installation of which is regulated by the construction codes, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make application to the building official and obtain the required permit (and certificate of zoning compliance) before beginning the work. No building permit shall be issued unless the applicant has satisfied all rules, regulations, and requirements of the zoning regulations, other county ordinances, and provided the requisite information as required by this division.
(2)
Bonding requirement. Before issuing a building permit, the building official will determine if any bonding (either performance or maintenance) is necessary to protect public property from damage. If no bond is being held by the county for protection of the public property, the building official may require a bond or cash deposit to be furnished to insure that any damage to streets, sidewalks or other affected public property will be repaired, and that the surface of such places will be restored to its original condition upon completion of the work. The bond or other financial security shall have an AM Best Rating of A-6 or higher and approved by the county attorney and have been deposited with an agent approved by the building official equal to the cost of estimated construction of the public improvements. The bond amount shall be calculated by the director. Such cash deposits, escrow account or other instrument shall be accompanied by an agreement in writing directed to the county containing in substance the same terms and conditions as provided, however, that sufficient funds are retained in said cash deposit of escrow account to complete construction of all required improvements. Upon completion and satisfactory inspection of all affected public property improvements, all funds remaining in said deposit of account shall be returned to the depositor.
(3)
General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of these construction codes specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.

(h)
Conditions of the permit.
(1)
Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, or other applicable law or ordinances, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the worked is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building official.
(2)
Permit issued on basis of a certificate of a design professional. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon a certificate of a design professional or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the design professional who signed the certificate or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official a certificate that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official.
(3)
Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he/she shall enforce, in writing or by stamp on all sets of plans or drawings that such plans or drawings have been reviewed and indicate that such plans or drawings have been approved or denied. The building official shall retain one set and the remaining sets shall be returned to the applicant. A copy of the approved plans or drawings shall be kept on the site of construction or work at all times and shall be made available for review when requested by the building official or designee.
(i)
Fees.
(1)
Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the board of commissioners have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, etc. has been paid.
(2)
Work commencing before permit issuance.
