Procedure for consideration of and action on applications.
(1)
The county may make such investigations and take or authorize the taking of such other steps as the commission deems necessary or appropriate to consider and act on applications for franchises and determine whether a franchise should be granted to an applicant, and may require the applicant to furnish additional information and data for this purpose.
