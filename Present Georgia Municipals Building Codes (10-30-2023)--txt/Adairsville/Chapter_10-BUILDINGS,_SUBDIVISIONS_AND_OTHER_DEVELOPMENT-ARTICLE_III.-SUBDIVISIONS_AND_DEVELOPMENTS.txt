Sec. 10-125. - Subdivision and development plats.
General overview of subdivisions and development plat review and approval procedures.
(1)
Introduction. The procedure for the formal review and approval of a subdivision or development plat consists of the following stages:
a.
Pre-application review;
b.
Preliminary plat acceptance by the unified zoning board;
c.
Construction plan approval by the community development director;
d.
As-built plan approval by the community development director;
e.
Final plat acceptance by the unified zoning board and approval by the mayor and city council; and
f.
Recording and dedication.
(2)
Minor subdivision or development. Minor subdivisions or developments are lot divisions that do not require the installation of streets, utilities, or other public improvements and infrastructure. A proposal to create a minor subdivision or development shall only require review and approval by the community development director before being recorded in the public records of the clerk of the county superior court. The community development director will approve the minor subdivision or development if the submitted plat complies with state law pertaining to the recording of plats and all of the substantive requirements of this article.
(3)
Pre-application review stage. Whenever the subdivision or development of a tract of land is proposed, the subdivider or developer shall consult informally with the community development director prior to filing the application for subdivision or development. The subdivider or developer may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed development layout of the subdivision or development. The purpose of the pre-application review stage is to facilitate the subsequent preparation of plans and plats by clarifying matters relating to the proposed subdivision or development.
(4)
Preliminary plat stage. The subdivider must submit to the unified zoning board for approval a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision or development prepared in accordance with the provisions of this article. If the proposed subdivision or development abuts a state highway, a certificate of approval by the state department of transportation must accompany the preliminary plat submission. The county health department must have reviewed the project, and a letter of preliminary approval must be obtained by the subdivider. The subdivider must also furnish copies of such a preliminary plat to all utility companies serving the area. Approval of the unified zoning board will be indicated on the face of the preliminary plat.
(5)
Construction plan stage. Prior to making any street improvements or installing any utilities or other improvements, the subdivider or developer must submit to the community development director construction plans of the proposed subdivision or development, prepared in accordance with the provisions of this article. The design presented in the construction plans must be in conformance with the general design information presented in the preliminary plat that was approved by the unified zoning board. The construction plans must show all street design profiles, topographic information, utility construction plans, sediment and erosion control plans, and other information as may be required by the community development director. The construction plans shall be approved by the community development director upon finding that they are in compliance with all requirements of the city's codes and design specifications.
(6)
As-built plan stage. After making street improvements and utility installation, and before final plat approval, the subdivider shall submit as-built plans that demonstrate that construction has been performed consistently with the approved construction plans and these development regulations. The community development director will review the plans and the work performed to verify compliance prior to allowing final plat to be presented to the unified zoning board.
(7)
Final plat stage. After completion of the physical development, or arrangements for physical development acceptable to the unified zoning board, of all or part of the area shown on the preliminary plat as approved by the unified zoning board, and before selling any lots, a final plat together with the required certificates must be submitted to the unified zoning board and the mayor and city council for approval. The subdivider must also furnish copies of the approved final plat to all utility companies serving the area.
(8)
Recording and dedication. After the final plat is approved by the mayor and city council, the final plat and appropriate documents become the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county superior court. After recording, the appropriate deeds and documents must be presented to the appropriate local government agency for dedication and acceptance.
(9)
Redline comments. Whenever a plat is resubmitted after being denied or returned with redline comments, the subdivider or developer shall provide a letter of explanation as to how the comment has been addressed.
