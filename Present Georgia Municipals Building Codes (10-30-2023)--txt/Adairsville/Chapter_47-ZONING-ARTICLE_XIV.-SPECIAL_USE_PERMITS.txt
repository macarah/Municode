ARTICLE XIV. - SPECIAL USE PERMITS

Sec. 47-393. - Procedures.
(a)
An applicant for a special use permit shall file an application on forms provided by the community development director. The grant or denial of a special use permit shall follow the procedures for a rezoning, as specified in sections 47-361 through 47-365, unless modified by the provisions of this article, provided that notice of the public hearing shall be provided to the owner of the property that is the subject of the application by mail at least 30 days prior to the public hearing, and the sign and published notice shall be posted at least 30 days prior to public hearing.
(b)
Any use which may be authorized by a special use permit may be approved by the mayor and city council only if, in the exercise of the mayor and city council's discretion, they find that:
(1)
A proper application has been filed in accordance with the requirements of this article;
(2)
A recommendation has been received from the unified zoning board in accordance with the provisions of article XIII of this chapter;
(3)
The applicant is in compliance with the particular conditions for the proposed special use that are required by this article;
(4)
The use is consistent with the purposes and intent of this article; and
(5)
After considering the application and the facts, and the standards for making a zoning decision contained in section 47-367, the mayor and city council determine that the standards are satisfied such that the benefits of and need for the proposed special use outweigh any possible harmful effects, negative impacts, or damages to the neighboring properties or the city in general. In making this determination, the city council may consider the effects of the proposed use on traffic, public infrastructure and services, aesthetics, property values, the peaceful enjoyment of private property in the community, and other relevant factors.
(c)
An application for an industrial use that is otherwise permitted by right in Ind-G or Ind-H nevertheless requires a special use permit when the particular development meets the definition of a development of regional impact (DRI) in the metropolitan tier of the rules and regulations of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. This is because such uses have the potential to have significant impacts both to the city and the region. The UZB shall not hold its public hearing until after DRI review has been received from the Northwest Georgia Regional Commission. In addition to the standards for the exercise of the zoning power and standards in paragraph (b) above, the applicant should address, and the UZB and mayor and city council should consider, any comments received or recommendations made as part of the DRI review.
