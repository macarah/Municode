Notice of an application for a special variance shall be given by the chief or the chief's representative to persons who frequent the area of the sound or activity and who may be adversely affected by the granting of the variance. Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may file a statement with the chief or the chief's representative containing any information to support such individual's claim.
(3)
In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the chief or the chief's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the chief or the chief's representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the chief or the chief's representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance.
(4)
Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this article regulating the source of sound or activity for which the special variance was granted.
(5)
Application for extension of time limits specified in special variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial special variances.
(6)
The chief of police or the chief's designated representative may issue guidelines approved by city council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether or not to grant a special variance.

Sec. 18-45. - Graffiti.
(a)
Purpose and intent.

Graffiti promotes blight in the neighborhoods in which it occurs and encourages similar acts of vandalism. Without prompt removal of graffiti, other properties become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to live and work.
(2)
The council members of the city in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare further find and declare that to be truly effective in the deterrence, eradication, and removal of graffiti, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive anti-graffiti ordinance.

The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners:

(f)
Accepted graffiti removal products.
(1)
The planning and zoning department shall maintain a list of substances designated as acceptable products to remove specific types of graffiti from specific surfaces (unpainted brick, concrete, stone, etc.). This list shall include detailed information on the appropriate use of such designated substances. Appropriate use of said substances by property owners shall constitute compliance with the requirement to remove graffiti contained therein.
(2)
Uses of any of these items or any other items are at the risk of the user. The city does not recommend the products. Use may discolor or damage the finish of the surface the products are used on.
(g)
City cost declared lien. If the person, agent, firm, manager, or owner of the property fails to remove the graffiti by the end of the ten-day notification period, the city manager may cause the graffiti to be removed and charge to the property owner the expenses incurred. Upon the completion of removal by the city, the city shall provide the proper party written notice consistent with subsections (d) and (e) of this section of the total cost of removal and shall give the proper party 30 days to pay the total cost incurred by the city.

ARTICLE III. - FALSE ALARMS

Sec. 18-68. - Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Burglar alarm system means any assembly of equipment or device, whether mechanical or electrical, arranged or designed to signal by any means the occurrence of an illegal entry into the premises or any other activity requiring urgent police attention and to which the police department may reasonably be expected to respond; provided, however, that this definition does not include alarm systems installed exclusively for the purpose of signaling an ongoing robbery, fire or medical emergency, and does not include any alarm system installed in a motor vehicle.
Burglar alarm user means the person or other entity which owns, leases, rents, manages, possesses, or has primary control over the premises in which a burglar alarm system is installed or maintained.
Chief of police means the chief of the county police, county sheriff or the chief of police of the city police department, if such department is established, or his designee.
False alarm means the activation of a signal from a burglar or fire alarm system which elicits a response from the police or fire and rescue department when there is in fact no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity necessitating such a response. This definition includes, without being limited to, any burglar alarm system signal activated as a result of weather, negligence, accident, mechanical failure, electrical failure, electrical surge, signals activated intentionally in non-emergency situations, and signals activated where the actual cause of such activation is unknown. There is a rebuttable presumption that an activated burglar or fire alarm system signal is a false alarm if the responding personnel, after following normal procedures in their response and investigation, find no evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity or other emergency. An activated alarm system signal shall not be considered a false alarm if:
(1)
The police or fire and rescue department is notified to cancel its response by the alarm user or the alarm user's monitoring agent prior to the time emergency personnel arrive at the premises;
(2)
The burglar or fire alarm system signal was intentionally activated by an individual based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response existed;
(3)
The burglar or fire alarm system signal was activated by lightening or other act of nature resulting in an electrical surge which causes physical damage to the alarm system and which damage is evidenced by the written report of a licensed alarm system contractor who conducted an inspection of the system at the premises and personally observed such physical damage.
Fire alarm means any assembly of equipment or device, whether mechanical or electrical, arranged or designed to signal by any means the occurrence of a fire at the premises.
Police department means the county police department, county sheriff or city police department, if such department is established.
Premises means the building or structure or any portion of a building or structure in which there is installed or maintained a burglar alarm system.
(Ord. No. 07-12-09, art. 2, § 1, 12-12-2007; Ord. No. 11-03-83, art. 2, § 1, 3-1-2011; Ord. No. 12-11-111, art. 2, § 1, 11-6-2012)
Sec. 18-69. - Purpose and intent.
Based on the experiences of surrounding municipalities and communities and their law enforcement officers, the council finds that emergency response to false alarms creates additional risks to public safety by diverting limited public safety resources away from both real emergencies and normal patrol activities intended and designed to prevent criminal acts. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to promote public safety by making burglar and fire alarm users in the city directly responsible for preventing false alarms.
(Ord. No. 07-12-09, art. 2, § 2, 12-12-2007; Ord. No. 11-03-83, art. 2, § 2, 3-1-2011; Ord. No. 12-11-111, art. 2, § 2, 11-6-2012)

(2)
The names of all persons authorized to enter the premises and deactivate the alarm system signal as well as all phone numbers at which such persons can be reached;
(3)
The name and telephone number of the alarm user's monitoring agent, if any; and
(4)
If known, the name and telephone number of the person or entity which installed the alarm system.

Burglar or fire alarm users utilizing alarm systems installed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall provide the information set forth in subsection (a) of this section to the chief of police no later than 60 days following such effective date, unless sooner requested in writing by the chief of police.
(c)
The registration requirements of this subsection shall not apply where the alarm system is installed in premises used exclusively for residential purposes; provided, however, upon the occurrence of the third false alarm within any calendar year at any such premises used exclusively for residential purposes, the chief of police is authorized to require in writing that the alarm user comply with the registration requirements within five business days.
(d)
All alarm systems installed before incorporation of the city shall be registered with the chief of police within six months after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. The city may authorize the city manager to obtain the registration information from the police chief of the county.
(Ord. No. 07-12-09, art. 2, § 3, 12-12-2007; Ord. No. 12-11-111, art. 2, § 3, 11-6-2012)

Sec. 18-73. - Prohibitions.
(a)
It shall be a violation of this article for any burglar or fire alarm user to cause, allow or permit three or more false alarms in any calendar year. It shall also be a violation of this article for any burglar or fire alarm user to fail or otherwise refuse to comply with the registration or equipment requirements set forth in sections 18-70 and 18-71.

For the third and each subsequent false alarm that occurs at the same premises within any 12-month period, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of $50.00; provided, however, that no burglar alarm user shall be assessed fines in excess of $200.00 for false alarms that occur at the same premises in any 24-hour period.
(2)
For all other violations of this article, not including false alarms, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of $100.00 and, in addition thereto, the violator may be enjoined by the municipal court judge from continuing the violation.

(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination.

Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)

The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.

The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(2)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(3)
The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(4)
