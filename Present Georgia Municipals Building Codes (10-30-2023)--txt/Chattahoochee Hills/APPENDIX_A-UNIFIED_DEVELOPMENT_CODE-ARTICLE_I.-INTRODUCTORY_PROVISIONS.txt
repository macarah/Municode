Sec. 1-16. - Nonconformities.
A.
Generally.
1.
Within the zoning districts established by this UDC, or in other provisions or amendments, there exist lots, uses of land, uses of land and buildings, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of buildings and structures that were lawful before this UDC and the subsequent official zoning map were adopted, but that would be prohibited under the terms of this UDC or future amendments.
2.
Such nonconforming situations are hereby declared to be incompatible with authorized and permitted uses and regulations within the districts involved. It is the intent of the city to require the cessation of certain of these nonconforming situations, and to allow others to continue, on a limited basis, until they are otherwise removed or cease. It is further the city's intent that nonconforming situations not be used as grounds for adding other buildings, structures, or uses of land prohibited by this UDC, and that no such nonconforming building, structure, or use of land be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity.
B.
Nonconforming open uses of land. Nonconforming uses consisting of lots used for storage yards, used car lots, auto wrecking, junk yards, golf driving ranges, miniature golf and similar open uses where the only buildings on the lot are incidental and accessory to the open use of the lot and where such use of the land is not permitted to be established hereafter under this UDC in the district in which it is located, shall be governed by the following restrictions in addition to the other requirements in this UDC:
1.
When any portion of a nonconforming open use of land has been changed to a conforming use, said portion shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.
2.
No nonconforming open use of land shall be enlarged to cover more land than was previously occupied by such nonconforming use.
3.
When any portion of a nonconforming open use of land is discontinued for a continuous period in excess of one year, any future use of such land shall be limited to those uses permitted in that district under the provisions of this UDC. Vacancy and/or non-use of the land, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision, unless such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to such land.
C.
Reversions and changes. Any nonconforming use, use of land or building in combination, open use of land, use of land and structure in combination, nonconforming lot of record, or nonconforming characteristic ("nonconforming situations") that is changed to a conforming state shall not be permitted to revert to a nonconforming situation. No nonconforming situation shall be changed to another nonconforming situation.
D.
Nonconforming use of land and building/structure in combination. The following regulations apply to the nonconforming use of land and buildings in combination and the nonconforming use of land and structures in combination:
1.
Such uses of land and buildings or land and structures may be continued, but no such use which has been discontinued for a continuous period of one year shall be reestablished unless such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the property.
2.
Such uses of land and buildings or land and structures, or any such building or structure, shall not be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity.
3.
A nonconforming use of a building may be extended into those interior parts of a building which were constructed and manifestly designed for such use prior to the enactment of the ordinance from which this UDC is derived.
E.
Nonconforming characteristics of buildings, structures and uses. No building, structure or use with nonconforming characteristics shall be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity.
F.
Area extensions prohibited. A nonconforming use, or building or structure in combination with a use, or building or structure with nonconforming characteristics, shall not be extended or enlarged beyond the area of use or beyond the conforming size, height, or other dimensions or characteristics of the building or structure as it existed on the effective date of this UDC or amendments applicable thereto rendering such situations nonconforming.
G.
Reconstruction. Any building or structure constituting a nonconforming use of land and building, nonconforming use of land and structures, or building or structure with nonconforming characteristics that has been unintentionally damaged by fire or natural causes such as flood or storms, may be reconstructed to its previous nonconforming characteristics and used as it was prior to damage if development permits for the reconstruction are applied for within one year of the date of the damage.
H.
Buildings and structures. Nothing in this UDC shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by the zoning administrator.
I.
Lots.
1.
Lot frontage. Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be located on a lot that fronts on a thoroughfare, open space, civic space, or cottage court mews, except that up to 12 single-family residential lots in the rural (RL) district may front an access easement that connects to a thoroughfare or open space. Alleys may not be used to satisfy this requirement. All structures shall be located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing and fire protection.
2.
Lot reduction prohibited. No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that the front, side, or rear yards, or other requirements of this UDC are not maintained. Yards or lots created after the effective date this UDC shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this UDC. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for a public purpose.
3.
Lots not meeting minimum lot size requirements. When a lot has an area which does not conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located (see section 6-3E), but was a lot of record on the effective date of this UDC or upon amendments thereto, such lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located provided that all other requirements of this UDC are met.
