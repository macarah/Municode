New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after the date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is built on a single chassis, which contains 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, is designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and is designed primarily as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use and not for use as a permanent dwelling.
Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements), under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act 16 USC 3501 et seq., includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The term "actual start" means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as, garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the term "actual start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank or other manmade facilities or infrastructures.
Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during the life of a building in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building. The market value of the building should be:
(1)
The appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
(2)
In the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the fire and structural safety inspector and which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means an existing manufactured home park or subdivision in which the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or improvement of the streets, utilities, and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities, and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 107-81. - Floodway.
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 107-5, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway.
(2)
Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
(3)
Only if subsection (2) of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.
(Ord. No. 2008-08-01, ยง I(3-7), 8-28-2008)
Sec. 107-82. - StandardsโStreams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways.
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established by this section 107-5 where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been provided, the following provisions shall apply.
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 107-5, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions, subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply:
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the streambank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 107-79, pertaining to elevated buildings.
(4)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

Sec. 107-83. - SameโSubdivision proposals.
(a)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(c)
All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(d)
For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.
(Ord. No. 2008-08-01, ยง I(3-9), 8-28-2008)
Sec. 107-84. - SameโAreas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 107-5, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 107-79, pertaining to elevated buildings. The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in section 107-41(b)1c and (b)2.
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. 2008-08-01, ยง I(3-10), 8-28-2008)
Sec. 107-85. - SameโCritical facilities.
(a)
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain.
(b)
All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.
(Ord. No. 2008-08-01, ยง I(3-11), 8-28-2008)
Sec. 107-86. - SameโCoastal high hazard areas (V zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 107-5, are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge; therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.
(2)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (6) of this section.
(3)
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or shear walls.
(4)
All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (nonstructural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the standard building code.
(5)
A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in subsections (2), (3) and/or (4) of this section.
(6)
All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed:
a.
No solid walls shall be allowed; and
b.
Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only.
If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises.
(7)
Prior to construction, plans for any structures having latticework or decorative screening must be submitted to the administrator for approval.
(8)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section.
(9)
There shall be no fill used as structural support. Noncompacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered:
a.
Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction;
b.
Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and
c.
Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping.
(10)
There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage.
(11)
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of this section are met.
