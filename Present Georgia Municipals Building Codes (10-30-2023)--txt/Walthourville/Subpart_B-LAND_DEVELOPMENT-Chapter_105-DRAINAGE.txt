(Ord. No. 97-03-01, § 5, 3-11-1997)
Sec. 105-2. - Statutory authorization.
By the Constitution of Georgia, article IX, section II, chapter 2-49, local governmental units are given the authority and responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry and specifically with regard to water drainage, collection and disposal.
(Ord. No. 97-03-01, § 1, 3-11-1997)
Sec. 105-3. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The city is subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages.
(c)
Increased velocities and quantities of water draining off developed land causes erosion, sedimentation and maintenance problems resulting in significant damages.
(d)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(e)
Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff.
(f)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
(g)
Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of a storm sewer system.
(h)
Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the storm sewer system.
(Ord. No. 97-03-01, § 2, 3-11-1997)
Sec. 105-4. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote, protect, maintain and enhance the short-term and long-term public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion, flood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damages at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, wetlands, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Comply with state (DNR) and federal (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These requirements include:
a.
Control the contribution of pollutants to the storm sewer system by stormwater discharges associated with commercial and industrial activity and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites of commercial and industrial activity;
b.
Prohibit illicit connections to storm sewers;
c.
Control discharge to storm sewers of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and
d.
Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one city system to another.

Sec. 105-6. - Statement of policy objectives.
The enactment and enforcement of this chapter is intended to address the following policy objectives:
(1)
To recognize the necessity of and to encourage joint action and a full exchange of information by the city and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems, the prevention of their worsening or recurrence and the implementation of these objectives;
(2)
To work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the objective stated in subsection (1) of this section by encouraging through this chapter and other public actions the development of on-site self-maintaining retention/detention facilities and for off-site centrally located regional retention/detention facilities;
(3)
To maintain, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, where feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions;
(4)
To incrementally assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system;
(5)
To require of the development industry the responsibility to maintain the functioning of the storm drainage system;
(6)
To encourage the construction of joint retention/detention ponds serving several properties which can be accepted for maintenance by the city upon completion of project development. The city encourages where engineering judgment so warrants the location of these retention facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate in the construction of major retention facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems;
(7)
To encourage innovative design solutions to the effective retention and reduction of runoff. Drainage control measures to retain, reduce and regulate the rate of stormwater discharge which shall be acceptable shall include, but need not be limited to, retention/detention ponds percolation facilities, parking lots, open space areas, and oversized storm drains with restricted outlets. In addition, the city encourages the development of retention facilities in such a manner that they will become aesthetically and recreationally beneficial to the community in which they are located; and
(8)
To require any development to retain any runoff which exceeds an allowable increase of one cubic foot per second per acre caused by the development and to utilize the parking area or privately owned retention/detention facility.

ARTICLE III. - STANDARDS, FACILITIES, AND PROHIBITED CONNECTIONS

Sec. 105-59. - Standards.
(a)
All engineering design items for storm drainage and erosion control and sedimentation control and delineation of the 100-year floodplains shall meet the applicable minimum requirements available from the county consolidated planning commission. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the National Weather Service for the affected area.
(b)
A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction which will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second per acre for a 25-year frequency (type II) storm. This shall not apply to individual single-family lots of less than two acres.
(c)
The release rate of stormwater from all developments where detention is required shall:
(1)
Not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the area in its existing state for all intensities up to, and including, the 25-year frequency for all durations of rainfall; or
(2)
Not be greater than that calculated for a 25-year (type II) frequency storm with a runoff coefficient of 0.20, 0.25 and 0.35 for land with an average slope of up to two percent.
(d)
The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a (type II) storm of 25-year design frequency except for areas considered to be major drainage canals. The major drainage canals shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 100-year frequency.
(e)
Land uses within the 100-year floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream, its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other drainage facilities or systems and shall not increase the 100-year elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the 100-year floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the 100-year floodplain. Altered sections of the 100-year floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow line and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt build-up.
(f)
The live retention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 25-year frequency rainfall as published by the National Weather Service for the affected areas. The retention system required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 25-year rainfall, for any and all durations from the proposed development, with a release rate that does not exceed the pre-development runoff. Retention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. Retention/detention control structures shall be sized for the release rate as presented in previous sections and will have provisions for overflow of the 100-year storm without damage to the structure.
(g)
When the developer requests and the county consolidated planning commission determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined retention or other drainage facilities more practical, the city may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. This authorization shall be granted by the county consolidated planning commission upon application for approval being submitted through the planning commission. Where joint retention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the retention facility, except upon approval of the county consolidated planning commission.
(h)
When adequacy of existing drainage structures are being considered in association with proposed development, the overall capacity of the structure will be evaluated and divided among upstream properties. The available capacity will be divided among property owners based on acreage in the basin. Under no condition will the available capacity of the structure be exceeded. Should the developer desire to replace the structure in lieu of retention/detention, all downstream structures should be evaluated and deemed adequate. The developer will be responsible for providing calculations and studies needed to evaluate downstream structures. If an existing structure not being modified by the development is found to be inadequate to handle the pre-development flows, the developer shall provide calculations to show the structure size required to handle the pre-development flows of the entire basin area. The city at that time will evaluate its ability to modify that structure. This evaluation will take into consideration available funds, required permits, capabilities of downstream structures and current work loads. Based on the county's findings, the developer will be notified within 45 days of the county's intentions for modification and any schedule required for modification of structures.
(i)
The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all retention, detention and sedimentation control facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater runoff:
(1)
Permanent chain-link fencing at least six feet in height shall be required around all these facilities. This fencing shall be designed, installed and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment, if intended, into the facility. The fence shall include a lockable gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities, 12-foot minimum. Different fencing material may be substituted for chain link upon approval of the county consolidated planning commission. requirements for fencing may be waived if deemed necessary by the mayor and city council.
(2)
These facilities shall be located on tracts of land, designated for this use on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access easement shall provide at least 20 feet of width outside of above-ground obstructions including trees, utility poles, fences, buildings, headwalls, weirs, settling basins, top of slopes, or other drainage structures.
(3)
Perforated standpipes or a French drain, as approved by the county engineer, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing of water and/or inadequate drainage shall be installed within all these facilities.
(4)
Except as provided in subsection (i)(5) of this section, the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of these retention facilities during grading, construction and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property.
(5)
In the case of single-family residential subdivisions approved after the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the city shall assume maintenance responsibility two years after the release of subdivision streets. A special drainage district, as authorized by state law, will be established for property in a single-family residential subdivision at the time the plat is finally recorded and will be so noted on the plat. Upon completion of developer maintenance all detention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage.
(6)
These facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived will not be accepted for city maintenance, unless individually approved and accepted by the mayor and city council and suitable access easements are provided. At the time the mayor and city council accepts a retention facility for city maintenance, a special drainage district may be established that includes all properties for which the retention facility is designed.
(7)
Pursuant to the creation of special drainage districts by the city, as authorized by state law, revenues to fund city maintenance of retention facilities may be obtained by an ad valorem tax on all properties for which the retention facilities are designed. Such ad valorem millage rates may be set annually by the board of commissioners when other ad valorem millage rates are set. No assessment will be made in a special drainage district in the calendar year in which it is established.
