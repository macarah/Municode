Sec. 119-5. - Definitions.
For the purposes of these regulations, certain words or terms used herein shall be defined as follows. The term "used for" shall include the terms "arranged for," "designed for," "intended for," and "occupied for."
Administrator. Reserved.
Buffer means any visual buffer or screening required by any pertinent section of the city zoning regulations.
Building means any structure having a roof supported by columns or walls that encloses a space and intended for the shelter, housing or enclosure of any individual, animal, process, equipment, goods or materials of any kind or nature or as further defined in the building code of the city.
Building permit applicant means the person who applies for a building permit.
Caliper means the diameter or thickness of the main stem of a young tree or sapling as measured at six inches above ground level. This measurement is used for nursery-grown trees having a diameter of four inches or less.
Canopy trees means large, preferred trees which provide a canopy over streets and other paved areas. At maturity, such a canopy tree will achieve a canopy spread of 40 or more feet in diameter. Using a radius of 20 feet for calculation purposes, the canopy cover area for one mature tree will be equal to 3.1416 feet by (20)2 feet or 1,257 square feet. Total canopy coverage for one acre of land would be equal to 43,560 divided by 1,257, or 35 large canopy trees.
City arborist. Reserved.
Clearing means the removal of vegetation of two-inch DBH or greater.
Development means the act, process or state of erecting buildings or structures, or making improvements.
Diameter, breast height (DBH) means the diameter or width of the main stem of a tree as measured 4.5 feet above the natural grade at its base. Whenever a branch, limb, defect or abnormal swelling of the trunk occurs at this height, the DBH shall be measured at the nearest point above or below 4.5 feet at which a normal diameter occurs.
Director of inspections means the director of the inspections department.
Exceptional tree means any tree determined by the mayor and city council, as provided for herein, to be of notable historic interest, high aesthetic value, or of unique character because of species, type, age, or size.
Fifty percent canopy cover means a canopy expected to be achieved over a 30-year period by the planting of large, preferred trees or the retention of existing canopied trees which result in a minimum of 50 percent cover across the city. Fifty percent canopy cover will be approximately 18 large, preferred trees per acre, quantified as 1,600 tree quality points per acre.
Greenspace means any area retained as permeable unpaved ground and dedicated to supporting vegetation.
Greenspace plan means a map and/or supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where vegetation (greenspace) is to be retained or planted in compliance with these regulations.
Landscape plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where vegetation is to be retained or provided in compliance with these regulations, the types of vegetation, and how such vegetation will be provided. The landscape plan also includes any buffer elements.
Landscape quality point means a unit of measurement which quantifies the relative value of shrubs, ground cover, and vines which are planted or retained on a given site. Landscape quality points are also given to small and medium trees which are planted on the site. A landscape quality point, like a tree quality point, quantitatively expresses the desirable qualities of the species with regard to the size, density and landscape attributions.
Plot plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where the building, driveway, utility corridors and easements are to be located and where greenspace is to be retained or planted in compliance with these regulations.

Pre-design means the period of time before a conceptual design plan is approved by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.
Preliminary plan means a map which shows the proposed design for a subdivision, as specified in the city subdivision regulations.
Quality points factor means a decimal fraction that is assigned to each tree species in the tree lists and is used as a multiplier in calculating the tree quality points for any tree retained on a site. The factor helps to translate the diameter breast height into the area of canopy cover for the tree.
Set-aside means a piece of land dedicated to open space by the developer or owner. Examples of set-asides include wetlands, parkland, recreation areas, medians of boulevards, etc.
Sketch plan means a conceptual layout for a subdivision as specified in the city subdivision regulations.
Species diversity means a planting or retention of diverse tree species on a site or within the community to prevent dominance by any single type of tree. The purpose of this diversity is to prevent the destruction of the entire urban forest in the event of disease or pestilence.
Tree easement means an easement, not less than ten feet in width and not in conflict with any other planning requirements under the zoning and subdivision regulations, for the public planting and or maintenance of canopy street trees exclusive of utility, drainage or other easements. Administrative approval is required for easements greater than ten feet in width.
Tree establishment plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be planted in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees and their corresponding tree quality points.
Tree fund means a fund set up by the city for the purpose of planting required trees. An owner, developer, and/or building permit applicant may contribute to such a fund.
Tree protection plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be retained in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees, and the corresponding tree quality points.
Tree protection zone means the area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival, and is protected within the guidelines of these regulations.
Tree quality point means a unit of measurement which quantifies the relative value of trees that are planted or retained on a given site. Tree quality points quantitatively express the desirable qualities of the species with regards to size for each tree that is retained on a site. For planted trees, tree quality points are an expression of species desirability and the expected mature size of each tree.
Vegetative practices means measures to stabilize erodible or sediment producing areas by covering the soil with plantings, such as:
(1)
Permanent seeding, sprigging, or planting producing longterm vegetative cover;
(2)
Short-term seeding, producing temporary vegetative cover; or

Porous paving may be used within outdoor display, sales and parking areas to provide root growth area for new and existing trees.
(3)
Cellular phone towers. Because of the size and location of many cellular tower sites, which makes required landscaping on the site often impractical, the administrator may approve of the following three alternatives:
a.
Planting large canopy trees within the front yard setback along the roadways if there are no conflicting utility locations. The required tree and landscape quality points may be combined together to provide tree quality points for the site.
b.
When utilities or site constraints do not allow planting within the front yard setback, plantings may be approved off-site at other locations within the immediate neighborhood. Trees may be planted either in the city right-of-way where there are no utilities or in street tree easements on private property.
c.
When there are no viable locations either on site or within the immediate vicinity, a contribution may be made to the city tree fund.
(4)
Stormwater detention areas. Where planting within a stormwater detention area will help it function more efficiently and help make the detention area more visually attractive, such plantings are permitted subject to the following conditions:
a.
Planting in or near detention basins.
1.
The centerline of the swale of a storm drainage easement shall be kept free of debris and planting, with the exception of grasses or ground cover material which stabilizes the bare soil. This area shall be maintained so that the flow of water is not impeded. Plantings of shrubbery and trees shall be kept a minimum of ten feet, or as approved by the administrator, from the centerline of the swale so as to keep the area clear for water flow.
2.
The area immediately surrounding drainage structures such as grates, inlets, weirs, etc., shall be kept free from plantings and mulch to keep debris from clogging the structures and impeding the flow of water. All trees and shrubs shall be kept a minimum of ten feet away from such structures.
3.
The centerline of stormwater detention basins (considered the area of the swale) shall be kept free of debris and planting, with the exception of grasses or ground covers which help to stabilize the soil.
4.
Trees shall be kept a minimum distance of ten feet from the centerline of the basin, or one-third the width of the basin floor, whichever is greater.
5.
Shrubbery shall be excluded from the basin floor and banks. Shrubs may be planted at the top of the basin where there is no likelihood of the rootballs lifting out of the ground when the basin is filled with water.
b.
Vegetation for drainage basin areas. Species of vegetation to be planted in or near detention basins and drainageways are to be reviewed and approved by the administrator.
(g)
Development and expansion of existing property. One thousand six hundred tree quality points per acre and 400 landscape quality points per acre shall be provided for that portion which is being developed.
