DIVISION 16. - SERVICE CHARGES

Sec. 82-110.10. - Sewer service charge.
(a)
Established. It is hereby determined to be necessary, in order to provide facilities for the protection of the public health, safety, welfare, and to comply with applicable water quality laws and regulations for the protection of the quality of the waters of the state, to fix and collect charges upon all premises or facilities served by the water pollution control facilities of the county.
(b)
Determination of amounts. There is hereby charged and assessed to each property, premises or facility served by the water pollution control facilities of the county, or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water or liquids, either directly or indirectly into the water pollution control facilities, a sewer service charge and assessment payable as hereinafter provided, and in the amount determinable as follows:
(1)
The sewer service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used by the premises or facility therein or thereon as measured by a water meter or meters there in use, or as otherwise currently established.
(2)
The sewer service charge shall consist of a charge per 1,000 gallons of water consumed, including adjustments thereto, plus the fixed costs. Rates shall be established for each customer class.
(3)
Reserved.
(4)
Any customer that discharges wastewater that is produced on-site, including without limitation, landfill leachate, shall meter all wastewater at the point of discharge to the sewer collection system, and the sewer service charge will be calculated from that metered flow.
(c)
Reserved.
(d)
Additional meters. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director that a significant portion of the water used by customers, as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the water pollution control facilities, then that portion of water shall not be used for billing of the sewer service charge. The director may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion which does not enter the system.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.11. - Industrial waste surcharges.
(a)
Established. All persons discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a monthly average concentration greater than the following:
(1)
A COD content of 500 mg/L as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in subsection (b).
(2)
A TSS content of 200 mg/L as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in subsection (b).
(3)
A TKN content of 25 mg/L as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in subsection (b).
(4)
A total phosphorous concentration of 5 mg/L as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in subsection (b).
(5)
A biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) concentration of 250 mg/L as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in subsection (b). (This parameter may be used in lieu of COD as determined by the superintendent.)
(6)
A fats, oils and grease (FOG) concentration of 100 mg/L as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with procedures prescribed in subsection (b).

(e)
Schedule of fees, surcharges, and fines: A schedule of fees, surcharges, and fines for the water and wastewater department shall be available at the county administration building. This schedule shall include but will not be limited to: Waste hauler permit fees, grease hauler permit fees, industrial user permit fees, and wastewater surcharges and fines. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this article, nothing shall prohibit the director from assessing administrative fines, or civil or criminal penalties, in addition to the surcharges established herein whenever, in the opinion of the director, such action appears necessary in order for the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or in order for the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.12. - Billing procedure.
Industrial wastes surcharges and fines provided for in this article shall be prepared and rendered to the address supplied by the director. The volume of flow used in billing the industrial waste surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated, or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the county.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.13. - Payment of bills.
Sewer service charges and surcharges provided in this article shall be payable at the county administration building or at other authorized locations, at the same time as the water bills for a lot, parcel of land, building, premise or facility are payable. Payments for water shall not be accepted unless payment of any applicable sewer service charge or surcharge is made at the same time.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.14. - Annual analysis.
(a)
Frequency of analysis. The industrial wastewater of each industrial user subject to the industrial waste surcharge, and discharging into the county sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection by the director, and a determination of character and concentration of the wastewater shall be made annually by the industrial user, or more often, as may be deemed necessary by the director. The director shall perform at least one unannounced inspection and sampling each calendar year.
(b)
Sampling and analysis procedures. Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 as amended. Composite samples shall be representative of discharge due to normal operations. To determine the characteristics of a representative sample used in the calculation of an annual surcharge, a minimum, three representative composite samples shall be made. Sample results shall be averaged using a flow-weighted average to determine the overall average concentration for use in billing the industrial surcharge. Grab samples (of slug, batch, bypass, accidental or other episodic discharges) taken in accordance with 40 CFR 136 shall be taken to measure such constituents and characteristics as may be required by applicable law or as reasonably required by the director. Analysis of parameters, including but not limited to COD, TSS, TKN, total phosphorus (as P), BOD 5 , COD, ammonia nitrogen, chloride, pH and priority pollutants (Appendix A to 40 CFR, Part 423-126, as amended) may be performed on grab samples to characterize the discharge. Analytical results from a certified laboratory, of a properly preserved grab sample, may be used to determine surcharges, fines and enforcement actions related to, but not limited to, slug discharges or batch discharges, including analytes that are typically composite sampled. The discharger may request split samples for their own independent analysis by a certified lab.
(c)
Reporting requirements. The timely submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial users as are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and related requirements, or as required in the wastewater discharge permit, including but not limited to the reports required in § 403.12 are the responsibility of the user.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
Sec. 82-110.15. - Permit fees.
The county may establish a fee for wastewater discharge permits. this fee will be collected prior to the issuance or re-issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. These fees will be used to offset the costs of implementing the county's pretreatment program. In addition, a dollar amount per 1,000 gallons of waste discharged to the county's sewer system by waste haulers (including without limitation, septic or port-a-john waste haulers) will also be assessed. This fee will be set by the county and will be used to offset the costs of treatment at the POTW.
(Ord. No. 114-B, § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2019)
