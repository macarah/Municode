d.
An applicant whom the department head or the board determines, by reason of such applicant's business experience, financial standing, trade associations, personal associations, records of arrests, or reputation in any community in which he has resided, is not likely to maintain the outlet for which he is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state, or local laws.
e.
An applicant who is not the owner of the premises for which the license is held or the holder of the lease thereon for the period covered by the license.

Once an application, the accompanying documents described above, and the required investigative and license fees are filed with Forsyth County, the Forsyth County Sheriffs Office shall conduct a criminal investigation of the application and produce a written criminal investigation report concerning all information relating to fingerprinting, criminal history, arrest data, and other matters pertaining to law enforcement. In the event the failure to obtain fingerprinting information from state and federal authorities delays completion of the written report, the sheriffs office may later supplement any fingerprinting information. If the fingerprinting information later reveals that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this chapter, this may be grounds for denying the application or revoking a license, despite an otherwise satisfactory written report. Upon production of the criminal investigation report, Forsyth County shall assemble the application forms and all accompanying documents relating to investigation and processing of the application and deliver such documents to the department head for review.
(5)
If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this chapter, or if the department head finds that the applicant fails to meet all other qualifications outlined by this chapter, then the department head shall inform the applicant, in writing, that the application has been denied, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his/her right to appeal to the board of commissioners in accordance with subsection 50-6(c) of this chapter. If an applicant desires to appeal a denial by the department head, the applicant must file a written request for an appeal hearing with the department head within ten business days of the date of the written notice informing the applicant of the denial by the department head.

Any application which the department head determines to satisfy all the qualifications outlined in this chapter, including character requirements as contained in the criminal investigation report of the Forsyth County Sheriffs Office, shall be scheduled for review and a public hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners. The public hearing shall be advertised in the county legal organ at least once no less than 15 days prior to the date of said hearing. At that meeting, the applicant and any person opposed to said application has the right to present to the board of commissioners any information that the board of commissioners determines is relevant to the licensing decision. In making its determination on whether to approve or deny the application, the board of commissioners shall look to the qualifications set forth in this chapter and consider the public interest and welfare. The board shall have the sole discretion to grant or deny the application based on the information presented. A decision by the board of commissioners shall be made within 30 days from the date of the board of commissioners' meeting, unless the decision is postponed for purposes of the board obtaining additional information deemed necessary for consideration of the application. Notice of the decision by the board of commissioners shall be mailed or emailed to the applicant. In the event the application is denied, written notification of such denial shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his right to appeal as set forth in subsection 50-6(c).
(7)
Upon approval by the board of commissioners of the application for a license, the department head shall issue a license in accordance with the approved application.
(c)
In the event the board of commissioners denies the application for a license, suspends a license, or revokes a license, the applicant for a license or the licensee whose license was suspended or revoked may appeal to the board of commissioners for reconsideration of the license denial, suspension or revocation by filing a written request for an appeal hearing with the department head within ten business days of the date of the written notice informing the applicant of the denial, suspension or revocation. Any such appeal hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in the subsection below.
(1)
Upon receipt of a timely appeal (accompanied by a fee of $250.00 made payable to Forsyth County, Georgia), the department head shall schedule a hearing before the board of commissioners or their appointee and provide written notice to the adverse party of the time, place and date of the scheduled hearing. The department head shall also state in the written notice in reasonable detail the factual basis for the denial of the application or the suspension or revocation of the license. After notice of hearing, matters scheduled for hearing may only be continued by agreement of the department head and the adverse party and/or counsel for the adverse party.
(2)
The board of commissioners or their appointee shall have the duty of conducting hearings concerning the timely filed appeal of the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license. The standard of proof on all issues in the hearing shall be a preponderance of the evidence and a determination will be made on the basis of the competent evidence presented at the hearing. At its discretion, the board of commissioners may appoint a special master to conduct said hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law and report such findings and conclusions to the board of commissioners and to the department head.
(3)
At the hearing, the department head or his or her designee shall present the facts upon which the denial, suspension, or revocation of the license were based. After presentation of the case against the adverse party, the adverse party will have an opportunity to present his/her case, to rebut the allegations made against him/her, and present whatever defenses he/she has. The adverse party shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the adverse party, and to present evidence and cross-examine opposing witnesses.
(4)
At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of commissioners shall determine whether the denial, revocation, or suspension of the license was warranted. The findings and conclusions of the board of commissioners shall be forwarded to the department head and it shall be the duty of the department head to provide written notification to the adverse party of the actions of the board of commissioners.
(5)
The decision of the board of commissioner shall be final unless appealed to the Superior Court of Forsyth County, Georgia, within 30 days of the department head providing written notification to the adverse party of the board's decision.

All licenses granted under this chapter shall expire on December 31 of each year. An investigative fee of $350.00 shall be required for renewal applications pertaining to licenses that are to be issued for odd years in order to complete a criminal history report. In instances where a new, named licensee has been designated, a criminal history report and investigative fee shall be required regardless of the year. Persons holding a license for more than any one establishment and desiring to renew the license for such establishments shall pay only one investigative fee charge. Late applications will begin being processed at the time of receipt but are not guaranteed renewal prior to January 1. If an application is submitted after January 31, a new application shall be required because renewal eligibility will not be considered past this date.

Each application for renewal will show the date of the original application and that the applicant or applicants for the renewal are familiar with applicable Georgia laws and regulations and with the rules and ordinances of the county. The applicant will furnish all information required by the renewal application and failure to furnish the information will be grounds for denying the application. A false statement made on the renewal application will void the application and shall make the applicant liable to prosecution for false swearing under the laws of the State of Georgia.
(5)
Each application for renewal of a license shall be approved or denied in accordance with the procedures prescribed in section 50-6 of this chapter, except that the public hearing for applications of renewal conducted before the board of commissioners will be held at the last regularly scheduled December meeting of the calendar year.
(e)
No license for the sale of a non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia shall be transferable, except upon the death of a licensee, at which time such license may be transferred to the administrator, executor, or lawful adult heir or heirs of such deceased person. If the legal representatives of such deceased licensee cannot meet all the requirements of this chapter when the time arrives to renew the license, it shall not be renewed. Whenever a licensee doing business as a sole proprietorship loses its license as a result of the provision of this chapter, the licensee's successor in interest, upon filing an application for a new license, may continue to operate under the terms of the prior license until such time as the new application is approved or denied by the board of commissioners; provided, however, no such continued operation shall be authorized until such time as a new application for license is made and the required fees paid to Forsyth County to be forwarded to the department head. Payment of fees shall not be required of a corporation whose predecessor in interest remains the named licensee under the new license.
(f)
Any suspension, revocation, or forfeiture of a license by the board of commissioners shall occur only after notice and opportunity for a hearing before the board of commissioners consistent with the procedures set for in subsection 50-6(c), above, and upon the following occurrences:

(4)
All licensees must, within six months after the approval of said license, open for business the outlet referred to in the application for license and begin the sale of the product or products authorized by the said license. Failure to open the outlet and begin the sales referred to within the six-month period, shall cause the board of commissioners to immediately revoke the license and no refund of any fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be made.
(5)
Any licensee who shall for a period of three consecutive months cease to operate the business and sale of the product or products authorized in the said license, shall, after said three months period, cause the board of commissioners to immediately revoke the license, and no refund of any fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be made.
(6)
A license may be immediately suspended or revoked by the board of commissioners upon learning that a licensee furnished fraudulent or untruthful information in the application for a license, or omits information required in the application for a license, or fails to pay all fees, taxes, or other charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter.
