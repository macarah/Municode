Issuance of a certificate of registration or renewal of a certificate of registration by the animal services division in the county does not warrant or guarantee that the requirements specified in this section are maintained by the owner of a classified dog on a continuous basis following the date of the issuance of the initial certificate of registration or following the date of any annual renewal of such certificate.
(g)
An animal services officer is authorized to make whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article.

Certificates of registration shall be renewed on an annual basis. At the time of the annual renewal of a certificate of registration, an animal services officer shall require evidence from the owner or make such investigation as may be necessary to verify that the classified dog is continuing to be confined in a proper enclosure and that the owner is continuing to comply with other provisions of the animal control ordinance. Failure to renew a certificate of registration within ten days of the renewal date or initial classification date shall constitute a violation of this article.
