10-1.1. - Application of regulations.
No building, structure, land, water, or open space shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, structurally altered, and no new use or change shall be made of any building, structure, land, water, or open space unless in conformity with all the regulations specified in this Code. No utility may locate, operate, or expand without the approval of the board.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006)
10-1.2. - Minimum requirements.
The regulations set forth in this Code shall, unless the specific context indicates otherwise, be considered minimum requirements and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of building, structure, or use.

10-1.3. - Every use must be on a lot.
No building or structure shall be erected or use established unless it is on a lot of record, except as otherwise specifically provided.
(a)
For the purposes of this section, if a land disturbance permit that requires an as-built is necessary to develop a property for a non-residential use, a minor plat establishing a lot of record is not required prior to the submittal of the land disturbance permit application. Notwithstanding the foregoing exception, the approval of an LDP without a minor plat shall not waive any other requirements of this Code, and the as-built for the project shall not be approved without full compliance with this Code.

10-1.5. - Reduction in performance standards prohibited.
No lot shall be reduced, divided, or changed so that the size of lot, width of lot, street frontage, size of setbacks, or any other dimensional requirement of this Code is not maintained, unless such reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is acquired for a public purpose, or unless a variance is granted pursuant to applicable provisions of this Code.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 11-11-2012)
10-1.6. - Setback reduction.
The front setback requirements of this Code may be reduced without requiring a variance in cases where one or more existing buildings located wholly or partially within 100 feet on either side of the proposed building or dwelling, on the same side of the same block and zoning district, and fronting on the same street of such block, is less than the minimum required front setback as shown on a survey provided by the applicant. In such cases, the setback on such lots may be less than the required setback, but not less than the average of the existing setbacks on the aforementioned lots, or a distance of ten feet from the closest edge of the street right-of-way line, whichever is greater.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 11-11-2012)
10-1.7. - Setbacks and buffers, government line.
Where a lot or parcel of land is zoned residential or agricultural, the side and rear setbacks and exterior buffers required by this Code shall not apply when such property line is adjacent to, and contiguous with, property owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, United States of America.
(Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 11-11-2012)
10-1.8. - Setbacks and buffers, adjacent local governments.

(b)
Enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. For purposes of this section, conversion of any sign from a static or tri-vision sign face to LED display or an electronic message board shall constitute a prohibited enlargement or alteration which increases the non-conformity of the structure unless such conversion is authorized pursuant to the electronic message board upgrade provisions of the Forsyth County Sign Ordinance (Chapter 66 of the Code of Forsyth County).

(e)
Subparagraph (c) of section 10-2.3 shall have no application if a property owner provides evidence to the director that a use was lawful at the time of commencement of the use and that the sole basis for legal nonconformity is that the owner's lot size was reduced by way of condemnation or by sale or dedication to an entity with the power of condemnation, and that the acreage so sold, dedicated or condemned reduced the lot size such that a previously legal use became a legal nonconforming use.
Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health, upon order of such official.

The property owner or successor in interest, to derive the benefit of this paragraph, shall be required to provide the department at the time of land disturbance permit application with cost to cure documentation issued by a condemning authority as well as documentation establishing the date of transfer of title of the acquired property or interests in property to the condemning authority.
