Annotation—Where the minutes show the adoption of an ordinance, and the mayor's vote was required for its legal adoption, it is presumed that the mayor, if present, voted for the ordinance. The testimony of the city clerk that he did not publish an ordinance is not conclusive evidence that the ordinance was not published. Hamilton v. North Georgia Electric Membership Corp., 201 Ga. 689, 40 S.E.2d 750 (1946).
Where an ordinance is in itself complete and properly passed, the fact that it recites in its title that it was enacted to amend a former ordinance which was void does not invalidate it. McCallum v. Bryant, 211 Ga. 98, 84 S.E.2d 39 (1954).

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 2-121. - Liability protection.
(a)
This section shall be known as the municipal liability protection ordinance and may be referred to as such in any document or pleading.
(b)
The mayor and council find as follows:
(1)
The city's elected and appointed officers, supervisors, administrators and employees have increasingly been the target of liability lawsuits for actions arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith;
(2)
The general assembly has empowered municipalities to purchase liability insurance or contracts of indemnity insuring or indemnifying the members of governing bodies and supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed officers of municipalities against personal liability for damages arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based upon negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or other statutory rights, whether state, federal or local;
(3)
The city has purchased liability insurance covering certain acts of the mayor and council, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed public officers on a continuous basis since 1982;
(4)
Liability insurance is not always available to cover all necessary areas of potential liability of the mayor and council, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed public officers of the city;
(5)
The city needs to retain the services of capable and experienced supervisors, administrators, employees and other public officers as well as to encourage capable and experienced members of the general public to seek and hold elective office of the city, and the prospect of personal liability unmet by available insurance is a deterring factor to the city's meeting such goal;
(6)
The state general assembly has provided that a municipality may adopt a policy establishing the terms and conditions under which it will pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against the mayor or any alderman, supervisor, administrator, employee or other elected or appointed official of the city whom it is authorized to defend pursuant to a written public policy;
(7)
It is in the best interest of the city and the good order and administration of the government of the city and its people that the city establish, in addition to any liability insurance or contract of indemnity and secondary thereto, only a policy under which the city will undertake to defend all or specified civil, criminal or quasicriminal actions brought or maintained against the mayor and any alderman or against any supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed city officers arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, based upon negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or statutory rights and to pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against any person whose defense the city so undertakes; and
(8)
These should be limitations on such duty to provide a legal defense and obligation to pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against the mayor or any alderman, supervisor, administrator, employee or other elected or appointed officer of the city such that the city is not defending or paying claims or judgments with respect to criminal offenses involving theft, embezzlement or other like crimes with respect to the property or money of or in which the city has an interest.
(c)
In addition to any contract to defend provided under any liability insurance or contract of indemnity insuring or indemnifying the mayor or aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed officers of the city against personal liability for damages arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith and secondary thereto only, it shall be the city's policy to provide as a part of the compensation in terms of employment of the mayor and aldermen, all supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed officers of the city a defense for all civil, criminal or quasicriminal actions brought or maintained against such mayor, aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed officials, arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based upon negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or statutory rights. However, the city shall not be authorized to furnish a defense to any person charged with a criminal offense involving theft, embezzlement or other like crime with respect to the property or money of or in which the city has an interest.
(1)
The city may expend public funds for such purposes, including, but not limited to attorney's fees, court costs, deposition costs, witness fees and compensation and all other like costs, expenses and fees.
(2)
The city shall designate in its sole discretion appropriate legal counsel to fulfill its policy of providing legal defense under subsection (c)(1) of this section. As a condition of receipt of such legal defense, the mayor, aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed officials of the city shall have the duty to cooperate with such legal counsel designated by the city in the defense of the claim or suit.
(d)
In addition to any liability insurance or contract of indemnity covering the mayor, aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed officials of the city, and secondary thereto only, the city shall pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against any person as provided in this section whose defense the city is authorized to undertake under subsection (c) of this section. As a condition to such payment of any part or all of any claim or civil judgment, such person shall be obligated to cooperate with the attorneys appointed or designated by the city to defend such person in the action. Failure of such employee to cooperate in the defense of the action shall void any obligation of the city to pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against such person.
(e)
This section is intended to set forth a written policy for the city as authorized and provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 45-9-21 and 45-9-22. Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving any immunity or privilege of any kind enjoyed by the city or other public body, department, board, commission or agency of the city or by the mayor and any alderman or by any supervisor, administrator, employee or other elected or appointed officer of the city or any public body, board, department, agency or political subdivision of the city.

It shall be the duty of the open records officer and his or her duly designated assistant open records officer(s) to accept written requests to inspect and copy public records, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70, et seq., and to produce to the requester all records responsive to a request within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request, unless the time for response is extended in accordance with law. No request shall be deemed filed until served upon the open records officer, either by hand delivery or statutory overnight delivery to the open records officer at City Hall, 300 W. Waugh Street, Dalton, Georgia, 30720; by certified United States mail, return receipt requested to the open records officer at P.O. Box 1205, Dalton, Georgia, 30722; by email to openrecords@cityofdalton-ga.gov; or by facsimile transmission to open records officer at 706-529-2491.

In the absence or unavailability of the open records officer, an assistant open records officer shall perform the duties of the open records officer. The absence or unavailability of a designated open records officer shall not delay the city's response to a properly served request.
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 2, 8-7-2012)
Sec. 2-238. - Request response.
Upon receipt of a request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to promptly ascertain the availability of all public records responsive to the request and to produce to the requester those records that can be located and produced within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request. For purposes of computing the time within which a response must be made, the open records officer shall not count the business day on which a request is received, nor any intervening Saturday, Sunday, or designated holiday on which city offices are closed for general business. Upon intake of a request, the open records officer shall stamp the request with the date and time of receipt, and initial the request. In any instance where records are unavailable within three business days of the request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to provide the requester with a written description of such records and a timeline for when the records will be available for inspection or copying and to provide the responsive records to the requester as soon thereafter as practicable. Such response shall also contain a good faith estimate of the cost to the requester for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production and copying of records. The open records officer shall confer with every officer or department head of the city, as necessary, to ascertain the existence of public records responsive to a request (including electronically-stored information), and it shall be the duty of every city officer and department head to confer with and provide records, or true and correct copies of the originals thereof, to the open records officer promptly, time being of the essence. Upon receipt of a public record responsive to a request, the open records officer shall determine, in consultation with the city attorney, if the record is exempt from disclosure by order of a court of this state or by law; if the record is exempt from disclosure, the written response by the open records officer shall set forth the specific legal authority under which withholding of inspection of the record is claimed. The open records officer shall maintain a log or other documentation of his or her due diligence to comply with a proper request.
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 2, 8-7-2012)
Sec. 2-239. - Fees.
The open records officer shall further have the duty to collect from a requester a reasonable charge for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of records, utilizing the most economical means available to identify and produce nonexcluded records. The charge for the search, retrieval, or redaction of records shall not exceed the prorated hourly salary of the lowest paid full-time employee who, in the reasonable discretion of the open records officer, has the necessary skill and training to perform the request; provided, however, no charge shall be made for the first quarter hour. In addition thereto, where certified copies of specific records are sought, the fees for certified copies prescribed by law shall apply; otherwise, a fee for the copying of records shall not exceed ten cents per page for letter or legal size documents or, in the case of other documents and electronic records, the actual cost of reproducing the document or media on which the records or media are produced. It shall be the right of the requester, at the time of inspection, to make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of records, at his or her own expense, using suitable portable devices brought to the place of inspection. Whenever any person has requested to inspect and copy public records and received a written response estimating the cost of the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records responsive to the request, and the city has actually incurred such costs but the requester fails to inspect or accept copies of the records, the open records officer shall be authorized to collect such charges in any manner authorized by law. In any instance in which the open records officer has estimated costs in excess of $25.00 for responding to a request, the open records officer may defer the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records until the requester has stated, in writing, his or her willingness to pay an amount equal to the estimate of costs. In any instance in which the estimated costs exceed $500.00, the open records officer shall insist, in writing, upon prepayment of the estimated costs prior to beginning search, retrieval, redaction, production or copying of the records. In any instance in which a requester has outstanding costs owing to the city for a previous records request, the open records officer shall insist upon prepayment of the outstanding costs and estimated costs prior to beginning search and retrieval.
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 2, 8-7-2012)
Sec. 2-240. - Litigation.
Requests by civil litigants, or their counsel of record, in any ongoing civil action or administrative proceeding shall be made in writing and shall include the style of the action or proceeding, the names and addresses of all parties and, if a party is represented by counsel, the name, address, and telephone number of the party's attorney; a copy of the request shall be served by the requester upon all parties or their counsel of record in the action or proceeding contemporaneous to filing the written request with the open records officer. The open records officer shall make duplicate set(s) of records provided in response to the request available to all parties or their counsel for the cost of copies only, unless a party or its counsel elects not to receive the records and pay the copying charge. If the city is a party to the action or proceeding, a set of responses shall be provided to counsel for the city at no charge.
