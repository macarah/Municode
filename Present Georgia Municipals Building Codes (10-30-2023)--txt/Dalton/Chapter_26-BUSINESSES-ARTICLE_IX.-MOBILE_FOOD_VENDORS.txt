ARTICLE IX. - MOBILE FOOD VENDORS

Sec. 26-321. - Definitions.
[The following words, terms, or phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning]:
City-sponsored event means a public activity or event, festival, or similar outdoor gathering conducted by the City of Dalton or any of its departments, agencies, authorities, or commissions.
Clerk means the city clerk of the City of Dalton or her designated employees or agents.
Department of health means the department of health for the county of origin of a licensee under this article.
Designated food truck area means a geographic area designated by the City of Dalton as "public property and public space" wherein permitted "mobile food vendors" may vend pursuant to this article which sites shall be valid vendor locations.
Fire department means the City of Dalton fire department under the direction of its fire chief or his designated officers, employees, or agents.
Food means a raw, cooked, or processed edible substance, ice, beverage, or ingredient used or intended for use or for sale in whole or in part for human consumption.
Health permit means an official document issued by the department of health.
Mobile food vehicle (MFV) means either a "food truck" propelled by an engine which has been designed or used for mobile food vending or a "food trailer" or "food cart" without motive power that is designated to be drawn by a motor vehicle and is specifically designed or used for food vending operations. For purposes of these definitions "food vending operation" means a place, location, site, or separate area where food intended to be served in individual portions is prepared or served for a charge or required donation. As used here, "served" means a response made to an order for one or more individual portions of food in a form that is edible without washing, cooking, or additional preparation and "prepared" means any action that affects a food other than receiving or maintaining it at the temperature at which it was received.
Mobile food vending license (MFV license) means an official written permit of the City of Dalton over signature of the city clerk authorizing operation within the corporate limits of the City of Dalton in accordance with its terms and this article. This license is not the same as a permit for food service from the department of health.
Mobile food vendor (MFV vendor) means every person, corporation, association, joint stock association, firm, partnership, or individual, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or other entity, their lessees, directors, officers, employees, receivers, trustees, appointees by any court whatsoever, or the beneficiaries, executors, administrators, or personal representatives or assignees of any deceased owner, owning, controlling, operating or managing any MFV.
Operator means the individual who manages any MFV unit whether as owner, employee, or independent contractor.
Public property and public space means for purposes of this article any property owned by the City of Dalton within street rights-of-way, including any roadways, alleys, sidewalks, and green space including parks.
Revoke means to terminate all rights or privileges under the city's MFV license for a period not to exceed 90 days after which the licensee must reapply. This action is the same as "suspend." "Permanent revocation" is where the licensee has violated this article to such an extent as to render the licensee ineligible for re-application.
Rule or rules means those promulgated under section 26-326 of this article.
