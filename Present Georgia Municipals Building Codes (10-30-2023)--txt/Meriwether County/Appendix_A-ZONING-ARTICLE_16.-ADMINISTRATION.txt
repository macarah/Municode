b.
As a result of such unusual circumstance or conditions, there is an undue hardship or practical difficulty that renders it difficult to carry out the provisions of this Code.

The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or district in which property is located, and the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the provisions of this Code. The variance approved is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.

The variance does not permit a use of land, building or structure that is not permitted by right in the land use intensity district in which the variance is requested.
(j)
Staff investigation and report. The zoning administrator shall make an investigation of all variance applications and shall prepare a report, considering applicable criteria.
