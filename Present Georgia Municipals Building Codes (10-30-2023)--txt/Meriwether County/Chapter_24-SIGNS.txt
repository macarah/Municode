Chapter 24 - SIGNS

Sec. 24-1. - Title.
This chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the Meriwether County Sign Ordinance.
(Code 1991, § 10-1; Ord. of 4-11-2007(1), § 1.0)
Sec. 24-2. - Statement of findings.
(a)
The county finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. Left unregulated, however, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the overall economic growth of the county as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards and Sign Control available at http://www.scenic.org; Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP, The Public Purpose of Rowell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper (December 7, 1999) available at http://roswellgov.com. In particular, based on the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the county finds that unregulated signs:
(1)
Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians;
(2)
Can create unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares throughout the county;
(3)
Can hamper economic growth;
(4)
Can lower property values;
(5)
Can adversely impact public investments;
(6)
Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and
(7)
Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment.
(b)
The county also finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or business. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The county finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a proprietary purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
(c)
The county finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
(Code 1991, § 10-2; Ord. of 4-11-2007(1), § 2.0)
Sec. 24-3. - Statement of purpose.
(a)
By enacting this chapter, the county intends:
(1)
To balance the rights of individuals, businesses, and government to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
To afford the business community equal and fair opportunity to advertise and promote its products and services without discrimination;
(3)
To preserve and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county;
(4)
To improve traffic and pedestrian safety;
(5)
To maintain and enhance the visual environment, and preserve the right of citizens and visitors to enjoy the county's scenic beauty;
(6)
To protect property values of nearby public and private property by minimizing possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
To avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(8)
To promote economic development;
(9)
To enable the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; and
(10)
To promote the purposes stated in this section by regulating signs based on objective standards, including, but not limited to, height and size, and without regard to the content of the sign message.
(b)
The ordinance from which this chapter is derived is adopted under the zoning authority of the county in furtherance of the more general purposes set forth in the zoning ordinance.
(c)
The ordinance from which this chapter is derived is adopted and hereafter amended pursuant to article IX, § II, ¶ IV, of the state constitution and the Georgia Planning Act of 1989.

Sec. 24-6. - General provisions.
(a)
Permit required. A permit shall be required for the erection, alteration or reconstruction of any sign unless otherwise noted and shall be issued by the director of community development in accordance with the regulations contained in this chapter.

Design, material, and maintenance. Any sign not meeting the following provisions shall be repaired or rebuilt in accordance with the specifications of this chapter:
(1)
All signs shall be designed and constructed in accordance with applicable provisions of the International Building Code and the National Electrical Code;
(2)
The area on private property around the sign on which it is erected shall be properly maintained clear of brush, trees, and other obstacles so as to make signs readily visible;

(6)
It shall be the responsibility of the sign owner to maintain and ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(c)
Maximum height of freestanding signs. Unless otherwise specifically permitted by this chapter, the maximum height of any freestanding sign shall be 30 feet in all nonresidential (NHC, I and PUD) zoning districts. In all other zoning districts, the maximum height of any freestanding sign shall be ten feet except for those signs on I-85 and that maximum height shall be 50 feet. This height shall be measured from the grade at the right-of-way boundary line or the grade of the sign site if such grade is higher than the grade at the boundary line of the street right-of-way to the uppermost part of the sign face, base or structure. If the sign is located below the grade at the boundary line of the street right-of-way, sign height shall be measured from the edge of the right-of-way to the uppermost part of the sign face, base or structure.
(d)
Maximum sign areas. Unless otherwise specifically permitted by this chapter, the maximum sign area of any sign shall be 100 square feet. Maximum sign areas shall apply to each face separately, but no freestanding sign shall have more than two faces. Where two sign faces are located in a "V" formation, the angle between the two sign faces shall not be greater than 60 degrees. Exceptions include:
(1)
Residential shall be a maximum of nine square feet;
(2)
I-85 maximum shall be 250 square feet.
(e)
Maximum sign number. In addition to any sign allowed by section 24-8 and wall signs addressed in subsection (i) of this section, the maximum number of permitted signs per lot shall be one freestanding sign. Exception: on I-85, the maximum shall be one sign per 2,000 feet.
(f)
Minimum sign setbacks. Except as otherwise specifically provided, for any freestanding signs the minimum set from the right-of-way lines shall be ten feet and ten feet from the side and rear lot lines. However, in no case will a sign be allowed to obscure vision at a street or driveway intersection, or railway crossing, as prohibited by ordinance.
(g)
Illumination. No sign shall be illuminated by lights that flash, move, change in intensity, or turn on intermittently more than once per day. To prevent glare visible from a public street or adjoining property, the beam of any light shall be directed so as not to be visible beyond the sign at which it is directed, and the light source shall not be visible from any point on an adjacent property or the public right-of-way.
(h)
Movement or animation. No sign or part of a sign shall rotate, oscillate, or otherwise move or change in appearance, whether such motion is driven by wind, mechanical, electrical, or other means.
(i)
Wall signs. In nonresidential zoning districts only, one wall sign per establishment shall be permitted unless that establishment has street frontage on more than one side.
(1)
If a business is located in a structure that is located on a lot that has no street frontage, one wall sign shall be permitted on any single facade for that business establishment in the structure, whether that facade faces the street or not. If a business establishment is located in a structure that is located on a lot that has street frontage, but the portion of the structure where the business establishment is located does not have frontage, the business establishment is entitled to one wall sign on the business establishment's facade. If a business establishment is located in a structure that is located on a lot that has more than one street frontage, one wall sign on each facade of the business establishment which has street frontage for the facade of the business establishment is permitted. A publicly-owned alley shall be considered a street.
(2)
Wall signs attached flat against the exterior surface of a building may extend not more than 12 inches from the wall. Wall signs are not allowed in residential areas.
(3)
The total area for wall signage shall not exceed two square feet for each linear foot of building frontage attributable to the particular business which the sign will identify, or 15 percent of the total area of the one building facade upon which the signage is placed or 100 square feet, whichever is less. A sign directory is a wall sign. For buildings with multiple tenants having store fronts only, the facade rented by the tenant shall be considered as wall area for a sign.
(4)
Wall signs require a permit.
(j)
Sign message. In any zoning district, any sign, display, or device allowed under this chapter may contain any lawful noncommercial or commercial message. No provision of this chapter shall be construed to allow regulation of signs based on the content of the sign message.
(Code 1991, § 10-6; Ord. of 4-11-2007(1), § 6.0)
Sec. 24-7. - Nonconforming signs.
(a)
Findings. The county finds that nonconforming signs may adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. Such signs may adversely affect the aesthetic characteristics of the county and may adversely affect public safety due to the visual impact of said signs on motorists and pedestrians.
(b)
Nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign that is permanently affixed to the ground or to a building may continue to be used, except that the nonconforming sign:

On officially designated county, state, and federal holidays, there shall be no maximum flag size or number of flags on display.
(5)
In addition to any other permitted sign under this section, individual signs of up to ten square feet in sign area, with an aggregate sign area not exceeding 25 square feet per lot. Such signs shall be a maximum height of five feet with a minimum setback of ten feet rear and side from side property lines. For front setback, the sign must be ten feet from the property line or outside the right-of-way, whichever is greater.
(6)
Window signs, however, no more than 50 percent or 35 square feet, whichever is less, of the total available glass area shall be used to display window signs. No window signs are allowed above the first floor unless the building is a multi-tenant office or commercial structure wherein tenants have primary direct access from their space to the outside. The access must include outside walkways and stairways properly designated for public use. In no case shall any window signs be installed above the level of the second floor windows.

(2)
Signs within street or highway right-of-way. No sign whatsoever, whether temporary or permanent, except traffic control signs and signals and information signs erected by an authorized public agency or department, are permitted within any street or highway right-of-way or at any location where, by reason of position, shape, wording or color, it obstructs the view of pedestrians or vehicular traffic;

A variance may be granted upon application if an individual case of unnecessary and extraordinary hardship is placed upon the applicant for a sign permit, when such variance will not be contrary to the public interest and the purposes of this chapter.
(1)
Authority to grant variances. Pursuant to the provisions set forth in article 16 of the zoning ordinance, the planning commission is authorized to receive, consider, grant, grant with conditions, or deny applications for variances.
(2)
Variance application. A request for a variance may be initiated by a property owner or his authorized agent by filing an application with the director of community development. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and position of the proposed sign in relationship to the surrounding properties as prescribed by article 16 of the zoning ordinance in Appendix A. The director of community development may require other drawings or materials essential to an understanding of the proposed sign and variance requested and its relationship to the surrounding properties.
(3)
Fee. Each application for a variance shall be accompanied by the applicable fee, which shall be established by the county.
(4)
Conditions and criteria for granting variances. The planning commission, in cases where specifically authorized, may grant a variance only after consideration and adoption of findings of fact that all of the following conditions and criteria have been met:
a.
There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area;
b.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of the sign ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties;
c.
Granting a variance request would not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges that are denied to other similar properties;
d.
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare;
e.
The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant;
f.
The variance is not a request to permit a sign that exceeds the height and size limitations contained in this chapter;
g.
The mere existence of a nonconforming sign or advertising device shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance; and
h.
The variance requested is the minimum variance, which will make possible the logical use of the land and sign.

If the permittee refuses to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign, the director of community development will have the sign removed at the expense of the permittee.
(c)
Penalties. If the violation is not eliminated within the required time period, the sign permit shall be revoked.
