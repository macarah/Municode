SECTION 10. - WATER RESOURCE DISTRICT

10-1 - Purpose.
The intent of this section is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout Berrien County and maintain the health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public.
10-2 - Establishment of water resource districts.
The established boundaries of the county's water resource districts are shown on a map designated as the "Water Resource Districts" and are included as part of the Official Land Development Districts Map, Berrien County, which are on file with the county code enforcement officer's office.
10-3 - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this section:
Generalized wetlands map is the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Berrien County, Georgia.
Hazardous waste. "Hazardous waste" means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste by the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which is in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR section 261.3.
Jurisdictional wetland is an area adhering to the definition for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination is the delineation of jurisdictional wetlands boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC Subscript 1344, as amended.
Natural vegetative buffer is a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in the Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." [These are] habitats for endangered and threatened species that may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
Pollution susceptibility is defined as the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
Pollution susceptibility map is a map of relative vulnerability to pollution, prepared by the department of natural resources using the DRASTIC methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.)
Recharge area is defined as any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
Regulated activity is any activity which will result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
River/stream bank is the ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
Significant recharge areas are those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).
Single-family dwelling is a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family.
Utility is defined as public, private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads.
Water resource districts. A water resource district is a mapped area which imposes a set of requirements and/or specific development standards or use restrictions.
Wetlands are areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
10-4 - Groundwater recharge area district.
10-4.1 Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics, thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
10-4.2 Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
10-4.3 District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection map is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)" and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition." Standards for this district shall comply with the DNR rule 391-3-16-02, Criteria for the Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas.

10-5 - Alapaha River Corridor Protection District.
10-5.1 Description of district. The limits of the Alapaha River Corridor Protection District are hereby defined to be all land inclusive of islands in areas of the Alapaha River and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. This area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetative buffer. The 100-foot buffer is measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Because stream channels move due to natural processes, such as meandering, river bank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. To address this potential, local staff will require that all applicants submit a site plan, prepared on a plat or survey, upon which the applicant or his design specialist has designated the river bank. Local planning/inspections staff will verify the plan and enforce [the plan] as a part of the local inspections process.
The Alapaha River Corridor Protection District is not intended to prescribe a specific land use, but rather, to define a range of acceptable land uses. Within the range of uses which can be located within the district, this section establishes performance standards which apply to development within the district.
10-5.2 Intent. The intent of the regulations within this river corridor protection district is to limit the use of the Alapaha River corridor in order to:
A.
Assure the section of the river in Berrien County will not become polluted and unsuitable as a source for potable water;
B.
Protect the river corridor by establishing a natural vegetative buffer area bordering the river;
C.
Preserve those qualities making the river corridor suitable as a habitat for wildlife; and
D.
Help control erosion and to absorb floodwaters;
E.
Protect the section of the river that is or may be used as a future source of drinking water.
10-5.3 Conditions and performance standards. Within the river corridor protection district, the following conditions and performance standards shall apply:

10-6 - Wetlands district.
10-6.1 Findings of fact. The wetlands in Berrien County, Georgia, are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
10-6.2 Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values.
10-6.3 Establishment of the wetlands protection district. The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Berrien County, Georgia, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The generalized wetlands map does not represent the precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Berrien County, Georgia, and shall not serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. This ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
10-6.4 Requirement for local permit. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without a permit from Berrien County, Georgia. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, a wetlands delineation shall be determined by the land development administrator and/or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the [U.S. Army] Corps [of Engineers] determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit shall not be issued until the county receives an approved Section 404 permit from the U.S. [Army] Corps of Engineers.
10-6.5 Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted within the wetlands protection district, contingent upon adherence to all federal and state laws, provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided herein:
A.
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
B.
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing in accordance with Georgia Department of Natural Resources' standards.
C.
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
D.
The cultivation of agricultural crops, subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
E.
The pasturing of livestock, subject to the Georgia Department of Agriculture's best management practices being followed.
F.
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
10-6.6 Prohibited uses. The following uses are not permitted within the wetlands protection district:
