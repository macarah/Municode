Except as provided in this section, no application for a building permit shall be approved unless there is included with the plan for such building, improvements or use, a plot plan showing the required space reserved for off-street parking and loading purposes.

Off-street parking spaces shall not be reduced below the minimum required number for the use or facility to which they are assigned.
7-3 - Drainage, construction and maintenance.
All off-street parking and loading areas shall be drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties and/or public streets and shall be constructed of materials which will assure a surface resistant to erosion. All such areas shall be at all times maintained at the expense of the owners thereof in a clean, orderly and dustfree condition.

There shall be provided adequate interior driveways to connect each parking space with a public right-of-way. Interior driveways shall be at least 24 feet wide where used with 90 degree angle parking, at least 18 feet wide where used with 60 degree angle parking, at least 12 feet wide where used with 45 degree parking and at least 12 feet wide where used with parallel parking. Where there is no parking, interior driveways shall be at least ten feet wide for one-way traffic movement and at least 20 feet wide for two-way traffic movement. All truck terminals and truck centers shall submit a parking and egress/ingress plan for review and approval by the county code enforcement officer and State of Georgia, if applicable.

7-7 - Pavement markings and signs.
Each off-street parking space shall be clearly marked, and pavement directional arrows or signs shall be provided wherever necessary. Markers, directional arrows and signs, including ADA signs, shall be properly maintained so as to ensure their maximum efficiency.
7-8 - Number of parking spaces.
In order to assure a proper and uniform development of public parking areas throughout the area of jurisdiction of this ordinance, to relieve traffic congestion on the streets and to minimize any detrimental effects on adjacent properties, off-street parking spaces shall be provided and maintained as called for in the following schedule. These requirements do not include the required ADA spaces per land use. The total number of required handicapped parking space per use shall be determined by the county code enforcement officer. For any use or class of use not specifically mentioned in this schedule, the requirements shall be the same as a similar use as mentioned herein. Parking requirements for additions to existing uses or structures shall be based upon the total development, even if the existing use is deficient. These regulations shall apply to all land development districts.
