Subdivision II. - Parliamentary Procedure

Sec. 2-91. - Main motion.
In order for the board of commissioners to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairman until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion.
(Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-01, 2-10-1997)
Sec. 2-92. - Debate.
(a)
After the main motion is recognized by the chairman, the board of commissioners shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board of commissioners. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman.
(b)
During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion (section 2-95). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated.
(c)
Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-96). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.
(Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-02, 2-10-1997)
Sec. 2-93. - Voting procedure.
Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: (i) If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chairman can call for the vote. If there are no objections, then the chairman can proceed with the vote; (ii) If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners.
(2)
Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chairman. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote.
(Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-03, 2-10-1997)
Sec. 2-94. - Ranking of motions.
(a)
Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence.
(b)
A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and does take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list:
EXPAND
LOWEST RANK:  1. Main motion.
Subsidiary Motions (Debatable)
2. Postpone indefinitely.
3. Amend.
4. Refer to committee (commit).
5. Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely).
Subsidiary Motions (Undebatable)
6. Limit debate or extend limits.
7. Vote immediately (previous question).
8. Lay on the table (postpone temporarily).
Privileged Motions (Undebatable)
9. Questions of privilege.
10. Recess.
HIGHEST RANK: 11. Adjourn.
  (Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-04, 2-10-1997)
Sec. 2-95. - Subsidiary motions.
During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board of commissioners take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, can also apply to other subsidiary motions.
(1)
Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motions indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(2)
Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, or postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion.
(3)
Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board of commissioners can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority is required for the motion to pass.
(4)
Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(5)
Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a two-thirds vote is required.
(6)
Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of two-thirds of the board of commissioners is required for the motion to pass.
(7)
Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-05, 2-10-1997)
Sec. 2-96. - Privileged motions.
Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions.
(1)
Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairman concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairman is required to make a ruling on the question.
(2)
Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(3)
Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.
(Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-06, 2-10-1997)
Sec. 2-97. - Incidental motions.
Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board of commissioners. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting.
(1)
Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a decision that is made by the chairman, that commissioner may appeal the decision. if the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chairman has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board of commissioners shall decide by majority vote if the chairman's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is highest in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table.
(2)
Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairman to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board of commissioners. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable.
(3)
Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table.
(4)
Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairman and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable.
(Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-07, 2-10-1997)
Sec. 2-98. - Supplementary main motions.
Three motions allow the board of commissioners to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified.
(1)
Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at a meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and re-vote the original motion.
(2)
Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-58. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will be formally made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided.
(3)
Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

State Law reference— Indemnification of officials, O.C.G.A. § 45-9-20 et seq.

Sec. 2-191. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
County official or employee means all employees of the county, all elected officials of the county, the constitutional officers of the county and their employees, and all persons serving by appointment on any county board, commission, or department.
Maliciously has the same meaning and definition that the courts utilize in construing that term as it appears in Ga. Const. art. I, § II, ¶ IX.
Money damages means compensatory money damages (whether actual or special), but shall not include punitive, exemplary or vindictive damages. The county shall not indemnify any portion of a judgment that consists of punitive, exemplary or vindictive damages. The term "damages" shall also mean and include costs and attorneys' fees awarded to the plaintiff under any provision of state or federal law.
Satisfying the judgment means the county has the right to pay the judgment or to settle or compromise the claim. The county may compromise the claim without the consent of the official or employee so long as the judgment entered against the official or employee is marked satisfied and fully discharged by the clerk of the court in which it is entered.
Scope and course of the employee's job means any act or omission undertaken or committed by the official or employee while performing the duties or assignments of his county employment. A defense will be provided whenever it is alleged by the plaintiff that the incident giving rise to the lawsuit occurred at a time when the official or employee was performing the duties of his employment. However, indemnification will be provided only where the judgment itself finds and provides that the official or employee was in fact performing or attempting to perform the duties of his county employment at the time of the incident. Indemnification shall not be provided if the judgment finds and provides that the official or employee was acting for purely personal reasons outside the scope and course of his employment.

Subject to the definitions of the terms and phrases used in this division, whenever a county official or employee is sued for money damages based upon an act or omission that occurred within the scope and course of the employee's job, the county will provide legal representation at no cost to the employee. If a judgment for money damages is entered against the official or employee in his individual or personal capacity, the county shall indemnify the official or employee by satisfying the judgment, but only under the following conditions:
(1)
Where the official or employee is adjudged to have negligently performed or failed to perform a ministerial act or duty within the scope and course of the employee's job; or
(2)
Where the official or employee is adjudged to have abused his discretion in the performance of an official function within the scope and course of the employee's job, but only if the judgment provides the official or employee did not act maliciously.
(Res. No. 09100102, § II, 9-10-2001)
Sec. 2-193. - Available insurance to be exhausted.
