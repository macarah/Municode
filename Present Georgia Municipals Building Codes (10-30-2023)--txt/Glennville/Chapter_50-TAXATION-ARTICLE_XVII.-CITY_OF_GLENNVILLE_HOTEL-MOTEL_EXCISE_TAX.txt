Sec. 50-613. - Collection of tax by city.
(a)
Method of collection. The city clerk shall be charged with the responsibility for collection of the tax. In collecting the tax, the city clerk shall have available the following two methods:
(1)
At any time within three years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable and at any time within three years after the delinquency of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected, the city clerk may bring an action in court of competent jurisdiction in the name of the city to collect the amount delinquent together with interest, court costs, filing fees, attorney fees and other legal fees and costs incident thereto.
(2)
The city may enforce the collection of any amount due by imposition of a lien on the buildings or structures in which the lodgings or accommodations were furnished. The lien shall be perfected by filing on the lien docket in the clerk's office of Tattnall County, and such lien may further be enforced and collected in accordance with the procedures established in O.C.G.A. ยง 48-5-358 and all other applicable statutes relating to collection of a delinquent ad valorem tax lien by a municipality. The lien shall include all interests, court costs, filing fees, attorney fees and other legal fees and costs incident thereto.
The two remedies herein are intended to be mutually exclusive and the city clerk may choose whichever method is deemed most appropriate and effective to collect the delinquency. The city clerk may further utilize both methods if necessary to collect the delinquency, provided any amount collected in excess of the amount actually due to the city for the delinquency and costs of collection shall be refunded to the person or institution from which collection was obtained.
(b)
Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any operator liable for any amount under this article sells out the operator's business or quits the business, the operator's successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the clerk showing that the city has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.
(c)
Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold a portion of the purchase price as required, the operator shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by the operator to the extent of the purchase price.
(d)
Tax credit or interest paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this article, it may be offset by the clerk. If the operator or person determines that the operator has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the clerk, the operator will have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the clerk, the excess amount paid the city may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person by whom it was paid, or the operator's administrators or executors.
