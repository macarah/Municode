ARTICLE II. - AUTHORITY; FINDINGS; POLICY
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by article 9, section 2, paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the State of Georgia. It is hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the LaGrange-Callaway Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of LaGrange-Callaway Airport; and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the LaGrange-Callaway Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared:
(1)
That the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by LaGrange-Callaway Airport;
(2)
That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented; and
(3)
That the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power.
It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of hazards to air navigation; the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation; and the marking and lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

ARTICLE VI. - AIRPORT ZONES
In order to carry out the provisions of this ordinance, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, departure surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the LaGrange-Callaway Airport. Such zones are shown on the LaGrange-Callaway Airport Zoning map consisting of one sheet dated January, 1979, and updated February 5, 2019, consisting of three sheets, which is, by this reference, made a part of this ordinance. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
(1)
Runway larger than utility visual approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the runway.
(2)
Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than three-fourths-mile non-precision instrument approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(3)
Runway larger than utility with a visible minimum as low as three-fourths-mile non-precision instrument approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(4)

The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
(5)
Transitional zones: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.
(6)
Horizontal zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
(7)
Heliport approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface which corresponds in size and shape with the designated takeoff and landing area. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 500 feet at a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet from the primary surface.

(a)
Generally. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this ordinance in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
(b)
Prohibited uses. All structures and trees are prohibited in the runway protection zone defined as the first 1,700-foot segment of the approach zone beginning at the end of the primary surface for Runway 13-31 and the first 1,000-foot segment of the approach zone beginning at the end of the primary surface for runway 3-21.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § I(Exh. 1), 2-5-2019)
ARTICLE IX. - NONCONFORMING USES
(a)
Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of February 5, 2019, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to February 5, 2019, and is diligently prosecuted. Additionally, nothing contained herein shall prohibit construction of additions or additional floors to existing buildings provided that any such buildings were in use on February 5, 2019, the additions were contemplated and designated at the time of the original construction, and that substantial additional costs were incurred at the time of the original construction to allow for those future additions or additional floors.
(b)
Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this ordinance, the owner of any existing or extended nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the LaGrange-Callaway Airport to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the LaGrange-Callaway Airport.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § I(Exh. 1), 2-5-2019)
ARTICLE X. - PERMITS
(a)
Future uses. Except as specifically provided in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone created in this ordinance unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the Troup County Building Official. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. All structures and trees within the notification zone shall seek airspace approval by the airport manager or the FAA. Structures and trees outside of this zone shall seek airspace approval if required by federal regulations. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, using the following criteria:
(1)
In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
(2)
In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
(3)
In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree, in excess of any of the height limits established by this ordinance.
(b)
Existing uses. Except as provided in section article IX(a), no permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on February 5, 2019, or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
(c)
Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Troup County Building Official determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
(d)
Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use of any property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance, may apply to the board of zoning appeals/planning commission for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances may be allowed where it is found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and any relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this ordinance may be considered by the board of zoning appeals/planning commission unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the LaGrange-Callaway Airport for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance.
(e)
Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted, may if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of zoning appeals/planning commission, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the LaGrange-Callaway Airport, at its own expense to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
( Ord. No. 2019-06 , § I(Exh. 1), 2-5-2019)
ARTICLE XI. - APPEALS
Decisions of the Troup County Building Official may be appealed to the Troup County Board of Zoning Appeals/Planning Commission. Appeals from decisions of the board of zoning appeals/planning commission shall be taken to the Superior Court of Troup County, Georgia, by writ of certiorari.
