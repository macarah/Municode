Editor's note— Section I of Ord. No. 2010-07 , adopted Dec. 15, 2009, repealed the former Art. X., §§ 10.1—10.11, and enacted a new Art. X as set out herein. The former Art. X pertained to communication tower regulations and derived from Ord. No. 2009-08 , adopted June 2, 2009. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

10.1 - Purpose.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the authority of Troup County concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. Troup County finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and environment of the county and its inhabitants. Troup County also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset and of significant benefit to the county and its residents. In order to insure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the land use policies, Troup County is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The intent of this article is to minimize impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of the visual and environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Troup County.

( Ord. No. 2010-07 , § I, 12-15-2009; Ord. No. 2011-02 , § I(Exh. A), 10-19-2010)
10.10 - Location of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.
(A)
Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following priorities, one being the highest priority and five being the lowest priority.
(1)
On existing towers or other structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure.
(2)
On properties in areas zoned for GI, Ll, CA.
(3)
On properties in areas zoned for HC, GC, LC, NHC.
(4)
On properties in areas zoned for AG.
(5)
On properties in areas zoned for USD, MHP, MFR, RR, AGR, LRR, SFMD, PUD, CRVP, LR.
(B)
If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed explanation and justification must be provided as to why a site of any higher priority designations was not selected. The applicant seeking a special use permit must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why the proposed site was chosen and the reasons why higher priority locations were deemed unfit or undesirable.
(C)
An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected or because there is an existing lease with a landowner. An application shall address co-location as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the county why co-location is commercially impracticable or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting co-location shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
(D)
Notwithstanding the above, the county may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the county finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the county and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the county may direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this article and the public interest as determined by the BOC.
(E)
If appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the application, including the technical justification for such.
(F)
Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest available priority, the county may disapprove an application for any of the following reasons:
(1)
Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements;
(2)
Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or district;
(3)
The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use designation;
(4)
The placement and location of wireless telecommunications facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the county, or employees of the service provider or other service providers;
(5)
The placement and location of a wireless telecommunications facility would result in a conflict with, compromise in or change of the nature or character of the surrounding area;
(6)
Conflicts with the provisions of this article;
(7)
Failure to submit a complete application as required under this article.
(G)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, for good cause shown, such as the ability to utilize a shorter or less intrusive facility elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service objective, the county may require the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that relocating the site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more than one site to provide substantially the same service if the relocation could result in a less intrusive facility or facilities, singly or in combination, so long as such does not prohibit or serve to prohibit the provision of service.
( Ord. No. 2010-07 , § I, 12-15-2009)
10.11 - Shared use of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities and other structures.
(A)
The county, as opposed to the construction of a new tower, requires wireless facilities to be located on existing towers or other suitable structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure, unless such is proven to be technologically impracticable. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying all existing towers and other suitable structures within one mile of the location of any proposed new tower, unless the applicant can show that some other distance is more appropriate and reasonable and demonstrate conclusively why an existing tower or other suitable structure cannot be used.
(B)
An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other suitable structure shall be required to document the intent of the existing owner to permit its use by the applicant.
(C)
Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially within the county, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
( Ord. No. 2010-07 , § I, 12-15-2009)
10.12 - Height of Telecommunications Tower(s).
(A)
All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted.
(B)
The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the technical need by the service provider for the total height of any tower, facility and/or antenna requested and the basis therefore. To enable verification of the need for the requested height, documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data used to produce the studies at the height requested and at a minimum of ten feet lower height. Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the county, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown.
(C)
The maximum permitted total height of a new tower shall be 120 feet above pre-construction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. The 120-foot maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height.
(D)
Notwithstanding the 120-foot maximum permitted height, telecommunications towers and facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as needed within the county and only within the county.
(E)
Spacing or the distance between towers shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.
( Ord. No. 2010-07 , § I, 12-15-2009)
10.13 - Visibility of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.
(A)
Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be artificially lighted or marked, except as required by the FAA.
(B)
Stealth: All new wireless telecommunications facilities, including but not limited to towers, shall utilize stealth or camouflage techniques and technology to the extent practical, unless such can be shown to be either commercially or technologically impracticable.
(C)
Dual Mode: In order to minimize the number of antenna arrays and thus the visual impact, the county may require the use of dual mode antennas to be used, including by two different carriers, unless it can be proven that such will not work technologically and that such would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service.
(D)
Tower Finish/Color: Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint of an appropriate color to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this article.
(E)
Lighting: If lighting is required, applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations. All towers requiring lighting shall be lighted to effectively eliminate the ground scatter effect of the lighting and to prevent the light from being seen from the ground.
(F)
Antenna Profile: All new or replacement antennas, except omnidirectional whip antennas, shall be attached to create the smallest profile reasonably possible under the facts and circumstances, unless it can be proven that to do so would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the service.
(G)
Placement on Building—Facie: If attached to a building, all antennas shall be mounted on the face of the building and camouflaged to match the color and, if possible, texture of the building or in a manner so as to make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given the facts and circumstances involved.
(H)
Lighting—Preventing Ground Scatter Effect: For any wireless facility for which lighting is required under the FAA's regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air, but that prevents the ground scatter effect so that it not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least 12 degrees vertical for a distance of at least one mile in a level terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict with FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light can be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA.
(I)
In the event a lighted tower is modified, at the time of the modification the county may require that the tower be retrofitted with the technology set forth in the preceding subsection (F).
( Ord. No. 2010-07 , § I, 12-15-2009)
10.14 - Security of Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.
All wireless telecommunications facilities and antennas shall be located, fenced or otherwise secured in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. Specifically:
(A)
All antennas, towers and other supporting structures, including guy anchor points and wires, shall be made inaccessible to individuals and constructed or shielded in such a manner that they cannot be climbed or collided with; and
(B)
Transmitters and telecommunications control points shall be installed in such a manner that they are readily accessible only to persons authorized to operate or service them.
10.15 - Signage.
Wireless telecommunications facilities shall contain a sign no larger than four square feet in order to provide adequate notification to persons in the immediate area of the presence of RF radiation or to control exposure to RF radiation within a given area. A sign of the same size installed to contain the name(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s) as well as emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment shelter or cabinet of the applicant and be visible from the access point of the site and must identify the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. On tower sites, an FCC registration site, as applicable, is also to be present. The signs shall not be lighted, unless applicable law, rule or regulation requires lighting. No other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted.
( Ord. No. 2010-07 , § I, 12-15-2009)
10.16 - Lot Size and Setbacks.
(A)
All proposed towers and any other proposed wireless telecommunications facility attachment structures shall be set back from abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines by the greater of the following distances: A distance equal to the height of the proposed tower or wireless telecommunications facility structure plus ten percent of the height of the tower or structure, otherwise known as the "fall zone," or the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater. Any accessory structure shall be located to comply with the applicable minimum setback requirements for the property on which it is situated. The fall zone or setback shall be measured from the nearest portion of the right-of-way of any public road or thoroughfare and any occupied building or domicile. Further, the nearest portion of any access road to a wireless facility shall be no less than 15 feet from the nearest property line.
(B)
There shall be no development of habitable buildings within the Fall Zone or setback area set forth in the preceding subsection (A).
( Ord. No. 2010-07 , § I, 12-15-2009)
10.17 - Retention of Expert Assistance and Reimbursement by Applicant.
(A)
The county may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist the county in reviewing and evaluating the application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted, and any site inspections. To the extent this article requires the applicant to provide documentation prepared by a trained certified professional licensed to practice in Georgia (professional engineer, architect, radio frequency engineer), the review of such documentation shall be carried out by a similarly qualified professional.
(B)
An applicant shall deposit with the county funds sufficient to reimburse the county for all reasonable costs of:
(1)
Consulting and expert evaluation and consultation with the county or the applicant in connection with the submission and/or review of any application;
(2)
Any lease negotiations, the pre-approval evaluation, and including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted.
The initial deposit shall be $5,000.00 in the case of a new facility application governed by section 10.8 and $2,500.00 in the case of a co-location or equipment modification application as governed by section 10.9.
The placement of the initial deposit with the county shall precede the pre-application meeting or any work being done as regards processing an application. The county will maintain a separate escrow account for all such funds. The county's consultants/experts shall invoice the county for its services in reviewing the application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. The initial deposit shall not be increased without action by the application review committee finding that the initial application request has been modified, that the scope of the review is unique, or the applicant has failed to cooperate with the review causing additional staff/consultant time and effort to complete the evaluation of the application. However, if at any time during the process this escrow account has a balance less than $1,000.00, and the application review committee finds that the increase is warranted, the applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the county, replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least $5,000.00 in the case of a new facility application governed by section 10.8 and $2,500.00 in the case of a co-location or equipment modification application governed by section 10.9. The applicant may appeal the decision of the application review committee to require the replenishment of an escrow account to the board of commissioners by providing notice to the zoning administrator within five days of notification of the decision of the application review committee and the decision of the board of commissioners shall be final. Such additional escrow funds shall be deposited with the county before any further action or consideration is taken on the application. In the event that the amount held in escrow is more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the conclusion of the project, the remaining balance shall be promptly refunded to the applicant upon written request.
