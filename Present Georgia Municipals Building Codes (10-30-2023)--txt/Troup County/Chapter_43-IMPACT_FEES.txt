a.
The Administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee.
b.
In making such determination, the Administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule.

For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property.
(4)
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid.
(5)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.
(c)

At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as attachment A.

(d)
Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as attachment A or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable.

Sec. 43-46. - Exemptions.
(a)
Exemption policy. Troup County recognizes that certain office, retail trade and industrial development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the county's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. In addition, the county recognizes that certain types of residential development provide benefit to the county beyond tax digest value.
(1)
To encourage such development projects, the board of commissioners may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Troup County, or the extent to which an affordable housing project provides benefit to the community, in accordance with adopted exemption criteria. Such criteria shall be adopted by the board of commissioners prior to the consideration of any application for reduction or exemption from any impact fee.
(2)
It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.
(b)
Process for exemption approval. An application for exemption shall be considered under the following procedures:
(1)
Application for exemption approval must be made by the building permit applicant to the administrator. A building permit may be issued upon approval of an exemption, or may be issued without payment of applicable impact fees following receipt of a complete exemption application and pending its approval, but a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until a decision regarding the exemption has been made, or until such time that the application for exemption is otherwise withdrawn by the applicant and payment of impact fees have been paid.
(2)
Documentation must be provided to the administrator that demonstrates the applicant's eligibility for an exemption. This documentation shall address, but need not be limited to, all applicable exemption criteria adopted by the county. This documentation constitutes the application for exemption.
(3)
The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether an application for exemption addresses the exemption criteria adopted by the county and is complete. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article.
(4)
The administrator or the board of commissioners shall determine the eligibility for and extent of exemption, in accordance with the standards and procedures contained in the exemption criteria adopted by the board of commissioners. If action by the board of commissioners is required, the application for exemption shall be considered at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners that falls at least two weeks after a complete application for exemption has been received by the administrator.
