Sec. 18-3. - County comprehensive address assignment and display guide.
(a)
[General outline.] Building and location address numbers are to be assigned by Troup County Mapping and displayed by occupants and property owners as set forth herein. This section contains the general outline for the regulation of address number assignment and display. Procedures and specifications shall be provided in the county comprehensive address numbering and display guide to be available along with all applications and relevant fees in the county planning and zoning office.
(b)
General address assignment regulations. The following are minimum guidelines for assignment of addresses. Specific policies and procedures shall be included in the Comprehensive Address Numbering and Display Guide available in the offices of planning and zoning.
(1)
The county mapper shall be responsible for the approval and assignment of all addresses.
(2)
Addresses for locations on roadways in common with neighboring jurisdictions should be coordinated to provide a logical and seamless address sequence along all roadways and to ensure no duplication of addresses in the county regardless of jurisdiction.
(3)
The county mapper assigns new addresses that will be consistent with both the existing adjacent addresses and the county-wide numbering grid.
(4)
Once addresses are assigned and all required documents have been submitted and approved by the county mapper, an addressing notice is prepared that is distributed to various departments and agencies (assessor's office and county communications/911) as well as many outside service providers (post office, utilities, etc.).
(5)
Addresses shall be assigned in arabic numerals and english alphabet.
(6)
All addresses are assigned one whole number for every ten feet; no fractional addresses are allowed (i.e., ½, etc.). Only zero lot line and single-family attached style developments, such as townhomes shall allow sequential numbering.
(7)
Generally, addresses are assigned left to right, and with odd numbers on the left side of thoroughfares and even numbers on the right side of thoroughfares.
(8)
Addresses are assigned only for developed property. For major subdivisions, addresses are assigned after the approval of the preliminary development plan and after an application for address assignment is submitted. All other addresses are assigned following the submission of an address assignment application with an approved building permit.
a.
Applications shall be submitted to the county mapper in accordance with the policy guide, forms and fees created to administer this section.
b.
Applications and addressing schemes submitted for approval to the county mapper by surveyor, engineers or other registered design professionals shall be submitted in paper formats to be legible. The county mapper shall receive all major subdivision plats electronically.
(9)
No single parcel shall have more than one primary address. Where multiple structures exist on a single parcel of land, "root" building numbers shall be used along with suite or unit numbers where applicable.
(c)
General address display regulations. The following are general guidelines for display of addresses. Specific policies and procedures shall be included in the Comprehensive Address Numbering and Display Guide (guide) available in planning and zoning.
(1)
Only addresses assigned by the county mapper shall be displayed.
(2)
Addresses shall be displayed as assigned in arabic numerals.
(3)
Addresses should be contrasting in color to the background. Reflective lettering is encouraged for residential addresses, and may be required for certain other address types.
(4)
Residential addresses should be displayed at the roadside adjacent to the driveway on, in order of priority:
a.
Both sides of the structure's mailbox if adjacent to the driveway,
b.
On a two-sided sign dedicated to the display of the address.
(5)
If no road frontage or driveway from public right of way, then the address shall be placed within one foot of the access right-of-way or easement at the public road.
(6)
Residential address numbers will be a minimum of four inches on all federal, state and local roads and highways and a minimum of three feet on all subdivision roads. Minimum heights shall be included in the guide.
(7)
Nonresidential structures shall use road side and structure display as appropriate determined by development type. Nonresidential address sizes shall be determined by various factors to include location, use scale and visibility, but set forth in the guide.
(8)
Additional standards may apply for rear-loaded, multi-family, shopping center, campus and other nontraditional or intensive development configurations.
(9)
The chief building inspector shall enforce the address display guidelines of this section. For new construction or additions, the address display shall be approved prior to the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy (CO).
(d)
Road naming and signing. Road names are assigned and accepted as well as road signing in accordance with the subdivision regulation of the county. Road naming and signing policies, guidelines, and procedures shall be included for informational purposes in the guide and expanded where necessary.
Generally, the policies shall include:
(1)
Street/road types and abbreviations should be consistent with the U.S. Post Office recognized abbreviations.
(2)
The county mapper is solely authorized to include compass directional points (North, South, East, West, Northwest, etc.) in road names. Compass directional point words may be included in road and subdivision names when in conjunct with another word to create a single word (i.e., "Northpointe," "Southwood").
(3)
Road names may include english characters only.
(4)
Initials may not be included in road names, except for memorial purposes and as specifically accepted by the county board of commissioners.
(5)
Memorial or honoraria road names may be created by the board of commissioners. A memorial or honoraria name does not change the official road name or address of any property along that stretch of road or highway.
(6)
Road names may be reserved as part of a preliminary plat submission and renewed annually for up to a three-year period. Longer reservation periods may be granted for planned unit developments [and] other large scale developments. Large scale developments are typically identified as those requiring a development of regional impact study. The board of commissioners may identify and reserve road names indefinitely.
(7)
Official names of existing roads may be changed by the board of commissioners upon the report and recommendation of the county mapper and the county 911 director. Official names of existing roads may be changed only when the board of commissioners determines in its discretion that the change is necessary as the result of:
a.
Duplications and/or confusing similarities between road names that may interfere with the accurate dispatch of emergency vehicles or postal delivery;
b.
Road construction that has resulted in the extension of a road to another road so that both roads are joined in such a manner that both roads may be considered one road; or
c.
One road having two commonly used names or where portions of what appears to be the same road has two or more names.
(e)
Amendments. Guidelines shall provide for procedures to amend address assignments and road names by the county mapper, board of commissioners or property owners.
(f)
Compliance and enforcement.
(1)
The chief building official shall be the enforcement officer charged with enforcing the portions of this regulation relating to the display of addresses.
(2)
Numbering or display discrepancies noted by emergency personnel shall be reported to the E-911 director who will coordinate with the county mapper or chief building official as appropriate.
(3)
Citizen and visitor reports of apparent inappropriately displayed addresses, numbering discrepancies, or errors in third-party maps may be reported to the building inspections office for investigation and corrective action, if any.
(4)
Preexisting structures. At the determination of necessity, the chief building official may compel a property owner of a structure in existence prior to the adoption of this section to properly display the address signage for a property. Upon the failure of the property owner to comply, the chief building official may take the following action:
a.
Fine the property owner $25.00 for each notification of failure to properly display signage, not to exceed one notification per month for a maximum of six notifications.
b.
Upon failure of order to place proper signage, the chief building official may install signage, subsequently bill the property owner for the cost of production and installation of the sign plus a processing fee not to exceed $10.00. An additional $10.00 late fee may be charged for every 30 days the unpaid balance is not satisfied. If, after 90 days the complete bill is unpaid, the county may place a lien on the property for the entire amount of the outstanding balance of the bill to include all fines, fees and charges.
(5)
Appeals for address number location or relocation may be addressed to the chief building official who will coordinate with E-911 and emergency response officials for consideration, but whose determination will be final.
(g)
Variances. The county board of commissioners may authorize a variance from these guidelines when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance. In granting any variance, the county board of commissioners shall make the findings required below. No variance shall be granted unless the board finds:
(1)
That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property that the strict application of the provisions of these guidelines would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his land;
(2)
That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the petitioner;
(3)
That the circumstances giving rise to the need for the variance are peculiar to the parcel and are not generally characteristic of other parcels in the jurisdiction of these guidelines; and
(4)
That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which the property is located.
