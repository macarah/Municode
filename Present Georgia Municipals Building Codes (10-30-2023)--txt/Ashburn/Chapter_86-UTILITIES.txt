In the absence of an executed service agreement or other written agreement, such a verbal agreement shall be conclusively presumed to exist if gas supplied by the city is used by the customer or on the customer's premises.
Sec. 86-52. - Interruptions of service; action to maintain system integrity; special conditions.
(a)
Interruptions. The city shall make reasonable efforts to avoid interruptions of service.

Sec. 86-53. - Pressure.
The City will generally supply natural gas at a pressure of approximately 0.25 pounds per square inch gauge ("psig"). The city and the customer, however, may mutually agree upon a higher pressure at which gas shall be delivered. In no event shall the city be required to furnish gas to the customer at a pressure exceeding two psig for residential service, or five psig for all other classes of service, except to the extent that the city has agreed to do so by written agreement.
Sec. 86-54. - Relocation of city meters and equipment.
The city may change the location of facilities and rights-of-way upon customer's request, but the customer must bear the expense of the change; provided, however, no change will be made where it will interfere with or jeopardize city's service, either to the customer requesting the change or to any other customer(s). All privileges of the city incident to the original location shall apply to the new location. When a meter is relocated at the city's option, all expense in connection with such change shall be borne by the city. If the relocation is made at the customer's request, all expense will be borne by the customer.
Sec. 86-55. - Possession of gas.
The customer agrees that the city is responsible only for the gas service to the delivery point to the customer, and the city shall not be liable to customer or any of customer's agents, servants, or employees, or to any person whomever, for any loss, damage, of injury to any person or property resulting from the said gas or its use after it leaves said delivery point. Customer agrees that customer shall assume all such risks downstream of the point of delivery, except when caused by the exclusive negligence or willful acts of the employees of the city.
Furthermore, the city shall not be responsible for the transmission, use, or contrzol of gas beyond the delivery point. The city shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or injury to person or property whatsoever, accruing or resulting in any manner, from the receipt, use, or discontinuance of the use of the gas beyond the delivery point, defective customer equipment, or any cause not resulting from the direct, exclusive negligence or willful acts of the city.
Sec. 86-56. - Reports of leaks.
Customer shall give immediate notice to the city when any leakage of gas is discovered. Customer agrees not to use any light of any character, or other igniting medium, in the proximity of escaping gas, or to do, or suffer to be done, any act which would ignite such gas, and to shut off the flow of gas immediately. The city shall not be liable for any leakage of gas, or any damage or loss arising out of, or caused by, any leakage of gas, except when due to the exclusive negligence or willful acts of the employees of the city.
Sec. 86-57. - Extension of service.
(a)
The city will extend mains in streets that are at an established final grade for distances up to 100 feet without charge to the customer. If a main extension exceeds 100 feet, the city will perform a feasibility test and may require a CIAC to reimburse the city for the cost of any main extension in excess of 100 feet and any other excess facilities necessary to extend service in the event the anticipated revenue does not produce a reasonable return on the total cost of such excess facilities.
(b)
The city will install up to 100 feet of gas service line (measured from the premises's property line to the meter on the customer's premises) at no charge. For installations requiring more than 100 feet of gas service line, the city may require the customer to pay a CIAC.
(c)
Notwithstanding the above, if facilities in addition to a simple main extension and service line are required, the city will perform a feasibility test to determine whether or not these facilities will require the customer to pay a CIAC.
(d)
A CIAC may be required for facilities located at a point other than that selected by the city or deviating from the route selected by the city.
At any time a feasibility test is required, the city shall also calculate the estimated cost of (1) the main in excess of the 100 feet of main for which no CIAC is required and (2) the service line in excess of the 100 feet of service line for which no CIAC is required for new customers occupying existing structures. (For proposed new subdivisions, the allowances for extensions of mains and service lines should be considered only for existing structures that plan to use gas at the time the main is to be extended.) Any CIAC shall be the lesser of (1) the CIAC calculated in the feasibility test or (2) the full cost of extending the lines beyond the initial allowances of 100 feet of main and service line. The aforementioned feasibility test shall include all costs directly associated with the service extension. The city may waive this requirement at its discretion on a case by case basis.
[(e)]
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (g) of this section, the city will perform a feasibility test to determine whether or not these additional facilities will require the customer to pay a CIAC.
[(f)]
A CIAC may be required for facilities located at a point other than that selected by the city or deviating from the route selected by the city.
[(g)]
At any time a feasibility test is required, the city shall also calculate the estimated cost of (1) the main in excess of the 100 feet of main for which no CIAC is required and (2) the service line in excess of the 100 feet of service line for which no CIAC is required for new customers occupying existing structures. (For proposed new subdivision, the allowances for extensions of mains and service lines should be considered only for existing structures that plan to use gas at the time the main is to be extended.) Any CIAC shall be the lesser of (1) the CIAC calculated in the feasibility test or (2) the full cost of extending the lines beyond the initial allowances of 100 feet of main and service line. The aforementioned feasibility test shall include all costs directly associated with the service extension. The city may waive this requirement at its discretion on a case by case basis.
[(h)]
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (g) of this section, the city will perform a feasibility test to determine whether a CIAC is required for all extensions of service when the customer's request for service does not include the use of gas for either central space heating or water heating.
Sec. 86-58. - Farm tap service.
(a)
Whenever an applicant requests service which can only be supplied from a high pressure (above 60 pounds per square inch gauge) main, the city, subject to the results of a feasibility test, may tap the main, install regulating equipment, and extend its facilities to the delivery point on the customer's premises. The customer will provide the city with all necessary rights-of-way on its premises at no expense to the city. Whether a CIAC is required of the customer prior to the installation of such facilities will be determined by the results of the feasibility test.
(b)
For a farm tap customer, a feasibility test shall be performed which includes all costs less an allowance for the cost of (i) the actual feet of main required to serve the customer, not to exceed 100 feet, (ii) the actual feet of service required to serve the customer, not to exceed 100 feet, and (iii) the actual number of meter set(s).
(c)
Charges for service will be billed on the applicable city rate schedule. All other terms and conditions of the applicable city rate schedule(s) apply to customers using farm tap service.
(d)
Any customer receiving service as the result of the installation of a farm tap customer shall furnish to the city, at all times and at no cost to the city, a satisfactory and lawful right-of-way through its premises for the city's equipment necessary or incidental to the furnishing of service and shall execute a written right-of-way agreement. The customer may make full use and enjoyment of the lands and premises included within the right-of-way granted by this paragraph in any manner not inconsistent with the use and purposes of said land and premises by the city; provided, however, that the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, shall not construct nor permit to be constructed any house, structure, or obstruction; nor impound nor permit to be impounded any water on or over the right-of-way; and the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, further agree that the customer and its heirs, successors, and assigns will not change the grade over the pipeline or pipelines in any manner which will reduce the depth of said pipeline or pipelines.
Sec. 86-59. - Customer's equipment.
(a)
An applicant or customer shall give the city notice prior to installing any customer equipment (including any equipment which may increase the customer's load) on the premises to enable the city to ascertain the feasibility of providing service to such equipment. The city shall provide information concerning the availability of service (including whether the city can service the increased load), delivery pressure, meter location, and other information which may be pertinent to the installation.
(b)
The customer's equipment must be installed and maintained in accordance with approved installation standards and the requirements of applicable local, state, and federal agencies. All customer equipment shall be maintained by and be the sole responsibility of the customer and/or owner of the premises.
(c)
If the customer's equipment might create a vacuum, back pressure, or any other condition which in the city's sole opinion could cause operating difficulties on the city's system, a device meeting city's specifications must be installed and maintained by the customer, at its sole expense, to protect fully and completely the city's system.
Sec. 86-60. - Requests to increase load.
Residential customers receiving service will be permitted to increase their residential gas loads at the same premises without the consent of the city. All other customers shall make a request to the city before increasing their gas loads and before changing the purpose for which they use gas. The request will be in writing and will specify, at a minimum, the name of the customer, type of service needed, estimated monthly gas consumption, and the date needed. If, in the city's sole opinion, it has the capability to provide the additional or changed gas service without interfering with its ability to provide service to its other customers, the city will permit the customer to increase customer's load or to change the purpose for which the customer uses gas. A CIAC may be required depending on the nature of the request.
Sec. 86-61. - Excavation near the city's facilities.
The customer shall inform the city of any excavation activities near the city's equipment located on the customer's premises by calling the city manager at least 48 hours in advance of such activities. The customer will give a similar notice to the city prior to any additions or changes in customer's premises which will extend over, under, or near the city's equipment. Any damages incurred or losses of gas resulting from any such activity shall be billed to the customer.
Sec. 86-62. - Prohibition against resale of gas.
The customer shall not directly or indirectly sell, resell, assign, or otherwise transfer gas to any person unless such transfer is pursuant to a contract or franchise acceptable to the city.
Sec. 86-63. - Unavoidable cessation of consumption.
In the event the customer's premises are destroyed or the operation of its facilities is shut down due to causes beyond the customer's control resulting in a complete cessation of the use of service, then upon written notice to the city advising that the customer has ceased operations for the reasons set forth above, which reasons for the complete cessation of the use of service shall be specifically described, and intends to resume service as soon as possible, any customer charge, minimum charge, or guarantee for which the customer may be held liable may be waived, in the sole discretion of the city, during the period of such cessation. To be effective, such notice must be received by the city within ten days of the occurrence of the cessation.
