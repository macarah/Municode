ARTICLE I. - PROPERTY TAXATION

Sec. 78-1. - Administration.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this article, the city clerk (ex-officio treasurer, tax receiver, tax collector) shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection, and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures hereinafter set forth. To the extent this article fails to provide a designated procedure, said officer shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law.
(b)
In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes.
(c)
Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the mayor and city council shall, by resolution, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed. Prior to adoption of said millage rate, the governing body shall publish the notice of any proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied.
(d)
The city clerk shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. Mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent), and its taxable value (40 percent of fair market value), and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the mayor and city council.
Sec. 78-2. - Due date; payment; interest on past due taxes.
(a)
All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment.
(b)
All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance of the mayor and council, no partial payments shall be accepted.
(c)
Taxes and special assessments shall bear annual interest at the rate of three percent above the federal prime rate. In 2016, this rate shall be .542 percent assessed each month from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The city clerk may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he/she reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his/her department.
(Ord. No. 16-06, § 1, 8-4-2016)
Sec. 78-3. - Penalties.
(a)
All penalties imposed by this article are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed by this article.
(b)
In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within 120 days of the due date, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein. Where the taxpayer continues to fail to pay a tax or assessment beyond the initial 120 days, this penalty shall increase by five percent every 120 days, however the maximum penalty that may ever be imposed is 20 percent of the principle amount due.
(c)
The mayor and council may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this ordinance to the extent said body finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article.
(Ord. No. 16-06, § 2, 8-4-2016)
Sec. 78-4. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments.
(a)
As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city clerk shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days, an execution shall be issued.
(b)
The city clerk shall issue executions for the non-payment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) immediately above. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi.fa. (taxpayer), the year(s) for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state."
(c)
The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place.
(d)
All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this article for past due taxes and assessments.
(e)
The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi.fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi.fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article.
Sec. 78-5. - Levy of executions; sale of property.
(a)
The chief of police of the city is hereby designated as marshal of the city and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi.fa.
(b)
In all cases of levying on real property, within five days of such levy written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi.fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi.fa. therein.
(c)
Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner(s) of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk.
(d)
When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi.fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
(e)
The marshal shall publish weekly for four consecutive weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the name(s) of the owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed.
(f)
Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the City Hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or eastern daylight savings time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Ashburn, shall make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied.
(g)
The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi.fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired.
(h)
Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.
Sec. 78-6. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired.
(a)
If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager or his/her designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold.
(b)
Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 78-9 herein.
(c)
The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 78-9 herein.
Sec. 78-7. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement.
(a)
The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. The marshal shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess.
(b)
In any event, within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection.
Sec. 78-8. - Garnishment by city; reduction of executions to judgment.
(a)
Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi.fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi.fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi.fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued.
(b)
When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi.fa. may have or may come into ownership or assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi.fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi.fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
Sec. 78-9. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi.fa.; vesting of title in grantee.
(a)
Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi.fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-45, which Code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of this article.
(b)
Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in paragraph (a) immediately above, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi.fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi.fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated.
Sec. 78-10. - Costs.
(a)
For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the Clerk of Superior Court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi.fa.
(b)
Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi.fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and costs heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00.
(c)
In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual costs for advertising the same, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00, and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00.
(d)
The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price.
Sec. 78-11. - Ad valorem tax.
(a)
The city council shall assess, levy, and collect an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property within the corporate limits of the city that is subject to such taxation by the state and county.
(b)
The city council shall use this revenue to defray the costs of operating the city government, of providing governmental services, for the repayment of principal and interest on general obligations, and for any other public purpose as determined by the city council in its discretion.
(c)
The millage rate for the city property tax shall be 10.999. The city property tax must be paid by December 20, 2019. If the taxpayer fails to pay within 120 days, then the city shall be authorized to collect the penalties and interest set forth in section 78-3 of the Ashburn Code of Ordinances.
(d)
The city property tax shall be paid in one lump sum by the due date specified above; however, the city council authorizes the voluntary payment of city property taxes prior to the time when due.

This article shall be known as the "Ashburn Blighted Property Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 2022-6, § 2, 10-6-2022)
Sec. 78-165. - Purpose.
The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this board of commissioners, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at O.C.G.A. title 36, chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by article IX, section II, paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

The public officer may cause a survey of existing housing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or finalized within the previous five years, to locate or identify any parcels which may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel of property meets the criteria set out in this article for designation as being maintained in a blighted condition.

Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, as provided in section 78-168, Identification of Blighted Property, of this article, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of half to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years.
