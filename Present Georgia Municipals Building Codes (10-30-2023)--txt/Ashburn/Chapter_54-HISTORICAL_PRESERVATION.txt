Application for designation. Designations may be proposed by the HPC, the mayor and city council, a historical society, a neighborhood association, a group of property owners for the designation of a district as historic, or a property owner for the designation of his or her property as historic.
(2)
Recommendation by HPC. The designation of a historic district or historic property may only be considered by the mayor and city council upon the recommendation of the HPC. Upon receipt of the HPC's recommendation and a copy of the historic resource report and analysis of the proposed historic district or historic property under the criteria established in subsection (3) herein, the HPC and the mayor and city council shall schedule a public hearing to consider the proposed designation. The city clerk's office shall provide notice of a public hearing in the same manner as set forth in subsection (3) herein.

A notice sent via United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the Turner County Tax Roll and a notice sent via United States mail to the address of the property to the attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this chapter.

If approved or approved with modifications the mayor and city council may adopt a designation ordinance for the proposed historic district or historic property.

Required components of a designation ordinance. An ordinance designating a historic district or historic property shall:
a.
Describe the boundaries of a proposed historic district;

(6)
Modification or withdrawal of proposed designations. Any recommendation to modify or withdraw the proposed ordinance for designation shall be made by the HPC within 15 days following the public hearing and shall be in the form of a resolution to the mayor and city council.

A notice sent via United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the Turner County Tax Roll and a notice sent via United States mail to the address of the property to the attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this chapter.
(9)
Notification of other agencies regarding this designation. The HPC shall notify all necessary agencies within the city and Turner County of the ordinance for designation, including the local historical organization(s).
(10)
Effect of designation. After designation by the mayor and city council, a historic district or historic property shall be subject to the procedures and regulations contained in this chapter. Unless otherwise specified, the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as amended from time to time, shall apply as the design guidelines for the historic district or historic property. These procedures, regulations, and design guidelines shall be in addition to the provisions of other articles of this chapter, and other regulations of the city that shall remain in full force and effect.

Sec. 54-82. - Application requirements.
All applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made as required by the HPC and shall at a minimum contain the following information:
(1)
Elevation drawings and material samples. Every application or review involving the construction of a new building or structure and alterations and/or additions to existing structures in any historic district or to a historic property shall be accompanied by exterior elevation drawings drawn to a specific scale and signed by an architect, engineer or other appropriate professional and submitted in sufficient number of copies as required by the HPC.

Photographs. Photographs of all sides of the affected existing building(s) or structure(s) visible from the street shall accompany all applications, as well as photographs of adjoining properties. Photographs of all sides of the building visible from the street shall accompany applications for the demolition of structures under consideration for demolition, as well as photographs showing contiguous properties.

(Ord. No. 07-08, § V(B), 6-7-2007)
Sec. 54-83. - Review criteria.
When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects, including the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, and the city design guidelines for the local historic district, attached hereto as attachment B shall be used as guidelines. In addition, the HPC shall consider:
(1)
The effect of the proposed work on the property upon which such work is to be done;
(2)
The relationship between such work and other buildings, structures, or objects on the landmark site or other property in the historic district. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the HPC shall consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style, design arrangement, texture, and materials;

The HPC shall not have review authority over alterations to the interiors of a building or structure, but it shall study such plans as they relate to the exterior. The HPC shall not have review authority over paint colors used on the exterior of designated buildings;

A rehabilitation should relate properly to the original components of a building and the surrounding neighborhood. It is important to maintain existing old-growth trees in a rehabilitation within a historic district or historic property;
(5)
Design standards for new construction and additions focus attention on those special visual and spatial qualities that a historic district and historic property is established to protect. Since architectural styles and details vary within a district, the standards emphasize the relationship among buildings in the immediate setting.
