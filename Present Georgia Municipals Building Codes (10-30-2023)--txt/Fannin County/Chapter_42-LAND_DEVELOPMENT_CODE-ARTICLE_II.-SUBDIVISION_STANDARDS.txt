ARTICLE II. - SUBDIVISION STANDARDS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 42-29. - Subdivision defined.
Subdivision is defined in section 42-2 as the division of a single parcel of land into two or more parcels. All future subdivisions of land in Fannin County shall comply with the applicable provisions of this article. The subdivision approval process and submission requirements vary with the magnitude of the subdivision. All minor subdivisions shall be submitted to and approved by the Fannin County development officer as provided for in section 42-30. All major subdivisions of land shall be submitted to the Fannin County development officer for review and approval as outlined in section 42-31.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. III, art. I)
Sec. 42-30. - Minor subdivision approval.
All minor subdivisions of land in Fannin County shall be submitted to the Fannin County land development officer for review and approval. The subdivision of one tract into two tracts or the division of property among immediate family members does not require the preparation of a plat; however, the subdivision must be approved by the Fannin County land development officer and the board of assessors office. All minor subdivisions that contain three or up to seven tracts shall submit a final plat that complies with the provisions outlined in section 42-113. The Fannin County land development officer shall review the proposed subdivision for compliance with this article. Any variance from the standards in this article must be approved by the Fannin County board of commissioners.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.100)
Sec. 42-31. - Major subdivision approval.
All major subdivision proposals shall be submitted to the Fannin County land development officer for review and approval. The major subdivision approval process is a four-step process. The process is designed to provide a logical sequence of reviews and events in the subdivision development process. The major subdivision review process shall be as follows:
(1)
Erosion and sedimentation land disturbing application plat/plan. The process begins with the preparation of a plat by a registered land surveyor who is licensed in the State of Georgia (see section 42-567). The plan shall contain the information outlined in section 42-57 and in article X, division 2 of this chapter and shall be reviewed by the Fannin County land development officer and the soil and water conservation commission. This plat/plan is to be approved before any roads or land disturbing activity is started.
(2)
Construction of improvements. The second step in the subdivision process shall be the construction of the necessary improvements to the subdivision (i.e., streets, lot corner stakes, drainage and water systems, if applicable). The developer may wish to involve the health department before the construction phase to help insure against any lot being rendered useless because of the placement of roads or drainage. Construction may be in phases.
(3)
Preliminary plat. Preparation of the preliminary plat must be done by a registered surveyor licensed in the State of Georgia. The plat shall contain the information outlined in section 42-82. The preliminary plat may also be completed in phases. The developer may choose to exercise the provisions of division 8 of this article in the third step of this review process.
(4)
Final plat. Upon completion of the necessary improvements, or following the compliance with the provisions contained in division 8 of this article, the developer shall prepare a final plat, which will serve as an "as-built" drawing for the subdivision. The final plat shall contain the information outlined in section 42-113 and be reviewed and approved as outlined in section 42-114. Upon obtaining approval of the final plat, the developer shall be authorized to record the plat in the Fannin County office of the clerk of the superior court.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.101)
Sec. 42-32. - Tracts three acres or larger.
Parcels being sold tract by tract or sold according to purchasers desire or request, require a boundary survey with an approved erosion and sedimentation control plat/plan. The lots must be three acres or larger. If the roads are not up to county specifications and are not to be accepted into the county road system or if the roads are private, a valid POA (property owners association) or a properly recorded protective covenants and restrictions which clearly establish responsibility for road maintenance must be reviewed and approved by the county attorney. Each lot is subject to Fannin County land development officer and the health department approval before the sale is finalized and cannot be resubdivided without their written approval. When the project is 80 percent complete, the developer shall provide the Fannin County land development office six copies of the entire project with the remaining 20 percent of the lots laid out in three-acre or larger parcels. However, if within two years of the date of completion of the erosion and sedimentation control plat the project is not 80 percent completed, a final plat must be completed of all lots sold and the reminder in three-acre or larger tracts and recorded in the clerk of the superior court of Fannin County's office. Where five or more acres are being subdivided on a stream, a detailed hydrology study must be preformed before construction can take place on the streams.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.102)
Sec. 42-33. - Penalties for not following proper platting procedures and soil erosion measures.
Penalties for not following proper platting procedures and soil erosion measures are as follows (see division 4 of article X of this chapter):
(1)
Denial of building permits until the necessary plat is completed;
(2)
A fee equal to ten times the cost of a building permit that was issued;
(3)
A stop work order;
(4)
Suspension of the building permit; and/or
(5)
Civil penalties being sought in accordance with sections 42-7 and 42-360.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.103)
Sec. 42-34. - Variances.
Where there is a written request from the subdivider, developer, or individual property owner outlining the particulars on how strict compliance of these regulations would cause him/her extraordinary or unnecessary hardships, the subdivider, developer, or individual may apply to the Fannin County board of commissioners or such body as it may by appropriate resolution indicate, to vary certain parts of the regulations of this article, provided that such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the regulations and provided the public interest, health, safety and general welfare is protected.

DIVISION 5. - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN

Sec. 42-142. - Suitability of area proposed for subdividing.
Land which the Fannin County land development office finds to be excessively steep (greater than 40 percent) subject to flooding, poor drainage or having adverse geologic conditions present, shall not be subdivided unless the developer, through the use of engineering reports, demonstrates that the measures he/she proposes to undertake will mitigate the adverse natural features and will not endanger the health, safety or general welfare of the inhabitants of the land of surrounding areas. (See also articles VI—IX of this chapter.)
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.500)
Sec. 42-143. - Compliance with applicable local ordinances and state statutes.
(a)
In addition to the minimum standards outlined in this chapter, all proposed subdivisions shall comply with all applicable local and state ordinances and statutes.
(b)
The Fannin County land development officer will withhold approval of any subdivision that is known to be in conflict with any known ordinances or regulations.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.501)
Sec. 42-144. - Restrictive covenants.
If the developer wishes to place restrictive covenants on the subdivision, such covenants shall be submitted along with the final plat and shall, upon approval, be recorded on a separate form along with the final plat.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.502)
Sec. 42-145. - Naming subdivision.
The name of the subdivision shall be at the discretion of the subdivider so long as the name does not closely approximate the name of a previously platted subdivision in Fannin County.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.503)
Sec. 42-146. - Streets.
The streets in the subdivision may be either public or private. All proposed public streets shall be contiguous to the existing public streets and meet the public street standards that are outlined in division 6 of this article. Streets proposed as private streets shall meet the private street standards as outlined in division 6 of this article. All streets which are proposed as private streets shall comply with the ownership and maintenance provisions outlined in division 9 of this article and are so noted on the final plat.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, § 3.504)
Sec. 42-147. - Lots.
All residential lots that shall hereafter be established in Fannin County shall comply with the following design standards:
(1)
City limits and lot lines. Lots created after the initial adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall not be divided by corporate boundary lines.
(2)
Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to the street lines and radial to curved street lines.
(3)
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform to the building setback lines from both streets.
(4)
Double frontage. Double frontage lots, (i.e., lots having street frontages both in the front and the rear) shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from a railroad or major street right-of-way or where necessary due to the topography. Where a railroad or major street right-of-way, as shown on the major thoroughfare plan, abuts or runs through any portion of the subdivision, the subdivision plan shall provide for either a marginal access or lots backing in said right-of-way having a minimum depth of 200 feet.
(5)
Building lines.
a.
Residential building setback lines shall be at least 35 feet from the right-of-way line on the front property line on roads having a right-of-way of 40 feet or less from the road centerline and at least 25 feet from the right-of-way line on the front property line on roads having a right-of-way of more than 40 feet from the road centerline and at least 15 feet from the side and rear property lines. The front property line shall be deemed to be the property line that is the property line contiguous to the road or street providing access to the lot. The building shall be setback from side and rear lot lines a minimum of 15 feet.
b.
As to any property or lot in which one of the lot lines is either a body of water (including lake, stream, branch, creek or river), the setback line shall be that as required by article X of this chapter, soil erosion and sediment control; article VIII of this chapter, wetlands protection; article VI of this chapter, mountain protection; article IX of this chapter, Toccoa River corridor protection; and article VII of this chapter, water supply/watershed protection.
