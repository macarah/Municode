ARTICLE VI. - PROTECTION OF MOUNTAINS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 42-410. - Purpose of article.
(a)
Findings. The mountains of Georgia are characterized by steep slopes, thin soils, and, because of the natural stresses placed on such environments, they require special protection. Land disturbing activity on the high elevation, steep slope mountains of Georgia potentially threatens the public health, safety, welfare and economic progress of the state. Such land disturbing activity:
(1)
May endanger the quality of surface water by increasing erosion and stream sedimentation;
(2)
Has the potential to induce land slides;
(3)
Has the potential to adversely affect groundwater due to the difficulty in providing proper sewage disposal in areas of steep slope and high elevation;
(4)
May damage the habitat for some species of wildlife (both plants and animals); and
(5)
May detract from the mountain's scenic and natural beauty, which is vital to the recreation and tourism industry of north Georgia.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas within protected mountains as defined herein.
(c)
Authority. This article is enacted pursuant to the authority contained in Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 1 and Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Georgia Constitution, and O.C.G.A. 12-2-8(b), 50.8.7.1(b), and 50-8-2(a)(18)(B).
(d)
Jurisdiction. This article shall apply to the unincorporated areas of Fannin County and to any incorporated area electing to adopt this article.
(e)
Cite. This article shall be known as "Mountain Protection Ordinance as Incorporated in this chapter."
(f)
Interpretation. This article shall be interpreted in conjunction with federal and state rules, regulations and laws, and other Fannin County Ordinances contained or referenced herein.

Sec. 42-411. - Mountain protection district established.
The Mountain Protection District is hereby designated and shall comprise all land area within the jurisdiction of Fannin County, Georgia, that is 2,200 feet or more above mean sea level that has a percentage slope of 25 percent or greater for at least 500 feet horizontally. The district shall also include the crests, summits, and ridge tops which lie at elevations higher than any such area. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Mountain Protection District Map. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference.
(Ord. of 3-12-2002, ch. VIII, art. II)
Sec. 42-412. - Protection criteria.
(a)
Proposed land disturbing activity shall meet all applicable requirements of the "Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended," and all applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control.
(b)
When one or more septic tanks are to be used for individual sewage disposal, the proposed land disturbing activity shall meet all applicable requirements imposed by the local governing authority and the state regulations.
(c)
Where one or more wells are to be used for individual water supply, the proposed land disturbing activity shall meet all applicable requirements of the "Water Well Standards Act of 1985"; the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Department of Human Resources regarding individual or nonpublic wells; and, any more stringent requirements imposed by the local governing authority.
(d)
If sewage treatment is to be provided by any means other than one or more individual septic tanks, the sewage treatment shall meet all applicable requirements of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act."

If a public water supply system is to be provided, the water supply system shall meet all applicable requirements of the "Georgia Safe Drinking Water Act of 1977."
(f)
Single-family dwellings shall not be constructed at a density of more than one per acre and no such acre shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building site. This density restriction shall not apply to:
(1)
Any lot of less than one acre, if such a lot was, as of the date of the initial adoption of this article, owned and described as a discrete parcel of real property according to the instrument of title of the person or persons owning the lot on said date.
(2)
Any lot of less than one acre, if such lot was, as of the date of the initial adoption of this article, shown as a discrete parcel of real property on a plat of survey properly recorded in the real property records of the clerk of the superior court by the person or persons owning the lot on said date.
(3)
Any land, or part of any land, which was contained in or subject to any master plan, planned unit development plan, special approved development plan, or any other development plan if such plan was filed with and approved by the local governing authority prior to the date of the initial adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, pursuant to a duly enacted planning and zoning ordinance; provided further, that any such planning and zoning ordinance must have provided for rules and procedures and governed lot sizes, density, types of buildings, and other limitations usually associated with the implementation of local zoning ordinances.
(g)
Multifamily dwellings, in the absence of a public water supply and sewerage system, shall not be constructed at a density of more than four dwelling units per acre. If there is a public water supply and sewage system available to this property, then the density may be increased to no more than six dwelling units per acre. Regardless of what type of system, no such acre shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building site.
(h)
Structures shall not extend more than 40 feet, as measured from the highest point at which the foundation of such structure intersects the ground, above the uppermost point of the crest, summit, or ridge top of the protected mountain on which the structure is constructed. This height restriction shall not apply to water, radio, or television towers; to any equipment for the transmission of electricity, to minor vertical projections of a parent building, including chimneys, flagpoles, flues, spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, antennas, poles, wires; or to windmills.

Shall identify all trees which are to be removed that exceed eight inches in diameter as measured at a point on the tree 4½ feet above the surface of the ground.
(2)
Shall contain a plan for replacement of any such trees that are removed.
(3)
Shall include a topographical survey of the project site and an assessment of the effect that the project will have on the environment of the protected mountain after the project has been completed and is in operation.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require commercial structures to comply with the density provisions of subsections (f) and (g) of this section.
(j)
No person engaging in land disturbing activity shall remove more than 50 percent of the existing trees that exceed eight inches in diameter as measured at a point on such tree 4½ feet above the surface of the ground, unless such person has filed with the application a plan of reforestation developed by a registered forester.
