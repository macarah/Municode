(1)
Size. In vehicular use areas within the interior of a site, a planting area shall be required which will be equal to four percent of the paved area. Shade trees and other landscaping material shall be planted within such planting area. Interior planting areas shall be located to most effectively relieve the monotony of large expanses of paving and contribute to orderly circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic. All development having paved areas of 12,000 square feet or less shall be exempt from the interior planting requirements.
(2)
