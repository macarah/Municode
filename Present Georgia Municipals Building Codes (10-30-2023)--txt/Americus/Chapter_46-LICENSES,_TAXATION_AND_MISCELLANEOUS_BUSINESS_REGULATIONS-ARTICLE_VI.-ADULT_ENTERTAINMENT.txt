ARTICLE VI. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

Sec. 46-187. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot be a de facto approach to prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of the city's neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
