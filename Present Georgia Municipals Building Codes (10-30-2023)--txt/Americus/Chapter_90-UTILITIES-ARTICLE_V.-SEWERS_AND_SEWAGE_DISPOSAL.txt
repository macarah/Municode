(2)
To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system, which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(3)
To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludges from the system;
(4)
To enable the city to comply with its national pollutant discharge elimination system permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject;
(5)
To provide for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system through issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements for the other users; and
(6)
To authorize monitoring and enforcement activities, user reporting, and provide for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.

Installation of the gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer.
d.
Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the utilities director.
(h)
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45-degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least one-tenth of a foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the utilities director.
(i)
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
(j)
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or a building drain, which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is approved for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage.
(k)

(m)
The city will define the availability of sewers and any costs associated with sewer permits or construction.
(n)
The connection of the property sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or the procedure set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing, any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials, must be approved by the utilities director before installation.
(o)
If any private sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow to the public sewer, the city may:
(1)
Require the owner to repair the private sewer;
(2)
Charge the owner a sewer rate that reflects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property; or
(3)
Require the owner to disconnect his sewer from the city sewer system.

Sec. 90-256. - Restricted use of public sewers; prohibitions.
(a)
A user may not introduce into any public sewer any pollutants that cause passthrough or interference of the POTW. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions in subsection (d) of this section apply to each user introducing pollutants into the POTW whether or not the user is subject to other national pretreatment standards or any national, state, or local pretreatment requirements.
(b)
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted waters such as stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
(c)
Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers or to a natural outlet. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process water may be discharged, upon approval of the state environmental protection division, to a storm sewer, combined sewer or natural outlet.
(d)
Specific prohibitions. Except as herein provided, no person shall discharge any of the following described waters or wastes into any public sewer:
(1)
Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
(2)
Pollutants, which cause corrosive or structural damage to the POTW, but in no case discharges with pH lower than five;
(3)
Solids or viscous pollutants in amounts which cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference;
(4)
Any pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants such as BOD, etc., released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant concentration, which cause interference with the POTW;
(5)
Heat in amounts which inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW plant influent exceeds 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit;
(6)
Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil that will cause interference or passthrough at the POTW;
(7)
Pollutants which will result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in quantities that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance, capable of creating a public nuisance or preventing entry into sewers for their maintenance, inspection, and repair;
(8)
Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW;
(9)
Any water or waste, which contains more than 100 mg/l of fat, oil, or grease, of animal or vegetable origin;
(10)
Any water or waste containing in excess of one mg/l of any of the following hazardous or dangerous gases: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, or nitrous oxide;
(11)
Any nondomestic waters, wastes or materials containing toxic organic and inorganic priority pollutants, unless issued a written permit by the utilities director that provides numerical limits on the quantity of such pollutants. Such limits will be calculated based on national pretreatment standards, local conditions of the POTW; and the presence of any pollutants causing passthrough or interference with the POTW;
(12)
Any waters containing quantities of radium, naturally occurring or artificially produced radioisotopes in excess of presently existing or subsequently accepted limits for drinking water as established by the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measuring;
(13)
Any concentrated dye wastes, or other wastes which are highly colored, and adversely affect the treated effluent of the POTW.
(e)
Local discharge limits. Using EPA approved methodology the city has established local discharge limits for the pollutants of concern to the POTW. These limits are designed to protect the receiving stream, prevent interference with POTW operations and protect the quality of the sludge produced by the POTW. These limits apply to all users of the system. For industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, the local limit will be compared to the categorical limit and the lower value will be used. The city reserves the right to set higher discharge limits for individual industrial users provided that the following conditions apply:
(1)
There are no other industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern or if there are other significant industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern they are discharging below the established limit;
(2)
If any other significant industrial users are discharging the pollutant of concern they agree to accept a lower limit; and
(3)
The total combined loading on the POTW will not exceed the established maximum head works loading.
Any user that desires to have a higher local discharge limit should petition the utilities director in writing.
(f)
Any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of conventional pollutants above the local discharge limit will be subject to surcharges as provided in this division. For purposes of this division conventional pollutants are considered biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, and oil and grease.
(g)
All other regulated pollutants are considered nonconventional pollutants and any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of these pollutants above the local discharge limit will be subject to enforcement action as provided in this division.

Sec. 90-257. - National categorical pretreatment standards.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR chapter 1, subchapter N, parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated by reference.
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the utilities director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the utilities director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(5)
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate.

Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 90-256 within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the utilities director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the utilities director for review, and shall be acceptable to the utilities director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division.
(2)
Additional pretreatment measures.
a.
Whenever deemed necessary, the utilities director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate certain wastewaters to be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division.
b.
The utilities director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain on their own property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
c.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the utilities director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the utilities director and shall be located as to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense.
d.
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(3)
Accidental discharge or slug control plans. At least once every two years, the utilities director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge or slug control plan. The utilities director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the utilities director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge or slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
a.
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
b.
Description of stored chemicals;
c.
Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by subsection (d)(6)a of this section;
d.
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(4)
Hauled waste.
a.
Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the utilities director, and at such times as are established by the utilities director. Such wastes shall not violate section 90-256 or any other requirements established by the city. The utilities director may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. Such permits may be revoked at any time if, in the opinion of the director, continued dumping of such matter into the sewers will be injurious to the sewer system or treatment processes.
b.
A charge shall be made for the privilege of dumping the contents of septic tanks, as provided in separate rules. A record shall be kept of such dumps and statements rendered at the first of each month, the amount of such statements shall be payable within ten days after rendition. Failure to pay the amounts due within such ten-day period shall be cause for revoking the permit.
c.
The utilities director shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The utilities director may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The utilities director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this division.
d.
Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the POTW superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the POTW superintendent. The POTW superintendent may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The POTW superintendent may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
(b)
Wastewater discharge permit application process.

The user is not required to resample if the city monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(9)
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
a.
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge, continuous, batch, or other. If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user:
1.
Identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes;
2.
Estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and
3.
Estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection (d)(9) need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (d)(5) of this section. The notification requirement in this subsection (d)(9) does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (c)(2)a.4 and (e)(1)c of this section.
b.
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (d)(9)a of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
c.
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
d.
In the case of any notification made under this subsection (d)(9), the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
e.
This provision does not create the right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(10)
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(11)
Sample collection.
a.
Except as indicated in subsection (d)(11)b of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
b.
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(12)
Timing. Written reports will be deemed, to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(13)
Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, name of the person taking the samples; the dates analysis were performed; who performed the analysis; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analysis. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city.

Sec. 90-259. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
(a)
Notification of violation. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this division, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the utilities director or his agent may serve upon said user written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the utilities director or his agent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The utilities director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
(c)
Show cause hearing. The utilities director may order any user which causes or contributes to a violation of this division or wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any user. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued.
(d)
Compliance order. When the utilities director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or a permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
(e)
Cease and desist orders. When the utilities director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, the utilities director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
(1)
Comply forthwith;
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
(f)
Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this division, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this division, or permits or orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city shall have such other collection remedies as it needs to collect other individual user's property. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the city to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the utilities director believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the industrial user.
(g)
Emergency suspensions.
(1)
The utilities director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and wastewater permit of a user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment.
(2)
Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the utilities director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utilities director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings set forth in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. A user who is the subject of a suspension order under this subsection shall have the right to appeal to the utilities director from such suspension, but such suspension shall remain in full force and effect pending such hearing and the decision of the director thereto.
(3)
A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the utilities director prior to the date of the hearing described in subsection (g)(2) of this section.
(h)
Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW, must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the public works department. Any user who violates the following conditions of this division or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable state and federal law, is subject to permit termination:
(1)
Violation of permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; or
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling.
Any noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section, why the proposed action should not be taken.
(i)
Termination of services. The city may order any user who causes or continues to allow an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the city council as to why termination of services should not happen. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city council regarding the termination of services, the reasons why the action is to be taken, and directing the user to show cause before the city council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The city council may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the public works to:

(j)
Order from city council to discontinue service. After the city council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service is to be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
(Code 1986, § 13-88; Ord. No. O-98-05-19, 5-21-1998)
Sec. 90-260. - Judicial remedies.
If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, the utilities director, through the city attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(1)
Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city, through counsel may petition the court for its issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both, as may be appropriate, which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user. The city may also initiate nuisance abatement proceedings in the municipal court of the city, as an alternate remedy.
(2)
Civil penalties.
a.
Any user who has violated or continues to violate this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of up to at least $1,000.00 plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages, the city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
b.
The city shall petition the municipal court of the city or any state court having jurisdiction to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In determining the amount of liability, the municipal court of the city or any state court having jurisdiction shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice requires.
(3)
Criminal prosecution.
a.
Any user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this division or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon conviction in the municipal court of the city, be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Sec. 90-261. - Supplemental enforcement remedies.
(a)
Performance bonds. The utilities director may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such user files with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the utilities director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(b)
Liability insurance. The utilities director may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the industrial user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge.
(c)
Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user has been found after a hearing, to be in violation of the provisions of this division or an order issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(Code 1986, § 13-90; Ord. No. O-98-05-19, 5-21-1998)
Sec. 90-262. - Affirmative defenses.
(a)
Treatment upsets.
(1)
For the purposes of this division, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the utilities director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and the plan to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(b)
Treatment bypasses.
(1)
For the purposes of this division:
a.
The term "bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsection (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
Need for bypass known in advance.
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utilities director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice to the utilities director of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utilities director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
A bypass is prohibited, and the utilities director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a.
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance;
c.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (b)(3) of this section; and
d.
The utilities director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the utilities director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection (b)(4).
(c)
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 90-256 or the specific prohibitions in subsections 90-256(d)(1)—(13), if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause passthrough or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the passthrough or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
