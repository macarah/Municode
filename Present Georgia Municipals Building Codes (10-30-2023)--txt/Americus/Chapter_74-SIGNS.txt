Chapter 74 - SIGNS
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 74-1. - Purpose and findings.
The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. The purpose of this chapter is to balance the need to protect the public safety and welfare, the need for a well-maintained and attractive community, and the need for adequate identification, communication, and advertising. There regulations are further intended to:
(1)
Allow businesses, institutions, and people to exercise their right to free speech by displaying messages on a sign, and to allow audiences to receive such information;
(2)
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs and thereby encourage increased communication with the public;
(3)
Ensure that signs are desired constructed, installed and maintained according to minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property and public welfare;
(4)
Reflect and support the desired ambience and development patterns of the various zoning districts and promote an attractive built environment;
(5)
Allow for adequate and effective signs whose dimensional characteristics further the interest of public safety and the needs of the motorist, where signs are viewed from a public right-of-way;
(6)
Promote the state purposes of the city ordinance, as amended, which are expressly incorporated herein;
(7)
Promote the stated purposes of the standard building code, as adopted and modified by the city, which are expressly incorporated herein.
The regulations of this chapter dictate the types, location and physical standards of signs that are permissible for specified uses, subject to the sign permit procedures of the city. The regulations of this chapter shall be in addition to any required provisions of the Georgia Code and the applicable building code administered by the city related to the construction and maintenance of signs.
The regulations of this article shall:
(1)
Govern and control the erection, enlargement, expansion, alteration, operation, maintenance and relocation of any sign that is visible from any public right-of-way or public or private common open space; and
(2)
Govern the removal of signs determined to be physically unsafe or which create a safety hazard to the public.
