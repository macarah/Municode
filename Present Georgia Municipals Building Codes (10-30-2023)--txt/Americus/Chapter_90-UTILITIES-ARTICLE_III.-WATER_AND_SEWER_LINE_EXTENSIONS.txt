ARTICLE III. - WATER AND SEWER LINE EXTENSIONS
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Secs. 90-53—90-77. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - COMMERCIAL AREAS

Sec. 90-78. - Authority to extend; service charges.
(a)
The city council shall be authorized to extend or cause to be extended water main lines and sewer main lines into commercial areas, both inside and outside the city limits where the city council deems it appropriate and in the best interest of the city to do so.
(b)
In considering the extension of such water mains and sewer mains, the city council shall take into consideration past commercial business growth patterns and anticipated commercial business growth patterns, both inside and outside the city limits. The city council shall also weigh the net cost to the city of such extensions against the potential increased revenues to the city realized or anticipated to result from such extensions due to increased economic development activity.
(c)
In the event that the city council determines that it is appropriate to extend water mains and sewer mains into commercial areas, either inside or outside the city limits, the city shall be authorized to charge to new water and sewer customers, in addition to tap charges, service deposits, meter costs and monthly water and sewer rates, an amount determined by the city which will reimburse the city for all reasonable costs of extending such water mains and sewer mains based upon the linear front footage of the property to be served by such water main and sewer main extensions. Such costs need not be paid by a property owner or owners until such time as the property owner or owners desire to purchase city water and city sewer services, and such charges may be paid as part of the initial tap charges otherwise authorized in this Code. In addition to the foregoing, the city shall be authorized to charge interest on such amounts from the date that such water and sewer service becomes available to the date that such charges are paid in an amount to be determined by the city.
(d)
The charges authorized hereunder shall be in addition to all other charges authorized to persons or businesses who utilize city water and city sewer services, whether inside or outside the city limits.
(e)
The commercial business shall be required to pay the full cost of installing water and sewer lines from the main line to a commercial business building or buildings located on the premises, and the city shall have no responsibility or liability therefor.
(f)
The provisions of this section shall not apply to residential subdivisions, or to the extension of water mains and sewer mains by the city to serve a single residence or a single commercial business. Under such circumstances, the city shall be authorized to undertake such extensions and shall be authorized to charge the full cost of such extensions to such residential or commercial customer.

DIVISION 3. - RESIDENTIAL AREAS

Sec. 90-100. - Authority to extend.
The city council shall be authorized to extend or cause to be extended water main lines and sewer main lines into residential areas, both inside and outside the city limits, where the city council deems it appropriate and in the best interest of the city to do so. For purposes of this division, the term "residential areas" shall include all areas inside and outside the city limits which are zoned for any type of residential development.
(Code 1986, § 13-161; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 1, 1-21-1999)
Sec. 90-101. - Investigation; survey; estimated costs.
(a)
In the event that the utilities director shall determine that there is an area within the city or outside the city limits which should have access to city water and city sewerage, the utilities director shall conduct a preliminary investigation of the area to determine the estimated cost, feasibility, and if appropriate, the time frame within which water mains and sewer mains could be installed to serve such area. The utilities director shall then make a written report of his findings to the city manager of the city, who shall review such findings and submit them to the city council for review.
(b)
Upon review of the findings, the city council shall be authorized to undertake one of the following three options:
(1)
The council can determine that the proposed installation of water and sewer lines in such area is not feasible, not cost effective, or is a project that the city should not undertake at the present time.
(2)
In the event that the area studied is an area where residential property has already been developed, then the city council shall be authorized to direct the city manager of the city to undertake a survey of the property owners in the area to determine whether or not they desire the construction of such improvements in the area. An estimated cost of such extension that would have to be paid by such property owners, if any, shall be submitted to said property owners as part of such survey. Unless the city council shall determine that public health and safety concerns exist so as to require such installation, in the discretion of the city council, no such extension shall be undertaken by the city unless at least 60 percent of the property owners in the subject area respond affirmatively to such survey.
(3)
In the event that the subject area has not been developed as a residential area, then the city council shall direct the city manager to conduct a survey, as referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section, of the property owners in the subject area in the same manner. Unless the city council shall determine that public health and safety concerns exist so as to require such installation, in the discretion of the city council, no such extension shall be undertaken by the city unless 100 percent of the property owners in the subject area respond affirmatively to such survey.
(Code 1986, § 13-162; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 2, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015)
Sec. 90-102. - Completion of survey; determination of special or general benefits.
(a)
The survey shall be completed within 90 days after the city manager is directed to commence such survey. In the event that the required percentage approval from the property owners is met as a result of the survey, or in the event that the city council determines that public health and safety concerns exist so as to require the installation of the water and sewer improvements, the city council shall determine whether or not a special benefit will accrue to those property owners gaining access to the city's water and sewer system. In the event that such a special benefit will accrue as determined by the city council, the city council shall compare such special benefit with the general benefit derived by taxpayers of the city in general as a result of such improvements. If the comparison of the special benefit to the general benefit derived by taxpayers of the city in general results in a conclusion that the special benefit to the taxpayers of the subject area in expanding the water and sewer system to said area will outweigh the general benefit derived by taxpayers of the city in general, then in such event, the city council shall determine what portion of the cost of extending the city's water and sewer line to the subject area will be paid by the city, if any. If the city council determines that the general benefit to be derived by taxpayers of the city in general outweighs the special benefit to the property owners in the subject area, then the city shall pay the total cost of the extension of the water and sewer line.
(b)
In the event that the city determines there is a special benefit to the property owners in the subject area, the city shall determine what portion of such cost each property owner shall pay for such water and sewer extension. If finally approved, the portion of the cost of the water and sewer line extension payable by the property owners in the subject area shall be paid to the city in accord with the provisions of this division.
(Code 1986, § 13-163; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 3, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015)
Sec. 90-103. - Boundary of subject area; total costs; assessment.
(a)
At the next regular meeting of the city council after completion of the survey and the tabulations of the results thereof, or at such other time as the city council may determine. The city council may consider a resolution establishing the boundary of the subject area to be served by the water and sewer extensions and identifying all of the property or properties in the subject area which will benefit from access to such extension. Such resolution shall also provide the following:
(1)
The total cost of the proposed project;
(2)
The proposed method of assessment as to each property owner;
(3)
A good faith estimate of the proposed assessment against each property; and
(4)
A date, place, and time for a public hearing to be held on the merits of the project and on any objections thereto.
(b)
Such resolution, if approved by the city council, shall be deemed to conditionally approve the project under the terms and conditions as set out in the resolution, but such project shall not proceed until after the public hearing and after the city council has approved a final resolution approving the project in accord with the terms of such final resolution.
(c)
Notice of the public hearing, referred to in subsection (b) of this section, shall be given to every property owner identified in the preliminary resolution as potentially benefiting from access to the proposed water and sewer line improvements. Such notice shall be given in writing and mailed to such property owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address shown on the city tax digest for the mailing of tax notices. Such notices shall be mailed at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing and shall include a copy of the preliminary resolution as approved by the city council. Such notice shall also specify the date, time, and location of the hearing and advise such property owners of their right to attend said hearing and to testify at said hearing. Such notice shall also be published by the city manager or his designee at least once a week for two consecutive weeks in the legal organ of the city. The time fixed for the public hearing shall be not less than five nor more than ten days after the date of the last publication of such notice.
(d)
The city council shall hold the public hearing on the date, time, and place specified for the purpose of hearing supporting comments, complaints, objections that may be made by any interested persons concerning the project, including, but not limited to, the need for such water and sewer extension, the basis of apportioning costs between the city and the property owners, or the amount of the proposed assessment. The city council shall consider such comments and shall also be authorized to accept written comments from interested parties.
(e)
At the next regular meeting of the city council, or at such other time as the city council may direct, the city council shall be authorized to consider a final resolution authorizing the project. Such resolution shall not be approved at the meeting at which it is first read without unanimous consent of the members of the city council, but shall be voted upon by the city council at the time of the second reading of such resolution. Such resolution shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following determinations.
(1)
The boundary of the subject area to be served by the water and sewer extension;
(2)
The projected cost of the improvements;
(3)
The proposed method of assessment of such costs against the property owners;

(Code 1986, § 13-164; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 4, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015)
Sec. 90-104. - Notice of assessment.
(a)
The city manager of the city, or his designee, shall, not less than 30 days before the date on which the payment of an assessment shall be due, cause written notice of such assessment to be sent to each affected property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall inform the property owner of the amount of the assessment, that the assessment is payable to the finance director of the city, that if paid on or before the due date, such assessment shall be without interest, and that if such assessment is not paid by the due date, the amount of such assessment shall be a lien against the lot or tracts of land subject to the assessment, and such lien shall continue in force until the assessment and all interest is fully paid. The interest to be charged on assessments not paid when due shall be determined by the city council in the final resolution in section 90-103.
(b)
In addition to the foregoing notice of the property owner's right to pay such assessment in installments, as provided in this division, shall also be contained in the notice required under this section.
(Code 1986, § 13-165; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 5, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. O-04-12-33, 12-16-2004; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015)
Sec. 90-105. - Action to enjoin or contest assessments.
No action shall be authorized to set aside any assessment, to enjoin the collection of any assessment, to enjoin the issuance of any execution therefor, or to contest the validity of an assessment on any legal or equitable grounds, unless such action is commenced within 30 days after the receipt of the notice provided for in section 90-104.
(Code 1986, § 13-166; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 6, 1-21-1999)
Sec. 90-106. - Payment of assessment by installments.
When an assessment is imposed against a property owner for the installation of water and sewer lines as set out in this division, and the property owner desires to pay the assessment in installments, the property owner shall be authorized to pay such assessment in installments if notice of such election shall be given by the property to the chief administrator officer of the city on or before the due date of the assessment, subject to the following terms:
(1)
The assessment may be amortized over such length of time as requested by the property owner, but no such assessment may be amortized over more than seven years.
(2)
The interest rate to be charged to a property owner shall be based upon the cost of funds to the city in connection with such project, plus administrative expenses and costs incurred by the city in administering the payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the water and sewer line extension project is paid for with cash funds from the city's water and sewer fund, the interest rate to be charged to property owners who amortize their assessment shall be the rate that the money expended for such extension would have earned if such money had been invested in one-year certificates of deposit, plus administrative expenses and costs incurred by the city in administering the payments.
(3)
Each assessment amortized, as provided in this section, shall be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal and interest according to an amortization schedule provided by the city manager. Such assessments shall be evidenced by a promissory note and such other documents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to evidence such indebtedness and to secure the repayment thereof. In the event that the property owner is a utility customer of the city, the city shall be authorized to add the monthly installment to the monthly utility bill of the property owner. In the event the property owner is not a utility customer of the city, a monthly installment shall be billed to the property owner by the city.
(4)
The amount of the assessment shall be a lien against the property of the property owner subject to such assessment until such time as all principal and interest are fully paid. Such liens shall be levied, enforced, and collected in the same manner as provided for the collection of city taxes.
(5)
In the event that any installment is not paid in full when due, the finance director of the city shall be authorized to notify the property owner that the assessment is in default and such officer shall be further authorized to declare the entire unpaid balance, with interest, costs, and expenses, immediately due and payable.
(6)
Upon the sale, donation, gift, or other transfer by operation of law of any real property subject to such a lien, such assessment shall be due and payable in full at the time of such transfer; provided, however, that transfers of property solely for the purpose of securing a bona fide indebtedness of the property owner shall not require payment in full of such lien upon such transfer.
(7)
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section regarding the repayment of such assessments amortized over a period of years, in the event that the subject area has no residential dwellings located on it at the time of the approval of the final resolution approving the project as provided in this division, then, in such event, the property owners shall be authorized to enter into an agreement with the city to provide that such assessment shall be paid, with interest as aforesaid, at the time that each lot in the proposed development is sold, provided that the entire assessment, whether or not all lots subject to such assessment have been sold, shall be paid no later than seven years from the initial due date of the assessment. All other provisions of this division relating to interest rates, liens for assessments, and default shall be applicable to such property owners.

All assessments levied and collected under this division shall be retained by the finance director of the city in a special fund to be used and applied for the payment of expenses incurred in installing and extending water and sewer lines for the project identified in the final resolution referred to in this division. No money in said special fund shall be used for any other purpose until such time as all costs of such project have been paid in full. In the event that any funds remain in the special fund after the project has been paid for in full, then such remaining funds shall be transferred to the city water and sewer fund.
(Code 1986, § 13-168; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 8, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. O-04-12-33, 12-16-2004)
Sec. 90-108. - Property required to connect and pay monthly usage cost.
Upon approval of the final resolution referred to in this division authorizing the commencement of the project in the subject area, the city shall be authorized to require that each property in the subject area which is to benefit from the extension of the water and sewer lines as a result of such project shall be required to connect to such water and sewer lines and pay the monthly usage cost as established under this chapter, in addition to the payment of such assessments as may be levied under the terms of this division.

(Ord. No. O-2013-24, 9-19-2013)
Sec. 90-112. - Initial review of application.
If the property to be annexed is "qualified property" as defined in this division, and if the property owner makes appropriate application for the extension of water and sewer services to the property to be annexed under this division, then the community development department, working in conjunction with the city utilities department and the city fire and emergency services department, shall undertake an initial review of the application. If such departments determine, as a result of such initial review, that the property to be annexed is "qualified property" under this division, then the departments shall jointly determine whether it is economically feasible from a financial standpoint for the governing body to provide the property owner, as a condition of annexation, reduced costs and fees for water line extensions, sewer line extensions, water tap fees, and sewer tap fees. No such cost or fee reductions shall be authorized unless the net cost of such project shall result in a financial benefit to the city.
(Ord. No. O-2013-24, 9-19-2013)
Sec. 90-113. - Financial benefit determination.
In determining financial benefit to the city in connection with such project, said departments shall perform a cost analysis to determine the cost of water line extensions, sewer line extensions, water tap fees, and sewer tap fees to the subject property.

Cost to extend water lines;
(2)
Cost to extend sewer lines;
(3)

(8)
Any other information that either department deems appropriate to include in connection with such analysis.
(Ord. No. O-2013-24, 9-19-2013)
Sec. 90-114. - Recommendation to city council.
The departments shall jointly recommend to the governing body of the city the actual amount of fee reductions, if any, that would be authorized for the proposed project based upon such calculations conditioned upon the subject property being annexed into the city; provided, however, that in no event shall fee reductions exceed a seven-year payback to the city which shall be calculated solely based upon increased ad valorem tax revenue to the city generated by the subject property.
(Ord. No. O-2013-24, 9-19-2013)
Sec. 90-115. - Payment of fees in installments under certain circumstances.
With respect to any water line extension costs, sewer line extensions costs, water tap fees, or sewer tap fees which are to be paid by a property owner annexing property into the city: (i) where the subject property is not qualified property as defined in section 90-111; (ii) where all or a portion of such fees are not subject to a reduction under section 90-114 above; or (iii) where the governing body of the city does not approve a fee reduction with respect to a particular application, the property owner may apply to the city to pay such costs and fees in installments. The property owner's application to pay such costs and fees, or a portion thereof, in installments may be authorized if approved by the governing body of the city, subject to the following terms:
(1)
The governing body of the city must determine, based upon the financial benefit determination, that the project would bring economic development to the city in the form of increased private sector employment, increased ad valorem tax revenue to the city, or increased net revenue to the city's utility system.
(2)
The costs and fees may be amortized over such length of time as approved by the governing body of the city, but the repayment of such costs and fees may not be amortized over a period of more than seven years.
(3)
The interest rate to be charged to a property owner in connection with the payment of such installment payments shall be as determined by the governing body of the city, taking into account the cost of funds to the city in connection with the project, current prevailing interest rates in the private sector, plus administrative costs and expenses incurred and to be incurred by the city in collecting and administering such installment payments.
(4)
Such costs and fees to be paid in installments shall be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal and interest according to a written amortization schedule. At the time that the city and the property owner agree to the monthly repayment amounts, the property owner shall execute and deliver to the city the property owner's promissory note and such other documents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to evidence such indebtedness and to secure the repayment thereof. In the event that the property owner is a utility customer of the city, the city shall be authorized to add the monthly installment payment to the monthly utility bill of the property owner or the property owner's tenant in the case of leased property.
(5)
Prior to any installment payment being authorized under this section, the property owner must be determined by the governing body to be sufficiently creditworthy to insure to the governing body, to the extent reasonably possible, that the property owner will have the financial ability to pay such indebtedness within the term established by the city.
(6)
The amount of the costs and fees to be paid in installments shall constitute a lien against the property of the property owner benefitted by such utility services until such time as all principal and interest are paid in full. Evidence of such lien shall be executed by the property owner and shall be recorded in the deed records in the Office the Clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County, Georgia. The city clerk shall be authorized to cancel such lien upon the full payment thereof. Such liens shall be levied, enforced, and collected in the same manner as provided for the collection of city ad valorem taxes.
(7)
Upon the sale, donation, gift, foreclosure, or the transfer of or operation of law of all or a portion of the real property subject to such lien, any remaining unpaid amounts of such costs and fees shall be due and payable in full at the time of such transfer unless the governing body of the city approves the assumption of such remaining obligations by the person or entity acquiring all or a portion of the subject property.
