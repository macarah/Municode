Sec. 4-122. - Retail sales of wine and malt beverages - distances from certain uses.
Subject to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 3-3-21, as amended:
(a)
No license for retail sales of wine and malt beverages packaged to go shall be issued under this Article where the location of the business is within 100 yards of any of the following: a school ground, school building, or college campus, an alcoholic treatment center, a public library or any branch thereof, any Macon-Bibb County Housing Authority property, any church or church grounds, or any Macon-Bibb County recreation center property. The distance prescribed in this Section shall be measured by the shortest straight line possible between the nearest point on the building housing the place of business to the nearest point on the building housing such library or branch, school, alcoholic treatment center, or church, or to the nearest point on the school ground, college campus, Macon-Bibb County Housing Authority Property, church ground, or recreation center property.
(b)
No license for retail sales of wine and malt beverages for consumption on the premises shall be issued under this Article where the location of the business is within 100 yards of a state or county owned and operated alcohol treatment center or a housing authority property as defined in O.C.G.A. § 3-3-21.
(c)
When a license is issued for a location which conforms to the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section at the time of issuance, then licenses may be continued to be issued or renewed for the same location thereafter, so long as the sale of alcoholic beverages by the package to go was lawful at such location at any time in the previous twelve months, notwithstanding the fact that an adjacent or nearby property is subsequently devoted to a use which would have precluded issuance of a license in the first instance.
(d)
Subsection (a) shall not prohibit grocery stores licensed for the sale of only wine and malt beverages for consumption off the premises from selling wine and malt beverages within 100 yards of any college campus.
(Ord. No. O-18-0109 , § 1, 12-4-2018; Ord. No. O-21-0024 , § 2, 3-16-2021)

(b)
An applicant for a license for retail sales of wine and malt beverages shall specify in his or her application for a license whether he or she wishes to engage in package sales of wine and malt beverages or sales of wine and malt beverages for consumption on the premises. All licensees shall comply strictly with the varying rules and regulations relating to types of sales of malt beverages and wine hereinafter expressed. Where an applicant desires to sell packaged malt beverages and wine and for consumption on the premises, he or she shall file two applications. The commission or its designee will act upon each application separately. No person shall sell beer or wine or both either packaged or for consumption on the premises unless the application for such sale has been granted by the commission or its designee.

Sec. 4-127. - Wine tasting.
(a)
A wine-tasting permit for purposes of this Section shall be available only to licensees possessing or applicants applying for a license under this Chapter for the retail sale of wine by the package. No retailer engaged in the business of selling wine by the package shall offer tastings, samples, or free glasses of wine for consumption on-premises unless they possess a wine-tasting permit. No such permit shall be required for businesses licensed to sell wine for consumption on-premises, or which provide wine exclusively in a manner which does not constitute a "sale," within the scope of this Chapter.
(b)
No wine-tasting shall be conducted on the premises of any place of business licensed to sell distilled spirits in the unbroken container. Any wine-tasting occurring on the premises of a business possessing a license to sell wine by the package shall be limited to an area that is separated from the retail area of the premises by walls or other partitions that prohibit pedestrian traffic through the wine-tasting area.
(c)
An eligible licensee may petition Macon-Bibb County for a wine-tasting permit provided it meets all requirements of the alcohol beverage ordinance and presently maintains a valid license for the sale of wine by the package issued by Macon-Bibb County. A wine-tasting permit shall allow the permittee to offer or sell wine samples in connection with an instructional or educational promotion. A wine-tasting permit is intended to allow such activity on a limited basis and shall not be a part of the core operations of such establishment or occur on a daily basis.
(d)
A wine-tasting permittee shall be subject to all laws, rules and regulations of Macon-Bibb County and state, including rule 560-2-5-.05 of the state department of revenue, alcohol and tobacco division, and shall be subject to permit revocation for violation thereof.

Said wine-tasting permit need only be applied for once and shall automatically renew when said license to sell wine by the package is renewed. Provided, however, that Macon-Bibb County may revoke such wine-tasting permit and/or impose such conditions on its operation at the commission or its designee's discretion for violation of this Code or in furtherance of the health, safety and welfare of the local government's inhabitants.
(f)
Wine-tastings shall only be conducted during the hours established for the sale of alcoholic beverages consumed on-premises as established in this Chapter.
(g)
Holders of a wine-tasting permit shall not allow any person to take an open container of alcoholic beverages from the designated wine-tasting area or from the licensed premises.
(Ord. No. O-18-0109 , § 1, 12-4-2018)
Sec. 4-128. - Growlers.
The sale of growlers in compliance with this chapter is authorized for establishments licensed under Subsection 4-124(a)(1) for the retail package sales of wine and malt beverages, including holders of a brewpub or malt beverage taproom license. The filling of growlers by means of a tapped keg shall not constitute the breaking of a package as contemplated by O.C.G.A. § 3-3-26 or other provisions of this chapter. The term "growler" means a glass bottle not to exceed sixty-four ounces (64 oz.) that is filled by a licensee or employee of the licensed establishment with beer from a keg. Unless a licensee has a brewpub or malt beverage taproom license, growlers may only be filled from kegs procured by the licensee from a duly licensed wholesaler. Brewpub or malt beverage taproom licensees may also fill growlers with malt beverages manufactured on the licensed premises. Only professionally sanitized and sealed growlers may be filled and made available for retail sale. Each growler must be securely sealed and removed from the premises in its original sealed condition. Samples of tap beers may be made available if the licensee is providing growlers in compliance with this chapter, but shall not exceed one ounce (1 oz.) nor shall any one (1) individual be offered more than three (3) samples within a twenty-four-hour (24 hr.) period. An establishment duly licensed for the sale of growlers may also be authorized to sell other forms of alcoholic beverages, including for consumption on-premises, so long as it is properly licensed to do so.
