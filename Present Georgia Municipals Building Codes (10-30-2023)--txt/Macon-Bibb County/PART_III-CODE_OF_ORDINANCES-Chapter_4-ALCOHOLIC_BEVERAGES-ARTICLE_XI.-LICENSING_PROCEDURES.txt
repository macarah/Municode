Each such renewal application was timely submitted, and all renewal fees were timely paid;
(2)
Each such renewal is limited only to licenses presently held by the applicant, and does not seek to add to the categories of licenses held by that applicant; provided, however, that an application seeking to renew some, but fewer than all, categories of licenses currently held under this Chapter may still be included in a bulk recommendation to approve renewal under this paragraph;

Sec. 4-412. - Requests to modify or remove conditions imposed.
(a)
Where any condition is imposed on any licensee under this Chapter in lieu of denying issuance, renewal, or transfer of a license, or in lieu of revoking any license, the licensee shall have no opportunity to challenge or seek removal or modification of the conditions imposed for a period of one year from the later of the date on which the conditions were first imposed or the date on which any appeal affirming the imposition of any or all conditions became final.
(b)
After the expiration of the time period set out in subsection (a), above, any licensee shall be authorized to request in writing that the Sheriff undertake a review as to the ongoing appropriateness of the conditions imposed upon said license. The request shall identify those particular conditions which the licensee would like to have modified or removed, and shall include any information or evidence supporting the licensee's request which the licensee would like the Sheriff to consider. The request shall be submitted to the Department of Business Development Services, which shall promptly forward copies of the same to the Sheriff, the Clerk of the Macon-Bibb County Commission, and the County Attorney.
(c)
Upon receipt of a request to modify or remove any conditions imposed, the Sheriff shall review the site and activities of the licensee in the manner described in Subsection 4-402(c). The Sheriff shall consider all materials submitted by the licensee as part of this review, and shall prepare a written report and recommendation as described in Subsection 4-402(d), including particular recommendations as to each request made by the licensee to modify or remove any conditions previously imposed. In the event that a condition is to be modified, it need not be modified in the manner or to the degree requested by the licensee.
(d)
The Sheriff's review under this Section shall be plenary, and nothing in this Section shall prevent the Sheriff from recommending the imposition of new conditions upon any licensee in lieu of revocation of any licenses, or from recommending the revocation of any license if the Sheriff learns of information during such review which would support any such recommendation; provided that no conditions previously imposed shall be made more restrictive, and no other Adverse Actions shall be taken, based on information which was previously disclosed as part of an application by the licensee to obtain, renew, or transfer any license under this Chapter, or as part of any proceedings relating to the consideration thereof.
(e)
Copies of any review completed under this Section shall be forwarded to the Department of Business Development Services, the Macon-Bibb County Commission, and the County Attorney. Upon receipt by the Macon-Bibb County Commission, further proceedings shall continue as under Subsection 4-403(a), and all subsequent procedures shall be identical to those procedures which apply to recommendations made by the Sheriff pursuant to Section 4-402.
(f)
Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the Sheriff from including any licenses reviewed pursuant to this Section as part of a bulk recommendation for renewal under Subsection 4-402(b), if all requirements for doing so are met.
(g)
No licensee shall have the right to request any modification or removal of conditions imposed while any prior request made under this Section is pending, or for a period of one year after the later of the date upon which a final decision is made on any prior request under this Section or the date on which any appeal affirming an Adverse Action taken as a result of any prior request made under this Section becomes final.
