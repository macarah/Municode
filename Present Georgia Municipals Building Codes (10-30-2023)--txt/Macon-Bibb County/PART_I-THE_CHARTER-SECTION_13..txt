SECTION 13.
The commission, upon the approval of the mayor and five commissioners or upon the approval of six commissioners, may initiate inquiries and investigations into the affairs of the restructured government and the conduct of any department, office, or agency of the restructured government or any joint or independent commission, board, or authority of the restructured government. Any participant in any hearing authorized may request that such hearing be closed to the public and all reports to the commission of the result of any inquiry or investigation by an authorized committee may be closed to the public; provided, however, that all such hearings shall be subject to Chapter 14 of Title 50 of the O.C.G.A., relating to open and public meetings. Any action taken by the commission as a result of such inquiry or investigation shall be taken at and during an open meeting.
