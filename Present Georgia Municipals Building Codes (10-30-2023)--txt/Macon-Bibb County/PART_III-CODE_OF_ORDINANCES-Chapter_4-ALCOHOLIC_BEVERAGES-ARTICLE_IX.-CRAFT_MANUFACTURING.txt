ARTICLE IX. - CRAFT MANUFACTURING

Sec. 4-300. - Brewpub license.
(a)
For purposes of this Chapter, the terms "brewpub" and "eating establishment" shall have the same definitions as provided in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2. No person or entity shall be eligible to obtain a brewpub license unless that person certifies in writing that the premises to be licensed will operate as an eating establishment. Any brewpub license shall be subject to revocation if, at any time, the licensed premises ceases operating as an eating establishment.
(b)
The percentage of gross food and beverage sales shall be calculated and verified as follows:
(1)
Brewpub licensees that have been in operation for more than six months as of the date in which the licensee applies to renew its licenses under this Chapter for the succeeding calendar year shall submit a return, as part of its renewal application, showing its gross sales for the twelve complete calendar months immediately preceding the date of application; or, for each complete calendar month of operations preceding the date of application in which the licensee has been in operation, and demonstrating that its sales of prepared meals or food equal or exceed fifty percent of all gross sales of food and beverage items over the period covered by such return, as set out in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2.
(2)
The Office of Business Development, or its successor office, shall be authorized to prepare a return form upon which calculations of percentages of gross food and beverage sales shall be presented; and such office shall further be authorized to require that all such returns be submitted on the prepared form.
(3)
In the event that a brewpub applying for renewal under this Section cannot demonstrate that its sales of prepared meals or food equal or exceed fifty percent of all gross sales of food and beverage items over the period covered by such return, as set out in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2, then it shall not be permitted to renew its brewpub license. However, such business may instead obtain either a license for the manufacture of malt beverages; or licenses for retail sale of alcoholic beverages, but not both, by paying the appropriate license fees for the desired licenses.
(c)
Any licensee holding a brewpub license shall be authorized to do the following:
(1)
Manufacture on the licensed premises not more than 10,000 barrels of malt beverages in a calendar year solely for retail sale;
(2)
Operate an eating establishment that shall be the sole retail outlet for such malt beverages, and which eating establishment may sell such malt beverages by the drink for consumption on-premises, or by the package for consumption off-premises;
(3)
Provided that the licensee offers for sale for consumption on-premises at least one variety of commercially available canned or bottled malt beverage that is manufactured off-premises and purchased from a licensed wholesaler, exercise all rights afforded to holders of licenses to sell malt beverages or wine by the drink for consumption on-premises, and exercise all rights afforded to holders of licenses to sell malt beverages or wine by the package for consumption off-premises;
(4)
Sell alcoholic beverages pursuant to this Section on all days and at all times that sales of alcoholic beverages by retailers are lawful under this Chapter, including, but not limited to, Sundays;
(5)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, sell up to a maximum of 5,000 barrels annually of such malt beverages to licensed wholesale dealers. Under no circumstances shall such malt beverages be sold by a brewpub licensee to any person holding a retail consumption dealer's license or a retailer's license for the purpose of resale; and
(6)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, sell growlers of malt beverages manufactured on the licensed premises directly to consumers, and sell growlers of malt beverages produced by other manufacturers directly to consumers, provided that the products of other manufacturers are purchased from a licensed wholesaler.
(d)
No person or entity may hold a brewpub license and a license for the sale of distilled spirits by the package for consumption off-premises at the same time.
(e)
Brewpub licensees may separately obtain and hold licenses for alcoholic beverage caterer; brown bagging permit; catered or special event permit; wine-tasting permit; or retail sale of distilled spirits by the drink for consumption of [off-] premises, provided they meet all applicable qualifications for each such license applied for.
