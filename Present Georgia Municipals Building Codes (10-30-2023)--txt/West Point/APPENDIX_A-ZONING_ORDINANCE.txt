Any use permitted in the R-2, multiple family district, with the following restrictions:
(a)
Before an owner of property in the city applies for RPUD-1 designation for any property, a preliminary concept plan shall be submitted to the planning director along with a rezoning request. After preliminary review by the city staff, a public hearing shall be conducted by the municipal planning board on the rezoning request. A recommendation by the planning board on the rezoning request and concept plan shall be submitted to the mayor and council for approval at the next available meeting which shall be a public hearing.
Upon of approval of the rezoning, a preliminary master plan shall be submitted to the planning board for review. Said preliminary master plan shall generally conform to the technical requirements of a preliminary plat as described in the subdivision regulations and shall designate the specific residential use of each area to be developed. Within thirty (30) days of the planning board review a report of its recommendation concerning the preliminary master plan shall be forwarded to the mayor and council for approval at the next available meeting.
(b)
To be considered for designation as an RPUD-1 district, a development must be at least fifty (50) acres in overall size.
(c)
Not less than ten (10) percent of the total area within the development shall be set aside as permanently open, undeveloped land. It is the intent of this ordinance that such open areas will be adequate to act as buffers between areas of differing use or density within a development in this district.
(d)
Areas identified on the master plan for a residential planned unit development as "open," or "undeveloped" shall remain undeveloped in a natural state permanently, although nothing in this section shall prevent the owner from planting additional trees and shrubbery as needed to create an effective buffer or removing injurious growth to maintain the areas. Maintenance of "open" or "undeveloped" areas shall be solely the responsibility of the owner and not the city.
(e)
All lots within the district shall have a required front yard not less than fifteen (15) feet, a rear yard not less than twenty (20) feet and a side yard not less than five (5) feet.

For every area to be developed within a single residential planned unit development the owner shall submit a preliminary plat for consideration by the municipal planning board. These plats will be evaluated based on their conformity to the city's subdivision regulations, conformity to the preliminary master plan as submitted and approved, the need for such development in the city and the adequacy of utilities and improvements to be provided. Upon approval of a final plat for the last area to be developed, the preliminary master plan will become the final master plan for the residential planned unit development.
(g)
Significant changes to the master plan must be approved by the mayor and council after a public hearing. Examples of significant changes are an increase in the total number of individual housing units to be developed, a decrease in the amount of land held as "open" areas, or changes in the locations of streets that will affect traffic flow through the development.

Section 17. - Quality Development Corridor Overlay District (QDC).
The purpose of the Quality Development Corridor Overlay District (QDC) is to provide for a superior environment along transportation corridors through the application of an overlay district. The overlay zone regulations are intended to supplement the regulation of the underlying zoning districts and to provide for harmony and compatibility of non-residential development over the length of the corridor. This district is established to protect the public investment in major highways and arterial streets and ensure that these can continue to serve their primary functions of moving volumes of traffic safely. Provisions of the QDC are intended to expedite the free flow of traffic and reduce the hazard arising from unnecessary points of ingress and egress and cluttered roadside commercial development. The district is intended to enhance the value of adjacent lands by preserving and extending the useful life of the highway, avoiding land uses that conflict with the roadside and the surrounding area and reducing the risks of creating blighted areas. Insuring the attractiveness of roadside uses will contribute to and enhance trade, tourism, capital investment and general welfare.

Section 22A. - Landscaping requirements, non-residential property.
1.
General. The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the installation of trees and landscaping as part of the land development process in order to enhance the quality of life within the city. The reasons for requiring trees on a site and in parking lots are to provide shade, reduce temperatures, reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce air and water pollution.
The following regulations seek to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to achieve a healthy, beautiful, and safe community and to enhance the city's environmental and visual character for its citizens' use and enjoyment by the following means:
(1)
Improve environmental quality by recognizing the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment such as improving air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; reducing and reversing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation.
(2)
Maintain and increase the value of land by requiring landscaping to be incorporated into development, thus becoming by itself a valuable capital asset.
(3)
Provide direct and important physical and psychological benefits to human beings through the use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare, and to break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspects of urban development.
(4)
Preserve existing natural vegetation where possible and incorporate native plants, plant communities, and ecosystems into landscape design.
2.
Definitions.
(1)
Landscape plan: A component of a development, site, or other plan to show the details of landscaping required by this ordinance.

Section 25. - Annexation zoning policy.
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a mechanism whereby land, which is subject to annexation by the City of West Point, shall be evaluated and a zoning district be decided upon to apply said land upon the annexation becoming final.
1.
Annexation zoning process. Upon receipt of an application for annexation of property to the city, such application shall be placed on an agenda of city council meeting within sixty (60) days of the filing of such application.
(1)
Procedure for annexation, specifically. Petitioners for annexation must present to the planning director the following:
a.
A petition for annexation into the City of West Point, Georgia (which shall be in the form of a letter and include the petitioners name, mailing address, contact telephone number, and the address or tax map number of the property proposed for annexation).
b.
A legal description of the property.
c.
A survey by a licensed and registered land surveyor (which shall show, at a minimum, the extents of the property, size of acres, adjacent property owners, and the existing city limits line). Five (5) plats eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches and one (1) eleven (11) inch by seventeen (17) inch plat shall be submitted with the application for annexation.
The city shall notify Troup or Harris County of intent to annex within the time frame specified in section 25.2 below. Upon receiving a recommendation from the planning commission, the city council may choose to proceed with annexation of the property. Upon approval of annexation of the property and placing a zoning designation with the property, the city shall submit the proposed annexation to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for review. Upon review and favorable comment from DOJ, the annexation is officially in place.
The procedure for rezoning of the property is identical to that of a conventional rezoning except that the hearing before the council shall be conducted simultaneously to the annexation of the subject property into the city.
The zoning classification approved by the city following the hearing shall become effective on the later of:
(1)
The date the zoning is approved by the council; and
(2)
The date the annexation becomes effective pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 30-30-4.
2.
House Bill 489. All annexation into the City of West Point shall meet all of the requirements for resolution of land use conflicts as required by State House Bill 489. The following procedure has been adopted as part of this legislation:
1)
Definitions. The following definitions have been adopted specifically to carry out the procedures for this process. The implementation of any of the following definitions shall not have the effect of nullifying the implementation of any other definition.
a.
Affected local government—"The Affected"—means the county or any municipality within one thousand (1,000) feet of the property to be annexed.
b.
Bona fide land use classification objection—As it relates to this process, a bona fide land use classification objection is an objection to a proposed land use of an annexation petition which results in a substantial change in the intensity of the allowable use of the property or a change to a significantly different allowable use. Examples of bona fide land use classification impacts are: Negative effects on surrounding property, increase in traffic loads, environmental impacts, and/or additional public service needs.
c.
Comprehensive plan—Means any plan by a county or municipality covering such county or municipality proposed or prepared pursuant to the minimum standards and procedures for preparation of comprehensive plans and for implementation of comprehensive plans established by the department of community affairs.
d.
Future land use map—A required component of the comprehensive plan that shows graphically how a community wishes land uses to be designated and developed, usually over a twenty (20) year or long period.
e.
Impact—Any negative effect on a piece of land brought about by a government through an annexation.
f.
The initiator—Although not expressly defined in H.B. 489, means the county or municipality proposing annexation of property into proposing entity's jurisdictional limits.
g.
Peculiar topography or site conditions—Means topography or other features that could cause unusually significant harm due to intense and incompatible adjacent development.
h.
Significantly different allowable use—Means a use in a more intensive land use category such as:
(1)
Office/Institutional versus Residential.
(2)
Commercial versus Residential.
(3)
Industrial versus Residential.
(4)
Industrial versus Commercial.
i.
Substantial change in intensity—Substantial change in the intensity of a proposed land use shall be defined as follows:
(1)
If land use proposed is in a category of lesser impact—Not Substantial;
(2)
If land use proposed is in the same general category of impact and is an increase in density of less than or equal to twenty-five (25) percent of the adjoining land within the adjacent jurisdiction—Not Substantial;
(3)
If land use proposed is in the same general category of impact and is an increase in density of greater than twenty-five (25) percent of the adjoining land within the adjacent jurisdiction—Substantial; or
(4)
If the land use proposed is in the same general category of impact and results in a substantial change in intensity, verified by the affected party, which negatively affects surrounding property, increases traffic loads, presents environmental impacts and/or additional public service needs—Substantial.
j.
Unique development—Means development of a one-of-a-kind nature such as a sports arena, stadium, race track, amusement park, university, or other similar developments.
k.
Unusual development—Means development that is uncommon or rarely proposed for the region.
2)
Amendment. This process shall be used when a local government receives an annexation request, or initiates an annexation. An amendment as this term is used in this agreement shall not include the annexation of any unincorporated island (as that term is defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-36-90) containing fifty (50) acres or less.
3)
Notification. "The Initiator" shall notify other affected local governments of the proposed land use of an area to be annexed within five (5) business days of receipt of this request for annexation. This notification shall include all relevant data pertaining to the proposed land use of the area to be annexed.
4)
Determination/intent to object. Within thirty (30) business days after notification, "the Affected" shall make a land use compatibility determination of whether the proposed use of the area to be annexed would create a land use conflict.
The determination is first reviewed by "the Affected(s)" professional planning staff or appointee(s) in the absence of a planning staff. "The Affected(s)" planning staff or appointee(s) shall notify "The Initiator" and "the Affected(s)" governing body within fifteen (15) business days after "the Initiator" serves notification of their intent to object recommendation. The notification shall be a written recommendation based on bona fide land use classification objections.
Prior to the end of the "the Affected" review period, i.e., the thirty (30) business days, "the Affected(s)" governing body shall consider the intent to object recommendation for final action.
If "the Affected(s)" governing body confirms by an affirmative vote an objection as permitted for herein, "the Affected" shall document in writing the nature of the objection and the documentation shall be submitted to "the Initiator" prior to the end of the review period.
The absence of said notification by "the Affected" shall be construed to mean that "the Affected" does not identify land use conflicts created by the annexation and "the Initiator" may proceed with the annexation, in compliance with applicable State or local laws and ordinances.
5)
Mitigation. Representatives of "the Affected" and "the Initiator", which shall be selected by the governing bodies to act on their behalf, shall have ten (10) business days from "the Initiator's" receipt of the objections to meet and devise mitigative measures to address the specific use conflicts created by the proposed annexation. Such mitigative measures can include, but not be limited to, more restrictive development standards such as increasing buffers and/or building setbacks, building height, landscaping requirements, traffic control, storm water control, or other measures designed to mitigate conflicts resulting from adjacent land uses.
Governing bodies of "the Affected" and "the Initiator" shall approve any mitigative actions identified during the mitigation process at their next available public meeting, but no later than fifteen (15) business days after the mitigative actions are identified by local representatives.
Once "the Initiator" and "the Affected" agree that the mitigative measures are reasonable to address the specific use conflicts created by the proposed annexation then "the Initiator" shall impose said condition as prescribed in the selected mitigative measures as conditions of approval for the annexation of the property.
6)
Appeals board. If at the end of the mitigation process "the Initiator" and "the Affected" cannot agree to a resolution of the objection through mitigative measures, then the dispute shall be referred to a Board of Annexation Appeals which shall be composed of five (5) members (unless more than one (1) affected local government is involved): two (2) appointed by "the Initiator"; two (2) appointed by "the Affected", and one (1) who must be a certified AICP planning professional or a professional from the DCA mediator list approved by both "the Initiator" and "the Affected". If more than one (1) municipality qualifies as an "Affected Local Government" each "Affected" may appoint two (2) members. The Board of Annexation Appeals must be appointed no later than fifteen (15) business days after "the Initiator" and "the Affected" have failed to agree on mitigative measures. Members of the Board of Annexation Appeals may not be an elected official or staff member of the respective governing authorities that are party to this resolution process.
All cost associated with the work of the Board of Annexation Appeals shall be equally borne by the "the Initiator" and "the Affected(s)".
7)
Board decision. Within ten (10) business days of appointment, the Board of Annexation Appeals shall render its decision, which shall be in the form of one following alternative:
a.
Approve the annexation based on the land use classification proposed.
b.
Deny the annexation based on the land use classification objection.

Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public.
The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent, or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.
3.
Appeals: Appeals to the board maybe taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the building inspector, code enforcement officer, planning director and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the ground thereof. The building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director shall forthwith transmit to the board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Each appeal shall be accompanied by a fee, as determined by the city council and listed in the schedule of fees maintained in the city clerk's office, to defray the cost of processing such appeal, said fee to be paid to the City Clerk of West Point.
4.
Stay of proceedings: An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector, code enforcement officer, or planning director certifies to the board that the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director and on due cause shown.
5.
Hearing on appeal: The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest and decide the same within a reasonable time (not to exceed sixty (60) days). Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
6.
Powers of the board: The board of adjustment shall have the following powers:
(a)
To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director in the enforcement of this ordinance, or any amendments thereto.
(b)
To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this ordinance upon which the board is required to pass under this ordinance. Such special exceptions shall include and be limited to the following:
(1)
Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership at the time of the passage of this ordinance.
(2)
Interpret the provisions of this ordinance where the street layout, actually on the ground, varies from the street layout as shown on the "Official Zoning Plan Map of the City of West Point."
(3)
Permit the reconstruction of a non-conforming building which has been destroyed, or partially destroyed by fire or act of God, where the board shall find some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the non-conforming use.
(4)
Permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which the board finds reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare.
(c)

Such variance maybe granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board that:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography, and the application of this ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship, and such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance.
(2)
The authorization of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or materially increase the congestion in public streets, or increase the public danger of fire and safety, or materially diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of West Point.
7.
Modification of decisions appealed from: In exercising the above mentioned powers, the board by the concurring vote of four (4) members may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the building inspector, code enforcement officer or planning director and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
8.
Appeals from action of the board: Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the governing body of the City of West Point, may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board, otherwise the decision of the board will be final.
