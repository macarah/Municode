(c)
No person, firm or corporation shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the City administrator or his/her designee that such person, partners in the firm, officers and directors of the corporation have not been convicted or plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere, and has been released from parole or probation, to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application.

An applicant's first-time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a City ordinance shall not, by itself, make an applicant ineligible for an alcohol license. Should any applicant, partner, or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, after a license has been granted, be convicted or plead guilty or nolo contendere to a crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexually related crime, the license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled.

The City administrator may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as herein set forth for the licensee.
(h)
All licensed establishments must have and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter to be served upon the licensee or owner may be served. This person must be a resident of the county. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written consent of such agent, with the City administrator or his/her designee and shall be in such form as he may prescribe.
(i)
All applicants for any alcoholic beverage license must be of good character, and all operators, managers, clerks, or other employees shall be of like character. Corporate or firm applicants shall be of good business reputation.
(j)
A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license where it appears that the applicant would not have adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the application is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person or persons who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever.
(k)
The City administrator, in his discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If, in his judgment, circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.
(l)
For purposes of this section, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (Ga. Laws 1968, p. 324), as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.

The only entrance or exit from this type of area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit (not for general public use unless a public safety emergency exists). The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.
(e)
In the event that a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the City administrator or his/her designee. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the county's development and fire codes.
(f)
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption-on-the-premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel, provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel.

Sec. 4-41. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited.
(a)
Preamble and purpose.
(1)
Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; which experiences the mayor and council believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the mayor and council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
(2)
Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment," or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity.
(b)
Prohibited. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting, or engaging in, the following activities:
(1)
The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals;
(2)
Live entertainment which provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing, or the performance of obscene acts or acts which simulate:
a.
Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law;
b.
The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or
c.
The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals;
(3)
The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (b)(2) of this section which are obscene under state law; or
(4)
The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct.
(c)
Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall, or is intended to, apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or the like where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or mainstream activity of such establishment.
