The words and phrases, below, shall have the following meanings, except when context clearly indicates a different definition:
City means the City of McDonough, Georgia.
City Official or Official, unless otherwise expressly defined, does not include City employees, but does mean the Mayor, members of the City Council, City of McDonough Municipal Court judges (including substitute judges), the City Administrator, the City Clerk, the City Attorney. The term "City Official" also includes all individuals, including any City employees, appointed by the Mayor and/or City Council to City authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can, or may vote; or take formal action; or make official recommendations to the Mayor and City Council. "City Official" does not include members of the McDonough Youth Advisory Council.
