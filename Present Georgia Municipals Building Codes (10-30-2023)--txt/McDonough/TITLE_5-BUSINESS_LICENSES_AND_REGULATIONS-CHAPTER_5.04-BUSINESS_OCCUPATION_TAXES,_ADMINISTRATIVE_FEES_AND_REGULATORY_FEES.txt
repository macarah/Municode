5.04.210 - Occupation Taxes Levied on Business to be Transacted During Current Calendar Year; Filing of Returns Showing Gross Receipts During Preceding Calendar Year; Final Return and Adjustment.
A.
All occupation taxes levied under this Chapter are levied on the amount of business to be transacted during the current calendar year. However, for convenience of both the City and the taxpayer, each person subject to the occupation tax levied in this Chapter shall, on or before the dates hereinafter set forth, file with the Occupation Tax Clerk, the return hereinafter specifically provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payment of the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth herein.
B.
Where a person subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has conducted business for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.
C.
The owner, proprietor, manager, or secretary officer of the business subject to said occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year, or before January 15th, of the current calendar year, file with the Occupation Tax Clerk, on a form furnished by said officer, a signed return setting forth the amount of actual gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year. This return will be used to determine the final tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupation tax for the current year.
D.
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this Chapter, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said person based on the estimate filed pursuant to subsection (A) hereof, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the City on April 15th, of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date.
E.
If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this Chapter, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said person based on the estimate filed pursuant to subsection (A) hereof, the difference in said amount shall be refundable by the City to the taxpayer; or, if said business continues to conduct business in the City during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the City on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the City by said person for the current year.
F.
All persons filing an occupation tax return with the City shall provide the following information:
1.
The legal name of such business and any associated trade names;
2.
The mailing address of such business and the actual physical address of each location of such business in the City, if different than the mailing address;
3.
The sales and use tax identification number assigned to such business by the Georgia Department of Revenues if such business is required to have such number pursuant to Official Code of Georgia Annotated Title 48, Chapter 8, Article I.
4.
The NAICS Code number(s) applicable to such business.
5.
Any other information required by the Occupation Tax Clerk to insure compliance with the Rules and Regulations of the Georgia Department of Revenues related to the enforcement and administration of O.C.G.A. 48-13-20.1

5.04.250 - Returns Confidential and Inspection of Records.
A.
Except in the case of judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax hereby levied, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee or agent of the City, or any other person to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross receipts or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any occupation tax return required under this Chapter. All contents of said return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, and those tasked with the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the City shall be classed as "employees." Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the publication by City officials of statistics, so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof; or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax departments of the State of Georgia, the United States, and other local governments. Violation of this section shall be unlawful and upon conviction shall be punished as a misdemeanor.
B.
Inspections of Books and Records. In any case the Occupation Tax Clerk of the City, through his/her officers, agents, employees, or representatives, may inspect the books of the business or profession for which the returns are made. The Occupation Tax Clerk shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business or profession of which the return was made in the City, and upon demand of the Occupation Tax Clerk, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the City within 30 days. Failure to submit such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax certificate. In the case of practitioners of professions and occupations, the City shall be sensitive to the issues of client or customer confidentiality. In such cases, the practitioner may redact information claimed to be privileged before disclosing books or records of financial transactions. If such practitioner alleges that redaction provides inadequate protection to the confidences of its clients or customers, such practitioner may petition the Superior Court of Henry County for an in camera inspection, prior to examination by the Tax Clerk. Except for practitioners of professions and occupations electing to pay a flat fee in lieu of a gross receipts tax, adequate records shall be kept in the City, for examination by the Occupation Tax Clerk at that officer's discretion. If after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under reporting, interest in the amount of 1½ percent per month in addition to a ten percent penalty shall be assessed on all delinquent amounts for the period of any delinquency.
