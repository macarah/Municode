The Final Plat shall conform to the approved preliminary plat on file with the City and shall comply with the McDonough Zoning Ordinance including conditions of zoning.
B.
When the Final Plat has been reviewed and received a recommendation for approval by the Community Development Department, the developer shall supply four (4) 17" X 22" original drawings of the Final Plat to the Community Development Department for submission to the Planning Commission. The plat(s) shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor. In addition, all other necessary documentation for recording must be submitted at this time. The Planning Commission shall approve a Final Plat if the Final Plat substantially complies with the preliminary plat. If the Final Plat is denied, the Planning Commission shall state the part(s) of the Final Plat that are not in substantial compliance with the preliminary plat. If final approval is given by the Planning Commission, the Chairman of the Planning Commission will sign the Final Plat indicating such approval.
C.
The developer shall be responsible for properly recording the Final Plat with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Henry County. Three (3) copies will be returned to the developer for filing. Once the final plat has been recorded and stamped by the Superior Court of Henry County, 24 stamped copies shall be submitted to the Community Development Department for distribution.
D.
The procedure for review and recommendation of a Final Plat by the Community Development Department director shall consist of the following steps:
1.
After completion of the physical development of the subdivision, the developer shall contact the Community Development Department for a checklist specifying the procedure in obtaining the various approvals from City departments which will release the subdivision for Final Plat consideration.
2.
As part of this process, the developer shall submit a proposed Final Plat and as-built drawings, along with performance guarantees as discussed below. The Security, in the amount as shown on the current fee schedule, shall name the City of McDonough through the Community Development Department as obligee. The maintenance Security shall remain in effect for three (3) years from the date of Final Plat approval. During the three-year period, it shall be the developer's responsibility to repair any defects that occur in the streets, water and sewer lines, sidewalks, drainage systems, and stormwater detention systems. In the event of the failure of the owner/developer to perform this duty, the city may call upon the security to complete repair or replacement as necessary.
3.
The Security may be released at the end of the three-year period. Ninety (90) days prior to expiration, a final inspection by the public works department of all subdivision improvements should be performed to determine the need for any repairs. If repairs are necessary, the Community Development Department will notify the developer in writing.
4.
If the developer fails to take the necessary action to make repairs within thirty (30) calendar days of notification by the City, then the Community Development Department Director will authorize the surety or bank issuing the bond to release to the City all or any amount of the funds needed to make repairs. If Security has been provided by a cash deposit, upon the same notice to the developer, and upon the same failure to act, the city may call upon the cash deposit for any amount of funds needed to make repairs. Upon release of the funds, the Community Development Department Director will take action to ensure that the necessary repairs to streets, sidewalks, drainage, or stormwater detention facilities are completed.
5.
The Community Development Department Director may require the Security to be extended to ensure the completion of repairs started but not completed by the developer for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) calendar days.
