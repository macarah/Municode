CHAPTER 18.09 - WETLAND PROTECTION

Sections:
18.09.010 - Findings and Purpose.
A.
Wetlands within the City of McDonough, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic wellbeing of many communities within the state of Georgia.
B.
The purpose of this Chapter is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this Chapter is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, and aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.

18.09.020 - Definitions.
City. —City of McDonough, Georgia.
County. —Henry County, Georgia.
Functions. — The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities.
Generalized Wetland Map. — A map showing the general locations of wetlands within the jurisdiction of the City of McDonough.
Hydric Soils. — Soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. The Soil Conservation Service maintains a list of these soils.
Hydrophytic vegetation. — Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional Determination. — An official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
Jurisdictional Wetland. — A wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.
Temporary Emergency Permit. — A temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in Section 15.60.050.
Wetland. — An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
Wetland Delineation. — The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps.
Wetland Protection District. — All wetlands within the jurisdiction of the City of McDonough and shown on the Generalized Wetland Map.
Regulated Activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
The definitions set forth in the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Manual shall apply for terms which are not defined within this Chapter.
(Ord. No. 10-09-20(C), § I, 9-20-2010)
18.09.030 - Wetland protection district.
A.
This Chapter shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the City of McDonough, Georgia. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this Title, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached hereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the community development department.
B.
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/ landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. 10-09-20(C), § I, 9-20-2010)
18.09.040 - Permissible Uses (Uses as of Right).

18.09.050 - Local Development Permits.
A.
No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the Community Development Director in the form of a Land Development Permit. Issuance of a Land Development Permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and other applicable regulations. If the area proposed for development is located within twenty-five (25) feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the Community Development Director or authorized local government representative using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a Land Development Permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.
B.
Prior to issuance of any development permit for activity within twenty-five (25) feet of a wetland, the applicant must include with the site plans for the proposed action documentation that the following post-development conditions will prevail at the site:
1.
The rate of stormwater runoff, volume of stormwater runoff, and peak runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development levels.
2.
The amount of the following pollutants carried within runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development conditions: (1) phosphorus; (2) nitrogen; (3) zinc; (4) lead. In addition, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and turbidity (TSS) shall not exceed pre-development levels.
C.
Temporary Emergency Permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the Community Development Director for the following reasons:
1.
Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the Community Development Director and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
2.
Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
3.
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of Section 15.60.040.
4.
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.

18.09.090 - Subdivision Design Options in the Wetland Protection District.
A.
Any subdivision that includes Jurisdictional Wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options:
1.
Lot Size Averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The Zoning Administrator may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The Zoning Administrator shall require no more than a twenty-five (25) percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot.
2.
Cluster Development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the Zoning Administrator will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least (25) percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel of land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular right-of-ways. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.
