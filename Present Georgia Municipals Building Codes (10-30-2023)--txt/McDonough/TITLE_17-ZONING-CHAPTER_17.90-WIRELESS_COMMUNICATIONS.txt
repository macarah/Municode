(Ord. No. 97-06-08, (part))
17.90.030 - Applicability.
A.
District Height Limitations. The requirements set forth in this Chapter shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to building and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas.
B.
Public Property. Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property and used for public purposes, leased, or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the requirements of this Chapter, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority.
C.
Amateur Radio—Receive-Only Antennas. This Chapter shall not govern any amateur radio tower, or the installment of any antenna, that is under seventy (70) feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
D.
Pre-Existing Grandfathered Towers and Antennas. Any tower or antenna existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter shall not be required to meet the requirements of this Chapter, other than the requirements of section 17.90.040E and F. Any such tower or antennas shall be referred to in this Chapter as "pre-existing towers" or "pre-existing antennas."
(Ord. No. 97-06-08, (part))
17.90.040 - General guidelines.
A.
Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
B.
Inventory of Existing or Planned Tower Sites.
1.
Each applicant for a tower or antenna shall contact the owners of all existing tower sites or planned tower sites approved after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter, that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, and provide the planning and zoning department with an inventory of said tower sites. The inventory should include the following information:
a.
The owner and/or lessee of the tower site;
b.
The location, height, and design of the tower site;
c.
Whether each such tower site could accommodate the tower proposed by the applicant without changing the existing or proposed structure; or
d.
Whether each such tower site could accommodate the tower proposed by the applicant if either or both the existing or proposed tower was structurally or otherwise changed. Any changes shall be specified in general terms.
2.
The planning and zoning department may share such information with other applicants applying for approval under this Chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the planning and zoning department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting the accuracy of said information or that such sites are available or suitable.
C.
Site Plan. Applicants requesting approval shall submit a scaled site plan, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, access, existing and proposed utilities, parking, fencing, landscaping, and other information necessary to assess compliance with this Chapter. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
D.
Aesthetics—Lighting. The following guidelines shall govern the aesthetics and lighting of all towers, and the installment of all antennas.
1.
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
3.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
4.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
E.
Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall result in enforcement action pursuant to Chapter 17.92.
F.
Building Codes—Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in the City's building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have sixty (60) days to bring such tower into compliance. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance with such standards appropriate action will be taken by the community development director.
(Ord. No. 97-06-08, (part))
17.90.050 - Development requirements.
A.
Communication towers, tower facilities and antennas subject to regulation by this Chapter shall only be allowed in the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts.
B.
Setbacks.
1.
All tower facilities shall be set back from all adjoining properties zoned residential a distance equal to the height of the tower or two hundred (200) feet, whichever is greater.
2.
All tower facilities shall be set back from all adjoining properties zoned nonresidential a distance equal to the height of the tower or one hundred (100) feet, whichever is greater.
C.
All anchors shall be set back within the requirements of the zoning district.
D.
Towers over seventy (70) feet in height shall not be located within one and one-half miles from any existing tower that is over seventy (70) feet in height.
E.
Security Fencing. Towers and all facilities shall be enclosed by a wood fence or steel chain link fence with inserts for screening not less than eight feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device.
F.
Landscaping. In addition to the requirements of the City landscape ordinance, the following guidelines shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers; provided:
1.
The tower and related facilities shall be landscaped with a standard buffer that shall consist of a landscaped strip ten feet in width surrounding the perimeter of the compound. Buffer shall be six feet in height at time of planting.
2.
Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
(Ord. No. 97-06-08, (part))
17.90.060 - Public hearing required.
A.
General. All new tower construction and any additions to existing towers shall require a public hearing and approval by the planning and zoning commission. All such uses shall comply with sections 17.90.040 and 17.90.050 of this Chapter and all other applicable ordinances. Applicants shall apply for a public hearing through the planning department.
In granting an approval, the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent the planning and zoning commission concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties.
B.
Availability of Suitable Existing Towers or Other Structures for Co-location. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing or planned tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antennas (see section 17.90.020). This inventory should also include the following supplemental information:
1.
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
2.
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
3.
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
4.
Applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures.
5.
The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable.
6.
Applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(Ord. No. 97-06-08, (part))
17.90.070 - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the community development director shall take appropriate action to effect the removal of the tower. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.
