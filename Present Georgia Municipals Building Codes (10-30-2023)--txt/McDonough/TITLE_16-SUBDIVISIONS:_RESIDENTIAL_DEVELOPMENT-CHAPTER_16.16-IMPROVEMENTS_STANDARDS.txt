(Ord. No. 04-12-06-A, § I, 12-6-2004; Ord. No. 06-05-01(A), § 61, 5-1-2006)
16.16.240 - Construction requirements for residential subdivisions streets.
A.
Compliance. The design and construction requirements for residential subdivisions shall comply with the minimum standards shown in Table 16.1.
B.
Grading permit—Issuance and scope. After a pre-construction conference has been held, the community development department director duly notified, and all required silt and erosion control measures installed and approved, the developer may obtain a grading permit to clear and grade the areas designated for roads, rights-of-way, sewer easements, and stormwater facilities. The community development department director may also allow the clearing and grading of additional areas subject to the following criteria:
1.
The topography of the site requires removal and fill operations to meet the street or grade elevations or the additional grading is necessary to protect state waters or surrounding property.
2.
Any areas graded outside of the rights-of-way shall be either be covered with seed and straw within ten calendar days of land disturbance.
3.
The community development department director may require additional soil and erosion control measures to be installed prior to any grading outside of the areas designated for roads, rights-of-way, sewer easements, and stormwater facilities.
C.
Grading. The grading, base and pavement for residential street construction shall be as follows:
1.
Elevation. All streets shall be graded to the elevations shown on the approved construction plans.
2.
Buffer. A minimum of a 30-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained on all property lines prior to approval of the final plat.
3.
Rubbish. No rubbish or other material resulting from the clearing of the roadway may be buried within the construction limits of the roadway or detention ponds. If burning is permitted, all burn pits must be located outside of the roadway construction limits.
4.
Excavation. All grading operations shall be planned and executed by the contractor in such a manner as to provide suitable subgrade material in the top 12 inches of the roadway. In areas where the material in place is not suitable for subgrades, these areas shall be undercut a minimum of 12 inches and back filled with suitable material. All rock and boulders in the roadbed shall be excavated to a depth of at least 12 inches below the subgrade and the space back filled to the correct grade with suitable material. Any stones, broken rock, or boulders resulting from the grading of the roadway may not be placed in any roadway fill area except when approved by the community development department director and then under his supervision.
5.
Placement of fill. Fill construction shall not begin until all clearing and grubbing of the fill area has been completed. All depressions in the ground shall be filled level with the adjacent surface using suitable material and compacted to the approximate density of the surrounding soil before placement of the fill is begun. The entire area upon which fill is to be placed shall be plowed, scarified, and finely broken up to a depth of a minimum of six inches. Before the placement of fill material is begun, all loosened soil shall be compacted the approximate density of the underlying soil. Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted a minimum 12 inches deep to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative samples of the material being compacted. In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exists, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the full width of the fill area, to an underlying stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to the approximate density of the underlying material. All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment. Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted. Fills shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density to within the top 12 inches of the fill. The top 12 inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density. The entire roadbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers. While the work is in progress, contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills, subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface.
6.
The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor patrol grader with adequate power to blade and maintain the roadbed. Suitable scarifiers shall also be available for use whenever necessary.
D.
Development permit. After the developer has completed all of the grading pursuant to the grading permit and site has been inspected by the community development department, the community development department director may issue a development permit for the installation of streets, curbs, gutters, and utilities subject to the following requirements:
1.
Final finishing of roadway. After all excavation has been completed and all fills have been placed, the entire road bed surface shall be finally shaped with a grading machine supplemented with hand work whenever required, to secure a smooth surface and uniform cross-section. Slopes of cuts and fills shall also be carefully shaped to the true section specified. When final shaping is finished, the road surface shall conform accurately to the line, grade and cross section shown of plans, and no roots, sod, grass, stones, or other unsuitable material shall remain in the top 12 inches of the finished road bed. All ditches and drains shall be opened to effectively drain the roadway. During the construction of the roadway on a day-to-day basis, the roadbed edges shall be kept lower than the center and the grading shall be done so that the surfaces of the excavated areas and fill will be kept reasonably smooth and well drained. Adequate surface ditches shall be cut at the tops of cut slopes, extending to each end of the cuts in order to carry the water from the side hill. Side ditches or gutters emptying from cuts to fill areas shall be turned outward so as to prevent erosion of the fill slopes.
2.
Placement of curb and gutter. After sanitary sewer and water lines have been installed, all storm drainage in place, and the final finishing of the roadway has been approved by the community development department director, the installation of the concrete curb and gutter may begin. All concrete curb and gutter shall be in accordance with McDonough construction standards. Any curb and gutter which does not conform to a true section, texture, line and grade shall be removed and replaced as directed by the development inspector.
3.
Subgrade. Before placing any pavement base the entire surface of the subgrade shall be plowed, harrowed, and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. If a subgrade stabilization material is required it shall be incorporated into the subgrade at this time. After the material has been thoroughly mixed the subgrade shall be brought into a proper line and grade and compacted to 100 percent of maximum dry density just prior to placing the base material. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of one-half inch. The acceptance crown tolerance shall be one-half inch.
4.
Base construction. The community development department director shall be notified 24 hours prior to the placing of any base material. After the inspector is satisfied all the equipment necessary for the proper construction of road base is on the project and the subgrade has been brought to the proper line, grade and crown, and compacted to the required density he may authorize the placing of the base material. After the base material has been placed and compacted to the required density the inspector will check the completed base course. All areas found to be deficient shall be marked and corrected before any asphalt pavement is placed. Areas where the crown is found to exceed that which is specified or the exposed edge of the concrete gutter is less than the minimum depth required, shall be reshaped and rolled to obtain the required cross-section. After the compacted material has been approved, cores shall be taken as directed by the development inspector to determine the thickness of the constructed base course. Areas found to be deficient in thickness shall be corrected as directed by the development inspector. A copy of all delivery tickets for the graded aggregate base material shall be furnished prior to placing any asphaltic concrete paving material. A shortage in the base material used shall require that the asphaltic concrete surface course thickness be increased. All work and materials shall be in accordance with the pertinent "Graded Aggregate Construction" sections of the "Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications," latest edition.
5.
Paving. After the road base has been accepted by the development inspector and upon his approval the contractor shall begin the construction of the asphaltic concrete pavement. All asphaltic concrete material and construction shall be in accordance with the "hot mix asphaltic concrete construction" sections of the "Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications", latest edition. After the material has been placed and rolled to the satisfaction of the inspector, he shall check the cross section of the finished pavement. Any area found to be deficient shall be marked and a record of deficiencies made by the development inspector.
6.
If, in the opinion of the community development department director, the extent of deficiencies will impair the performance of the pavement, he shall direct that an overlay of a minimum thickness of one inch be placed before the roadway is opened to traffic. A copy of the delivery tickets for the asphaltic concrete material used shall be furnished to the development inspector at the time of completion of the work. If the delivery tickets indicate a shortage in the material used from the quantity estimated the development inspector may require a minimum one-inch overlay of the streets.
7.
Upon acceptance of the surface course by the community development department director, the developer shall have core tests made as directed by the city, to verify the thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement. If these indicate a deficiency in thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement an overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur:
a.
When the number of cores deficient in thickness within the allowable one-quarter of an inch tolerance exceeds 35 percent of the total cores taken on one street.
b.
When two or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one-quarter of an inch allowable tolerance. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance additional cores will be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness.
c.
Any required overlay shall extend a minimum of 150 feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be saw cut normal to the roadway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement for a minimum of ten feet at each end of the overlay. The thickness of the overlay shall be determined by the depth of the deficient area and shall not be less than one inch in compacted thickness. The type of material used in the overlay shall be specified by the city.
d.
After the paving has been inspected and approved, the pavement edges or behind the curb and gutter shall be back filled and compacted and the ditches and back slopes properly graded, shaped, seeded and mulched. An 80 percent stand of grass must be obtained. All swales and ditches excavated below required depth shall be back filled and compacted to 95 percent of maximum dry density.
