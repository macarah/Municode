(e)
Each interceptor shall be prefabricated or field fabricated and have at a minimum one baffle that shall extend the full width of the interceptor, extending from the bottom to within six inches of the top. The baffle shall have an inverted long radius elbow fitting or other approved means equivalent in size to the inlet piping but in no case less than four inches in size installed in the inlet compartment side of the baffle with the fitting placed 12 inches above the bottom of the interceptor. Minimum depth of the liquid shall be 42 inches. There shall be a minimum of two manholes with covers that are gas-tight in construction having a minimum opening of 18 inches in diameter (one over the inlet and one over the outlet) to provide access for cleaning and inspection of all fixtures and compartments of the grease interceptor. The grease interceptor shall be located at least 25 feet from the last appliance connected to the grease line within the building. In parking areas, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate reinforcement and cover (including piping) meeting HS-20 traffic loading specifications. Grease interceptors in parking areas require concrete driving surface over piping with structural backfill around piping.
(f)
The inlet and outlet piping shall have a two-way cleanout tee installed and leveled. The tee and pipe shall be no less than four inches in diameter. The tee shall be installed with the run in the vertical orientation. Inlet piping shall enter at two-and-one-half inches above the invert of the outlet piping. Inlet piping shall extend to 24 inches below the water level of the interceptor. The outlet pipe shall extend to 36 inches below the water level of the interceptor.
(g)
Each grease interceptor shall be vented where subject to a loss of trap seal. The grease interceptor shall be designed so that it will not become air bound if a closed cover is used. The grease interceptor and discharge line shall each be vented, and the vents shall not be tied together less than 42 inches above the tank lid elevation.

If multiple grease interceptors are installed, all traps in the series must be pumped. The pumping of grease interceptors shall occur with a minimum frequency of every 90 days or more frequently when;
(1)
Twenty-five percent or more of the wetted height of the grease interceptor, as measured from the bottom of the device to the invert of the outlet pipe contains floating materials, sediment, food particles, or FOG;

If approved by the CZA and PWD for the installation of a hydro-mechanical grease interceptor, Table 2 shall be used to size the unit. This table shows the standard formulas for sizing grease interceptors to meet requirements of specific fixtures in an ordered fashion, an includes an example of their use. Table 3 provides the standard sizes for hydro-mechanical grease interceptors.
Table 2

Hydro-Mechanical Grease Interceptor Sizing
Step Step/Formula Example
#1 Determine volume of fixture
Length × Width × Depth 48" long by 24" wide by 12" deep sink
48" × 24" ×12" = 13,824 cubic inches
#2 Determine capacity in gallons
1 gallon - 231 cubic inches 13824 cubic inches/231 cubic inches per gallon = 59.8 gallons
#3 Determine actual drainage load
(Fixtures typically 75% full, tems inside displace volume)
Capacity × 75% = Actual Drainage Load Actual Drainage Load = 0.75 × 59.8 gallons = 44.9 gallons
#4 Determine flow rate for drain time
(Use 1-minute drain time)
Flow Rate = Actual Drainage Load/Drain Time Flow Rate = 44.9 gallons / 1 minute = 44.9 GPM
#5 Select standard interceptor size
(If between sizes, select larger unit)
Use Table 3 below From Table 3:
35 GPM < 44.9 GPM < 50 GPM
