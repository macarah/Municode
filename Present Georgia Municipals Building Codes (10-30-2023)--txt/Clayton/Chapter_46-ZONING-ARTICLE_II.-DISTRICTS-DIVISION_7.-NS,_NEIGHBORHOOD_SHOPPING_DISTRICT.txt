DIVISION 7. - NS, NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING DISTRICT

Sec. 46-235. - Purpose and intent.
The NS neighborhood shopping district is intended to provide areas for limited small-scale commercial uses of a convenience nature serving nearby residential neighborhoods as opposed to a regional market. The district is not intended to accommodate automotive or other types of more intensive commercial activities that are of such magnitude or type that would result in the generation of excessive traffic, noise, odors, pollution, safety hazards, or other adverse impacts which would detract from the desirability of adjacent properties for residential use. In general, the neighborhood shopping district includes offices and retail and service establishments but excludes those highway-oriented uses which involve use of chemicals and outside sales, storage or display.
