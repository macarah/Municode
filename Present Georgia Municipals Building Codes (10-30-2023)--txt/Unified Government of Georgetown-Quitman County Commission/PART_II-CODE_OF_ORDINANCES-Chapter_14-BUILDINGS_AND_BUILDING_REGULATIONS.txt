However, no removal or demolition of any dwelling, building or structure shall be ordered except upon a finding that the cost of repair, alteration or improvement exceeds one-half of the value of the subject dwelling, structure or property.
(c)
If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to vacate and close or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, or correct conditions on private property constituting a health hazard on private property, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, structure or property to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed, or demolished and may cause to be posted a notice on the main entrance of any such building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words:
