ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURES FOR PLAT APPROVAL

Sec. 19-21. - Prior considerations.
Prior to initial application for development of a proposed subdivision within the City of Thomson, consideration should be given to the major issues and requirements which will impact the design and development of the subdivision and the resulting cost of construction. Such issues include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Suitability of land. Land which is deemed by the planning commission to be unsuitable for development will be denied for development, or, the developer will be required to initiate or incorporate mitigating measures to render the land suitable for development. Land considered as unsuitable for development includes, but is not limited to:
a.
Flooding. Land subject to flooding, deemed by observation to be located in floodplains, and land designated as floodprone.
b.
Wetlands. Land which is designated as wetlands by existing map resources or identified on-site by a qualified consultant.
c.
Poor drainage. Land which is considered unsuitable due to poor drainage.
d.
Geologic/topographic conditions. Land which posses rock formations or outcroppings, and land having steep slopes, or land which may endanger health, life, or property. Land development which may aggravate erosion, increase flood hazard, or necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for supply and maintenance of services.
e.
Predetermined unsuitable. Land which other public agencies have investigated and found, in the best interest of the public, not suitable for the type of platting and development proposed. Such lands shall not be approved for subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by subdivision of such land.
f.
General. Land which is considered unsuitable due to scattered or premature subdivision of land which would endanger health, safety or property because of lack of, or adverse effect on the water supply, schools, proper drainage, transportation, other public services, or public funds for the supply or maintenance of such services.
(2)
Design costs. Developers with little or no prior experience in subdivision development will encounter significant engineering and surveying cost and time relating to the design, submittal, and applicable resubmittal of subdivision design plans.
(3)
Land/improvements. Developers will encounter significant costs in acquiring the land for the subdivision, designing the subdivision to city design requirements, the purchase and installation of the subdivision infrastructure and improvements including paved streets, drainage facilities such as drop inlets, stormwater piping and detention basins; sidewalks, municipal water and sewer, underground electric service, street lights, green spaces/greenways, recreation areas, landscaping, etc.
(4)
Compliance fees. Developers will experience associated cost and time in complying with pertinent federal, state, and local regulations such as wetland mitigation, city design review and fees, state erosion and sediment control (E&S) review and fees, state/federal NPDES fees.
(5)
Responsibility of costs. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or developer to underwrite the total cost of the construction of the subdivision development. The furnishing of performance bonding to gain early release of lots for sale, or other transfer of title, is prohibited.
( Ord. No. 546, 6-10-10 )
Sec. 19-22. - Preliminary consultation.
Prior to the submittal of any preliminary development plat, all subdividers or developers are required to meet with the director of the planning commission, city director of public works, and other applicable representatives to review the city's requirements for development. The subdivider/developer should submit a draft scaled sketch of the proposed subdivision along with data showing existing conditions within the site and its vicinity. It is not necessary or recommended that developers produce engineered plans at this time. No fee shall be charged for this informal consultation, and no formal application is anticipated. The informal consultation will cover the development and design requirements and issues applicable to their development. After consultation and upon approval by the planning commission, the owner/developer may draft and submit a preliminary plat as described below.
( Ord. No. 546, 6-10-10 )
Sec. 19-23. - Submittal of preliminary plat.
(a)
Plat requirements and improvements. Prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat the subdivider/developer should first reference and become familiar with the zoning requirements for development which is found in the City of Thomson zoning ordinance for the zoning district in which the property is to be developed. The subdivider/developer is required to comply with those plat requirements noted herein which must be incorporated into the subdivision plans.
(b)
Plan submittal. The subdivider/developer shall submit to the planning commission preliminary plat sets, the number of which shall be determined by the planning commission, along with a subdivision review fee in an amount as approved by the city council. The submittal of a preliminary plat to the planning commission for review neither constitutes an application for board review, nor conveys developmental rights to the subdivider/developer which are conveyed only upon approval of the preliminary plat by the city council.
(c)
Plan review. At such time as the owner or developer submits to the planning commission a preliminary plat and any additional documentation as is required by the planning commission, and upon receipt of all applicable fees, the staff shall review the preliminary plat for conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The planning commission shall not accept a preliminary subdivision plan application for board review unless, in their judgment, it is found to comply with all applicable required plan elements and required subdivision improvements. The developer should note that the review of the preliminary plat by the planning commission does not include or cover the state's review undertaken by the local NRCS office for erosion and sedimentation control. Upon completion of the planning commission and city review, staff shall inform the developer of the results of the review and any subsequent actions necessary to bring the plat into conformity with the requirements of this chapter. Only at such time as the preliminary plat is reviewed and approved by the planning commission staff will the plat be eligible for presentation to the planning commission board, and city council thereafter.
(d)
Application to planning commission board.
(1)
Application without variance request(s). After review by the planning commission, should the preliminary plat be found to be in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter, without the necessity or intent of application by the developer for the granting of a variance from the provisions of this chapter, the review of the preliminary plat by the planning commission board shall neither be necessary nor required. The preliminary plat shall be forwarded by the planning commission directly to the city council for review.
(2)
Application with variance request(s). After review by the planning commission, should the preliminary plat fail to be in full compliance with the provisions with this chapter, and it is the intent of the developer to apply for variances from the provisions of this chapter, the developer shall submit a "variance plat" which shall clearly indicate any variances or deviations which are being sought by the developer. After staff review of the variance plat the subdivider/developer will be directed to submit an application for preliminary plat review before the planning commission board, and thereafter to the city council. Such application shall be made by such date as is designated as the application cut-off date for such board review.
[Advertising] Applications for variances from the subdivision regulations shall require a public notice which shall be advertised in the local newspaper of general circulation not less than 15 days prior to such review. Unless otherwise determined by the planning commission, notice by on-site signage shall not be required. Developers should contact the planning commission for guidance on the characteristics, design, and makeup of the "variance plat" sheet(s) which indicate the variances applied for.
(e)
Planning commission board action (variance plat). The board shall review the application and thereafter recommend approval of the preliminary plat, with or without conditions, or denial of the preliminary plat. The board shall, in addition, have the opportunity of postponing their decision for a period not greater than 62 days. If action on a preliminary or variance plat(s) is not taken by the planning commission board within 62 days from the date of the first hearing, the planning commission shall be considered as having taken "no action" whereupon the preliminary plat shall thereafter be forwarded to the city council for review. In addition to the 62 days, additional time may be granted for review of the plats if agreed upon by the applicant. The final action or recommendation of the planning commission board shall be conveyed to the city clerk who shall then place the subdivision plat on the agenda for review by the city council.
(f)
City council action. The city council upon review of the preliminary or variance plat shall consider the recommendation of the planning commission board and any additional comments or information regarding the application, and shall render a final declaration as to the approval, with or without conditions, or denial of the plat. The city council shall, in addition, have the opportunity to postpone their decision for a period not to exceed 93 days. If, however, final action is not taken by the council within 93 days of the date of the first hearing before the city council, the preliminary plat shall be considered as approved. In addition to the 93 days, additional time for review may be granted if agreed upon by the applicant. Approval of the preliminary plat by the city council shall constitute authorization for the subdivider to begin construction of the subdivision in accordance with the approved preliminary plat. Any deviation from the approved plan which is found during construction, or prior to the approval of the final or as built plat shall immediately be addressed by appropriate corrective action and approved by the planning commission or city council. The subdivider, subdivision owner, or agent shall not transfer, sell, or negotiate to sell any lots, areas, or phases of the subdivision, by reference or exhibition, except upon approval of the final or as built plat. Should the subdivision plat not be approved, the planning commission staff shall notify the applicant setting forth the reasons for such denial.
(g)
Post approval actions.
(1)
Preliminary plat status change. It shall be understood by the owner/developer that, upon approval of a preliminary plat, time is of the essence. Upon approval it is incumbent upon the subdivider/developer to begin development and construction of the subdivision in an expeditious manner. If it is determined by the planning commission that continuous development activity on or within the subdivision, or of a subdivision phase, has ceased, or is otherwise in a state of inactivity for a period of six months, the planning commission is hereby authorized to declare the status of the construction of the subdivision, and therefore the subdivision plat, as "inactive." Should a subdivision receive the status of "inactive," the developer shall be notified by standard post at his/her last known address of record that the preliminary plat approval and all development permits and approvals shall be considered as suspended until such time as the developer or subdivider shall apply for a "reactivated" status. The criteria and procedure for reactivation shall be determined by the planning commission.
(2)
Reactivation and conformity. Prior to such time as the owner or developer shall apply for the status of "active" or "reactivated," the preliminary plat, and therefore the project addressed by said plat may be subject to being brought into conformity with any current standards of planning, construction, or engineered design at such time as the project and plat is considered for reactivation.
(3)
Exemption (grandfathered plats). Subdivision preliminary plats which have received approval from the city council prior to the adoption of this chapter and have been substationally (i.e., ≥90 percent) built out or have remained "active" as set forth in subsection (g)(1) above shall be considered as "grandfathered" and shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter.

ARTICLE III. - GENERAL STANDARDS OF DESIGN

Sec. 19-31. - Name designations.
(a)
Name of subdivision. The name of each subdivision must have the approval of the planning commission. The subdivision name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision.
(b)
Street names. Street names shall not duplicate existing street names irrespective of the use of the suffixes such as street, avenue, boulevard, street, pike, drive, way, trail, place, court, or other derivatives which shall be approved by the planning commission. The planning commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication and in coordinating the names of streets. Approved street signs shall be placed at all intersections. Proposed streets which are continuations of, or are in alignment with, existing streets shall bear the names of existing streets. Streets whose intersection or "curves" approximate a right angle (90 o ) may, as directed by the planning commission, be required to be assigned a different name.
( Ord. No. 546, 6-10-10 )
Sec. 19-32. - Street classification.
Streets are classified in relation to the transportation function which they are to serve including the type, speed, and volume of traffic they will carry, and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets as used in this chapter shall be as follows:
Classification by traffic volume:
• Primary Arteries (Arterial)—State and federal highways and those city streets which by design, traffic volume, and speed (55+ mph), or are specifically designated as a primary artery by the planning commission.
• Secondary Artery—City streets which are by traffic volume and speed (45-55 mph) are designated as such by the planning commission.
• Collector Streets—Streets as designated by the planning commission as having a lower traffic volume than arterial streets, and having a lower required speed (25-45 mph) and serve to facilitate the movement of traffic between land service streets and arterial streets.
• Land Service Streets—Streets which facilitate the movement of traffic directly from land lots to collector streets, and which require the lowest traffic speed (15-25 mph).
Classification by use: (See section 19-34.)
(1)
Residential:
a.
Large lot subdivisions (Zone TR-1) (Lots ≥ 15,000 sq. ft., with min. frontage of 100′)
b.
Medium lot subdivisions (Zone TR-2) (Lots ≥ 10,000 sq. ft., with min. frontage of 75′)

Sec. 19-33. - Street system.
(a)
Connection to existing streets. Existing streets that terminate at adjoin, or traverse a proposed subdivision shall meet or exceed all requirements of this article prior to, or as a result of, approval of the preliminary plat. Public streets providing access to the subdivision shall be paved from the nearest paved street of the public street system to each subdivision entrance. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, developer, or subdivider to pave such streets.
(b)
Layout of new streets. The proposed street system within a subdivision shall be determined by the planning commission to adequately balance the privacy of the future occupants with the free flow of traffic within the city, and to adequately provide for access for public safety by fire, police, and emergency medical vehicles, and for school buses. In making such determination, satisfaction of the following requirements shall be considered by the planning commission:
(1)
In the opinion of the planning commission, where it is necessary to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication and improvement of right-of-way to the boundary of such property.
(2)
Unless approved otherwise by the planning commission, a subdivision shall provide a street connection to each public street that it adjoins, and shall provide direct or indirect continuity through the subdivision between each connection.
(3)
The proposed street layout should be designed to minimize cut and fill within the right-of-way to provide better access to the subdivision lots. The design should also minimize the area of tree removal required for installation of streets, utilities and drainage features in order to reduce the number of large trees removed during construction.
(c)
Interval of intersection with arteries. Subdivision streets which intersect a city arterial street shall do so at intervals not less than the following:
(1)
Primary artery, 1,000 feet;
(2)
Secondary artery, 600 feet.
(d)
Large parcels. When land is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels should be arranged so as to allow for the opening of streets in the future.

(c)
Street development. Every subdivision lot or parcel shall have access to a street system which shall be designated and engineered according to the design criteria contained in article III herein, and such criteria referenced below.
(1)
Preparation of right-of-way. The full width of all streets shall be prepared so that pavement, sidewalks, and other required improvements may be constructed in such a manner that future extension of additional utilities or street improvements will not damage yards of abutting property. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line. Due regard shall be shown for desirable trees not impairing visibility.
(2)
Preparation of subgrade. Before grading is started, the entire area to be paved shall first be cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials. In all areas to be graded or filled, the subdivider shall stockpile the topsoil to be spread later in all disturbed areas not paved.
(3)
Protection of banks. Immediately after grading, filling, and re-spreading of topsoil, all areas of disturbed soil shall be fertilized, seeded, sodded, or otherwise appropriately treated with suitable vegetative cover to retard erosion. The stabilization as evidenced by an adequate stand of grass on all right-of-ways shall be obtained to the satisfaction of the City of Thomson Streets Department before approval of the final plat.
(4)
Street base. Street base material and compaction shall conform to the city's specifications for such, and shall be approved by the City of Thomson.
(5)
Curb-and-gutter and paving (R). All new streets shall be surfaced by the developer with paving materials as required by city specifications regarding street paving and surface materials. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be required on all new streets and shall be constructed by the subdivision developer in accordance with the city's specifications for curbs and gutters. Where a subdivision abuts an existing state highway or city street, the developer shall be required extend the subdivision's street improvements (paved streets, curb/gutter, etc.) out to, and to improve such public street in compliance with the minimum requirements of this chapter.
(6)
New streets (R). The preparation and development of all new streets shall comply with the city's specifications herein, and shall be approved by the city before such streets may be developed and accepted by the city council.
(7)
Turn lanes (R) < (if required). Center turn lanes may be required at entrances into residential, industrial, and commercial developments which front on arterial streets. Turn lanes shall be 12 feet in width for a minimum distance of 200 feet which distance shall be measured from the intersection of the right-of-way lines. Contact the planning commission for analysis of city streets at proposed subdivision entrances and the requirements for turn lanes.
(8)

Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of the streets and shall be four feet in width and four inches in depth. For standard (upright) curb and gutter, the sidewalk may join or abut the back side of the curb. For roll-top curbing, the front (street) edge of the sidewalk shall be placed not closer than five feet from the back side of the curb. Sidewalks shall not be located less than one foot from all front property lines to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges or other plantings or structures placed on the property line at a later date. At street corners and other required locations, sidewalk handicap ramps shall be installed. In addition to interior subdivision sidewalks, sidewalks along exterior roadways or other public right-of-ways shall also be required where deemed by the planning commission as an integral part of a pedestrian traffic system within a one-mile radius of existing or planned schools, neighborhood recreation, or commercial areas, or other public places, and for continuation of existing sidewalks.
(e)
Site improvements. Earthen banks which infringe on sight lines at street intersections shall be appropriately graded to correct the deficiency. Wherever grading or filling occurs on lots within the subdivision, the subdivider shall first stockpile the topsoil from the affected areas and shall immediately, upon conclusion of such grading, re-distribute the topsoil to support growth of lawn grass and other vegetation, and shall immediately seed such areas with appropriate vegetative cover to prevent erosion, silting of streams and other damages. Due regard should be shown for such desirable trees which are already on the site, and grading and filling should be planned to preserve as many of such trees as possible; however, no retained planting shall infringe on sight lines at intersections. If trees are planted by the subdivider, they shall be located five feet inside or behind property lines where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chances of motor accidents and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted within a planting strip in the right-of-way, the proposed locations and species of such trees to be used must be submitted for the planning commission's approval since the public inherits the care and maintenance of such trees.

ARTICLE VI. - DEVELOPMENT ASSURANCES, DEDICATION, VARIANCES

Sec. 19-71. - Assurance of continued maintenance.
To assure the proper installation and maintenance of all subdivision improvements prior to the City of Thomson accepting same, the following requirements shall be met:
(1)
Developer maintenance period. The City of Thomson shall not accept any subdivision streetways, right-of-ways, or other subdivision improvements for a period of not less than 12 months from the date that all subdivision improvements have been initially completed, inspected, and approved as evidenced by approval of the final plat. If approved, the City of Thomson shall notify the owner or developer of same in writing at which time the developer maintenance period shall commence. In addition to the minimum one-year period developer maintenance period requirement, the city may require that 60 percent of the lots within the subdivision, or subdivision phase, have fully constructed residential structures in place prior to consideration of the acceptance or dedication of any subdivision improvements. The developer maintenance period and the 60 percent "built-out" requirement will allow for sufficient time to detect any hidden defects in the subdivision improvements which are not readily identifiable at the time of initial inspection of the improvements, and will assure that all subdivision improvements will be properly maintained. The initial 12-month developer maintenance period may be extended at the option of the city council.
[Bond] The planning commission may require the developer/owner to maintain in force a performance bond securing the installation and approval of such subdivision improvements.
(2)
Maintenance assurance. The subdivision developer or owner shall be required to keep all subdivision streets, right-of-ways, required traffic signs and signals, and all other subdivision improvements in good repair during the developer maintenance period, and any extensions thereof. As an assurance of such continued maintenance the city and/or planning commission may designate a lot or lots which shall be held in abeyance (not eligible for sale or issuance of building permits) until the owner or developer is in full compliance with the intent and conditions of the developer maintenance period.
( Ord. No. 546, 6-10-10 )
Sec. 19-72. - Dedication of subdivision improvements.
After the developer maintenance period and any applicable required extensions have expired, or terminated upon approval by the city, the subdivision developer or owner shall request the planning commission and applicable city departments to make a final inspection of all subdivision improvements. Should any defects exist, they shall be immediately remedied after which a final inspection shall again be requested. Upon inspection approval the subdivision owner or developer shall request in writing that all subdivision improvements be dedicated to, and accepted by, the City of Thomson. Upon acceptance by the city all approved lots being held shall be released for construction whereupon the subdivision owner or developer shall be relieved of future maintenance and assurances related to all subdivision improvements.

Sec. 19-73. - Variances.
(a)
Board variances. Upon review of an initial verbal request for the granting of a variance(s), the planning commission shall investigate the circumstances surrounding the variance request to ascertain the validity and legitimacy of such request. Only if the causes prompting the request are beyond the control of the developer will the planning commission allow an application to be submitted for planning commission board review. Mere inconvenience, financial or otherwise, shall not constitute authorization for an application for a variance. Should a variance application be approved for submittal, the applicant shall submit to the planning commission a specific request for such which shall include specific and detailed justifications why such variance(s) should be granted. The recommending of any variances by the planning commission board, and the granting as any variance by the city council shall be stated in the minutes of the of the respective board meeting with the reasons for which the departure was justified and the conditions under which such variance was granted.
(b)
Administrative variances. The planning commission is hereby authorized to grant variances to requirements of this chapter provided the intent of this chapter is maintained.
