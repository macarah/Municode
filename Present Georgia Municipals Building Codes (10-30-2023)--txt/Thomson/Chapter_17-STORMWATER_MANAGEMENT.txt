The enumerated conditions required to exist on any matter upon which the city planning commission is authorized to pass under this section shall be construed as limitations on the power of the city planning commission to act.
b.
Approval of request. In approving any request the city planning commission may designate such conditions in connection therewith in order to secure substantially the objectives of the regulation or provision to which such variance is granted and to provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the area in which such permit is granted.
c.
Denial of request. No appeal or application for appeal that has been denied shall be further considered by the city planning commission until a subsequent request is obtained by the filing of new plans and a decision rendered thereon by the building director.
(5)
Appeals from decision of the city planning commission. Any person, jointly or separately aggrieved by a decision of the city planning commission, may present to the superior court a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of such illegality.

(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-74. - Methods of controlling downstream flooding.
The city planning commission shall determine whether the proposed plan will cause or increase downstream flooding conditions. This determination shall be made on the basis of existing downstream development and an analysis of stormwater runoff with and without the proposed development as set forth in this chapter. When the city planning commission determines that the proposed development will cause or increase downstream flooding conditions during the 100-year storm, provisions to minimize such flooding conditions shall be included in the design of storm drainage improvements. Such provision may include downstream improvements and/or the temporary controlled detention of stormwater runoff and its regulated discharge to the downstream storm drainage system.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-75. - Downstream improvements.
Improvements to minimize downstream flooding conditions may include, but not be limited to, the construction of dams, dikes, levees and floodwalls; culvert enlargements; and channel clearance and modification projects. Such downstream improvements should be discussed between the city planning commission, the city engineer and the developer's engineer so that appropriate provisions with respect to planning and implementing such improvements can be made at the earliest possible date.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-76. - Detention.
Developments also may include temporary detention of stormwater runoff in order to minimize downstream flooding conditions. The following design criteria shall govern the design of temporary detention facilities:
(1)
Storage volume. The volume of storage provided in detention basins shall be sufficient to control the differential runoff from the 50-year storm frequency of six-hour duration. The differential runoff is that volume and rate of flow of stormwater runoff discharged from a parcel of land or drainage area which is or will be greater than that volume and rate which pertained prior to proposed development or redevelopment.
(2)
Freeboard. Detention storage areas shall have adequate capacity to contain the storage volume of tributary stormwater runoff with at least two feet of freeboard above the water surface of flow in the emergency spillway in a 100-year storm or as required by state law.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-77. - Outlet control works.

(b)
Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components or devices and shall function without requiring attendance or control during operation.
(c)
Size and hydraulic characteristics shall be such that all water in detention storage is released to the downstream storm sewer systems within 24 hours after the end of the design rainfall.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-78. - Spillway.
Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe passage of runoff generated by a 100-year storm or greater, if required by law, or if appropriate because of downstream high hazard, such as loss of life or damage to high value property.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-79. - Design data submittal.
In addition to complete plans, the following design data shall be submitted to the city planning commission for all projects including temporary detention facilities:

(2)
Runoff hydrograph plotted in units of cubic feet per second runoff rate of the tributary area as ordinates, and time from the start of runoff as abscissas.
(3)
Capacity curve for proposed detention facility plotted in units of datum elevation as ordinates, and cumulative volume of storage as abscissas.
(4)
Discharge characteristics curve or outlet works plotted in units of detention facility water surface elevation as ordinates, and discharge rate for cubic feet per second (CFS) as abscissas.
(5)
Inflow and outflow curves in units of accumulated volume as ordinates, and time from the start of runoff as abscissas. Curves shall be so arranged that the vertical distance between the accumulated storage and accumulated discharge will indicate the net volume in storage and accumulated discharge will indicate the net volume in storage at any point in time. Curves shall be extended to the time required for complete discharge of all runoff stored in the detention facility.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-80. - Detention methods.
In addition to the above criteria, the following shall be applicable, depending on the detention alternative(s) selected by the city engineer and the developer's engineer:
(1)
Wet bottom basins. For basins designed with permanent pools:
a.
Minimum depths. The minimum normal depth of water before the introduction of excess stormwater shall be four feet.
b.
Depth for fish. If fish are to be used to keep the basin clean, at least one-quarter of the area of the permanent pool must have a minimum depth of ten feet.
c.
Facilities for emptying. For emptying purposes, cleaning or shoreline maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for the use of auxiliary equipment to permit emptying and drainage.
(2)
Dry bottom basins. For basins designed to be normally dry:
a.
Interior drainage. Provisions must be incorporated to facilitate interior drainage to outlet structures.
b.
Multipurpose features. There shall be designed to serve secondary purposes for recreation open space or other types of use which will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding.
(3)
Rooftop storage. Detention storage may be met in total or in part by detention on roofs. Details of such designs, which shall be included in the drainage permit applications, shall include the depth and volume of storage, details of outlet devices and downdrains, elevations of overflow scuppers, design loadings for the roof structure and emergency overflow provisions. Direct connection of roof drains to sanitary sewers is prohibited.
(4)
Parking lot storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide temporary detention storage of stormwater on all or a portion of their surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to slowly empty the stored waters and depths of storage must be limited so as to prevent damage to parked vehicles.
(5)
Other storage. All or a portion of the detention storage may also be provided in underground or surface detention facilities, to include basins, tanks, swales, etc.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-81. - Stormwater channel location.
Generally acceptable locations of stormwater runoff channels in the design of a subdivision may include but not be limited to the following:
(1)
In a depressed median of a double roadway, street or parkway provided the median is wide enough to permit maximum three to one side slopes.
(2)
Centered on lot lines or entirely within the rear yards of a single row of lots or parcels.
(3)
In each of the foregoing cases, a drainage easement to facilitate maintenance and design flow shall be provided and shown on the plat. No structures shall be constructed within or across stormwater channels.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-82. - Storm sewer outfall.
The storm sewer outfall shall be designed so as to provide adequate protection against downstream erosion and scouring.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-83. - Lot lines.
Whenever the plans call for the passage and/or storage of floodwater, surface runoff or stormwater along lot lines, the grading of all such lots shall be prescribed and established for the passage and/or storage of waters, and no structure may be erected which will obstruct the flow of stormwater, no fences, shrubbery, or trees planted, or changes made to the prescribed grades and contours of the specified floodwater or stormwater runoff channels.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-84. - Manholes.
All sanitary sewer manholes constructed in a floodplain or in an area designed for the storage or passage of floodwater or stormwater, shall be provided with either a watertight manhole cover or be constructed with a rim elevation of a minimum of one foot above the high-water elevation of the design storm, whichever is applicable to the specific area.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-85. - Easements.
Permanent easements for the detention and conveyance of stormwater, including easements of access to structures and facilities, shall be dedicated to the city.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-86. - Maintenance.
Provisions acceptable to the city for perpetual maintenance of detention facilities, outlet works and appurtenances shall be made, as provided, in these regulations.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
Sec. 17-87. - Drainage permits.
A drainage permit for projects including detention facilities may be granted by the city planning commission only after the stormwater management plan has been approved and all easements have been dedicated, accepted, and recorded, and all required maintenance assurances and required bonds have been executed.
(Ord. No. 448, 6-8-89)
