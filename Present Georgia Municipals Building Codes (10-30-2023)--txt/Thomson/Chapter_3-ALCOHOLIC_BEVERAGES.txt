An act or omission of a licensee, stockholder, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment, willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law, or of any provision of this article, will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of its license in accordance with the provisions of this article, when the city council determines to its satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues.

(Ord. No. 499, 4-9-98)
Sec. 3-59. - Suspension, revocation, denial of renewal or transfer.
(a)
Notice, hearing. Any license which has been issued under this article may be denied, suspended or revoked or transfer refused, by the city council for due cause. Before the city council shall deny any application for a license or for the transfer of any license, or shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant shall be given notice in writing from the city to show cause before the city council at a time and place specified therein not less than three days nor more than 14 days from the date of service of this notice, why the application for, or renewal of, a license or transfer of license should not be denied, or why the license should not be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefor, and at the appointed time and place the applicant or licensee shall have an opportunity to show cause, of any exists, why the application should not be denied or the license revoked or suspended, after which the city council shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts. The hearing provided for in this subsection need not be at a regular meeting of the city council, but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in the notice. All decisions denying, suspending or revoking any license or application shall be in writing, with reasons therefor stated, and mailed or delivered to the applicant. In addition, at any hearing as provided for in this subsection, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, have an attorney, and have testimony recorded at his expense. The decision of the city council shall be by majority vote of the members present at the meeting. Within three days from the date of the hearing, the city council shall render a decision in writing and furnish a copy of the decision to the licensee. The decision of the council shall be effective immediately, whether or not the licensee can be personally served with the written copy of the decision. The decision of the city council shall be final unless appealed within 30 days from the date of said finding by certiorari to the county superior court.
(b)
Due cause generally. "Due cause" for the suspension, revocation or denial of the renewal or transfer of any license shall consist of an act or omission found to be by the city council, after a hearing as above provided, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, or for the violation of any state or federal law, or for the violation of any city ordinances, other than traffic violations or ordinances, or failure of the licensee or his employee to promptly report to the police department any violation of the law or ordinance breach of peace, disturbance or altercation, resulting in violence occurring inside the premises.
(1)
Due cause may also be found should the licensed establishment have become a "trouble spot" in the judgment of the city council by reason of disturbances or acts of disorderly conduct or violence having occurred in the establishment or on the premises thereof; provided that when the license of any establishment has been revoked or renewal of license denied because such establishment has become a "trouble spot," no further license shall be issued under this article to any person at such location for a period of at least 12 months from the date of revocation.
(2)
Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof, or the owner or any person connected therewith, ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this article.
(3)
Due cause may also be found upon the revelation of any false statement or material misrepresentation in any application hereunder. Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license.
(4)
Failure to control operation resulting in a public nuisance. If the failure to control the operation either inside the building or outside on the property results in controlled substance abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the city council, after proper hearing, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance, such failure may be declared to be "due cause" for suspension or revocation of the beer, wine or distilled spirits license for such establishment, or the denial of renewal application for same.
(c)
Discontinuance of sale. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or employee hereunder to cooperate with any police officer on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all policy powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the chief of police shall immediately order all sales of any alcoholic beverages suspended until after a hearing as set out in the "due cause" hearing provided for in subsection (a) of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate.
(d)
Refund of license fee. When a license is revoked or suspended, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license fee.
(e)
Effect of revocation by state. Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell any alcoholic beverage at retail, the city license to deal in such product shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the city council or any municipal officer. If the state has suspended the license or placed the same on probation, then the city license is automatically suspended or probated, as the case may be.
(f)
Emergence situation. The mayor is the delegated authority to suspend any license hereunder in any emergency situation, and the said suspension may be made effective immediately and remain in force until the next regular or called meeting of the city council. In addition, in any emergency situation, the chief of police is hereby authorized to cause the business in question to close temporarily until he decides the emergency or possible riotous situation to be at an end, or until such decision is made by the city council at its next regular meeting, whichever occurs first.
