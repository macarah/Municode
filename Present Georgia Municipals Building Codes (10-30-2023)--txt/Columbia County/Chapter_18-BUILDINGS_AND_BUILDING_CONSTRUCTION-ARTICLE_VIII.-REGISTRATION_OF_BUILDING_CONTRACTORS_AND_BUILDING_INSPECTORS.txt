The Undersigned Agrees As Follows:
Columbia County ordinances require that residential construction work shall be performed by registered residential builders. I have applied for a do it yourself registration. The registration allows me, as the owner of my property, to act as my own residential builder even though I have not registered as a residential builder. I must supervise the construction myself. I may build or improve a single-family residence for use and occupancy only by myself and my family. It may not be built for sale or rent. If I sell or rent a building I have built myself within two years after the construction is complete, it will be presumed (subject to my right to rebut same) that I built the home for sale or rent, which is a violation of the ordinance. I may not hire an unregistered person or entity to perform services for me as a residential builder. It is my responsibility to make sure that people employed by me have the registration certificates required by Columbia County's contractor registration ordinances. My construction must comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, building codes, and zoning regulations.
