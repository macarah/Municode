ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL

Sec. 74-36. - Generally.
(a)
Review of subdivision plats helps to ensure that all subdivision and sale of land complies with the applicable requirements of the Columbia County Code of Ordinances. Review of a subdivision plat is required for any:
(1)
Division of land into two or more lots;
(2)
Recombination of two or more lots;
(3)
Extension of public utilities (other than individual service lines) or other public facilities;
(4)
Dedication of public right-of-way;
(5)
Abandonment of existing public right-of-way; and
(6)
Extension of public streets.
(b)
Types of plats. There are two types of plats—Minor plats, approved by the director of planning services, and major plats, approved by the Columbia County Planning Commission.
(1)
Minor plats. Plats meeting the following criteria are minor plats:
a.
The subdivision will result in the creation of no more than four lots.
b.
The subdivision does not require the extension of public utilities (other than individual service lines) or other public facilities. No substantial alteration of existing utility installations is involved.
c.
The subdivision does not require the dedication of public right-of-way.
d.
Each proposed lot meets the requirements of the Columbia County Code of Ordinances.
e.
The subdivision meets the requirements of section 74-42, additional requirements for minor plats.
(2)
Major plats.
a.
A subdivision plat that is not a minor plat is considered a major plat.
(c)
Major plats must be approved by the planning commission as follows:
(1)
Submission of conceptual design. Early in the project and prior to any detailed design work, the prospective subdivider shall submit to the planning commission a conceptual design that illustrates how the proposed subdivision addresses existing site conditions, including topography, sensitive environmental and cultural features, and adjacent land uses, in accomplishing the overall development goals. Applicants or property owners proposing the subdivision of land that will not require a land disturbance permit are not required to submit for conceptual design approval. In making application for conceptual design approval, the prospective subdivider shall submit:
a.
A survey of the existing site conditions, including existing topography, significant trees, waterways, wetlands, floodplains, and other environmentally sensitive features; existing structures, including any historic or cultural resources; utilities; and transportation facilities; and
b.
A general land use plan illustrating proposed access points; street layout; approximate size and location of building types; recreational facilities; open space areas; and environmental protection areas.
(2)
Submission of preliminary plat. Prior to making any street improvements or installing any utilities, the prospective subdivider shall submit to Columbia County a preliminary plat as specified in section 74-37 that meets the general layout and intent of the approved conceptual design, as well as the performance and maintenance bond required by section 74-45, and environmental bond required by section 34-70(b)(6). Where circumstances warrant, the planning commission may modify the requirements contained in this chapter in accordance with section 74-118. Approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission constitutes authorization for the subdivider to develop the subdivision subject to the minimum standards for improvements set forth in article IV of this chapter, and the minimum standards of design set forth in article III of this chapter.
(3)
Submission of final plat. After approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat and other documents as may be required in connection therewith. A final plat, in accordance with section 74-38, may be approved by the planning commission at any point after approval of the preliminary plat, or concurrently, provided that the requirements of section 74-45 have been met. No building permits shall be issued prior to the written approval of the final plat and subsequent as-built drawings.
(4)
Submission of plat of record. Upon approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall submit a plat of record prepared in accordance with section 74-39 to the planning commission for its approval.
(5)
Submission of as-built drawings. Upon the completion of improvements, the subdivider shall submit to Columbia County engineered drawings that show the exact dimensions, geometry, and location of all elements of the work completed.
(d)
Appeals.
(1)
Minor plats. An applicant or property owner requesting minor plat approval may appeal the director's decision to the planning commission. A written request for appeal must be received within 15 days of the director's decision, and must specify the grounds for appeal.

Sec. 74-42. - Additional requirements for minor plats.
Where approval is sought for a plat which depicts the subdivision of a tract of land into not more than four lots or tracts of land, including the remaining portion of the original tract which shall be treated as one of the four lots, the following conditions must be met:
(1)
The size and shape of each lot resulting from the subdivision must meet the minimum standards set forth in chapter 90 of this Code for the zoning district in which the land being subdivided is located, except that if the parent tract does not have 150 feet of public road frontage the subdivision may be approved if it provides access to the newly formed lots as described in subsection (2) below.
(2)
Ingress and egress to each lot resulting from the subdivision is provided by an access road at least 30 feet in width fronting on a public road of not less than 30 feet in width, with a curb cut for the access road of not less than 18 feet in width. Such access road shall run back to some or all four of the lots in the subdivision by frontage on a private road of not less than 30 feet in width with the owners of the lots owning either fee simple title to, or a permanent easement over, a strip or strips of land not less than 30 feet in width which permanent easement or fee simple strip may be exclusive to one or more of the lots or non-exclusive for use by all of the lots; provided that all of the lots must have the required ingress and egress. Such fee simple title or permanent easement shall not serve land not included in the subdivision as shown on the plat. Under no circumstances shall there be more than two access roads serving the lots in the subdivision. The topography of such 30-foot wide strip or strips of land must be suitable for the construction and maintenance of an access road to the lots being served, and it must not be burdened with improvements, easements or other encumbrances that would interfere with its use as a right-of-way for an access road. Any access road serving the lots must consist of dirt, gravel or a higher grade paving surface at least 18 feet in width. The access road can be maintained on a surface of dirt except at the point where the access road intersects the public road where the paving of the access road must consist at least of gravel from the edge of the paved county road to the right-of-way line of the county road in order to protect the paving of the county road.
(3)
If the deed or deeds to any of the lots do not provide for maintenance and repair of the access road(s) in accordance with the requirements set forth herein, then the cost of maintenance and repair of the access road(s) must be paid in equal shares by the owners of each of the lots depicted on the plat, and each such owner shall be responsible for seeing that such maintenance and repair is performed. If the county engineer, in his/her discretion, is satisfied that all of the conditions of this section have been met, then the plat may be submitted by the county engineer to the planning commission for approval or in those situations where permitted, to a licensed surveyor for certification. Columbia County shall not be responsible for construction, repair or maintenance of any access road unless the county has accepted ownership of the road in accordance with all requirements which have been established by the county.
(4)
Any plat or map for which approval is sought under this section 74-42 of the Code must meet the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67 in order that the clerk of superior court shall file and record in his/her office such maps and plats in the county. This will require approval by the county planning commission unless there is an exemption under [O.C.G.A.] § 15-6-67(d).
(5)

Sec. 74-43. - Subdivisions with private roads.
(a)
The subdivision of land creating lots abutting on private roads shall be permitted, provided that the:
(1)
Private roads and the rights-of-way therefor are constructed and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this Code and minimum specifications therefor, as promulgated from time to time by the board of commissioners.
(2)
Fee simple title to the rights-of-way for the roads are vested in the owners of the lots abutting such private roads, or a nonprofit state corporation of which all owners of lots having a right to use the roads are required by covenants running with the land to be members (referred to in this section as the "owner's association").
(3)
Private roads are subject to a perpetual easement for ingress and egress to all of the lots in the subdivision, which easement shall be appurtenant to and pass with title to the lots in the subdivision.
(4)
Owner's association shall, by covenants running with the land recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court, have the obligation to maintain the private roads and rights-of-way therefor in a good, safe and well-kept condition, and shall be required to levy annual assessments on lots in the subdivision to pay the cost thereof, and to establish and maintain reasonable reserves for future significant repair, rebuilding, repaving and maintenance of such roads, not required on an annual basis, which assessments, if unpaid, when due, become and continue to be a lien on the lot against which they were levied until they are paid.
(b)
A subdivision of land creating lots fronting on private roads shall require approval of a preliminary plat and a final plat as set forth in this chapter for subdivisions using public roads, which shall be filed with the engineering services department for processing and consideration by the planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners if any of the improvements located in such subdivision are to be dedicated to the county. At the time of the filing of the plat for preliminary approval, the owner of the land shall also file all legal instruments, including, but not limited to, grants of easements, declarations of covenants and articles of incorporation and bylaws of the owner's association, to be reviewed by the county attorney to determine if all of the requirements of subsection (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section have been met. At the time of requesting final plat approval, a copy of the signed documents, with all exhibits attached, together with a certificate of incorporation for the owner's association from the secretary of state and a copy of the minutes of the organizational meeting of the owner's association certified by its secretary must be furnished to the county attorney for review.
(c)
Subdivisions containing more than four lots, but not more than 12 lots, including the remaining portion of the original tract, access to which is provided by private roads, shall, at a minimum, provide access to the lots by not more than two private roads which must be at least 18 feet in width located within a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet in width, and built and paved in accordance with specifications established by the board of commissioners. If a subdivision is developed and access provided pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the lots resulting from such subdivision, including the remaining portion of the original tract, may not be further subdivided without meeting all of the requirements of articles III and IV of this chapter for the development of subdivisions. Any subdivision containing more than 12 lots, access to which is provided by private roads, shall provide access to the lots by roads meeting all of the requirements of articles III and IV of this chapter for the development of subdivisions; provided, however, that if all of the lots in the subdivision are five acres or larger, the streets do not have to be paved, but must meet all other development construction standards. If all lots in the subdivision are 2.5 acres or larger, concrete curbs and gutters are not required. The term "original tract," as used in this subsection, means the entire tract of land as it existed immediately prior to the subdivision of any portion thereof as depicted on the plat for which approval is being sought.
(d)
An appropriate permanent sign identifying the roads in the subdivision as private roads must be erected by the developer and maintained in good condition by the owner's association or the developer at all locations where private roads intersect with public roads.
(e)
Subdivisions developed with the use of private roads must, except as specifically otherwise provided in this chapter, comply with all other requirements of this Code dealing with or relating to the subdivision of land and the construction of improvements on such land.
(f)
No plat of a subdivision of land utilizing private roads for ingress and egress to the lots contained in such subdivision shall be approved unless it is in full compliance with the requirements of this section, unless a variance from any such requirement is granted by the board of commissioners.
(Code 1979, § 2-13-25)
Sec. 74-44. - Reserved.

A performance and maintenance bond, letter of credit, cash bond, or other equivalent form of security as approved by the county attorney, running in favor of the county, in a minimum amount of $5,000.00 or any amount equal to at least ten percent of the actual construction cost of all improvements to be dedicated to the county, whichever is greater, shall be posted with the county by all subdividers or persons where street or other improvements are made and offered to the county for acceptance and maintenance except as noted in this section. The performance and maintenance bond, cash bond, letter of credit or other equivalent form of security shall guarantee all improvements against defects in design, material and workmanship and further guarantee that all such improvements shall be installed and maintained in first class condition for the required period and faithful performance by the subdivider or other person of all provisions of this chapter.
(1)
Any bond, except cash bond, or letter of credit or other equivalent form of approved security shall be on forms supplied by the county and shall not be terminated or otherwise allowed to expire prior to the satisfactory completion of the maintenance period under section 74-46, or until released by the board of commissioners. Such bond, cash bond, letter of credit or other equivalent form of approved security along with evidence of payment of the required premiums shall be filed with the county.
(2)
Such bond, cash bond, letter of credit or other equivalent form of security shall be posted prior to commencement of construction. No preliminary plat shall be approved or recorded by the county and no construction shall commence until and unless a satisfactory bond is posted.

Sec. 74-46. - Maintenance.
(a)
All subdivisions in which subdivider intends to dedicate all, or a portion of, the improvements located thereon to the county shall meet the requirements of this section. The subdivider shall maintain and repair all improvements, other than water and sewer, dedicated to the county for two years, unless extended pursuant to this section, from the date of written acceptance of the as-built drawings. The subdivider shall pay the reasonable costs for the county to maintain and repair all dedicated water and sewer improvements for two years, unless extended pursuant to this section.
(1)
The subdivider shall request in writing that the county inspect the development at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the maintenance period. Failure to notify the county in writing shall extend the maintenance period until inspection is requested and all determined improvements are made.
(2)
If upon inspection as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the county determines that work or repairs are needed in order for the improvements to meet county specifications or requirements under this chapter, the subdivider shall be notified in writing by the department of the deficiencies, failure to comply or violations. Thereafter, for deficiencies, failure to comply or violations related to improvements other than water and sewer, the subdivider shall extend the maintenance bond one year and shall have 60 days from receipt of such notification to correct such deficiencies, noncompliance or violations. If the deficiencies, noncompliance or violations are not corrected within such time, then the maintenance bond, cash bond, letter of credit or equivalent form of approved security posted by the subdivider shall be, if approved by the board of commissioners, forfeited and called upon up to the cost of the repairs or the total amount of the bond. Should the amount of the bond be inadequate to pay for the cost of correcting the deficiencies, noncompliance or violations, then the subdivider shall pay any and all costs beyond bond coverage. For deficiencies, failure to comply or violations related to water and sewer, the subdivider shall pay the county the reasonable cost to correct the same.
(3)
The subdivider shall pay to the county for each inspection, subsequent to the initial inspection provided under subsection (1) of this section, a reinspection fee in an amount set from time to time by resolution of the board of commissioners to defray the cost of reinspection.
(4)
The maintenance period shall continue until such time as the county has inspected and accepted the improvements in writing.
(5)
If a period of 30 months elapses from the commencement of the maintenance period for any subdivision and defects, noncompliance or violations still exist to the extent that the subdivision has not been accepted by the county, the county is authorized to withhold the issuance of any and all permits or to refuse inspection to subdivider on the project in dispute and any other project in which the subdivider, or officer or owner thereof, has a financial interest.

ARTICLE III. - GENERAL STANDARDS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN

Sec. 74-76. - Suitability of land.
(a)
Land physically unsuitable for subdivision. The planning commission has found the following land to be unsuitable for development:
(1)
Land which is subject to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations or other such features which may endanger health, life or property, aggravate erosion, increase flood hazard or necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for supply and maintenance of services; and
(2)
Land which other public agencies concerned have investigated and found, in the best interest of the public, not suitable for the type of platting and development proposed;
such lands shall not be approved for subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by subdivision of such land.
(b)
Land unsuitably located for subdivision. The planning commission shall not approve what it considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land which would endanger health, safety or property because of lack of or adverse effect on water supply, schools, proper drainage, good transportation, other public services or public funds for the supply or maintenance of such services.
(Code 1979, § 2-13-30)
Sec. 74-77. - Name of subdivision.
The name of each subdivision must have the approval of the planning commission. The subdivision name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision.
(Code 1979, § 2-13-31)
Sec. 74-78. - Street classifications.
Streets and roads are classified in the county growth management plan according to the function that they are to serve the type, speed and volume of traffic they will carry, and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets and roads as used in this chapter shall be as follows:
(1)
Primary arteries;
(2)
Secondary arteries;
(3)
Collector streets; and
(4)
Land service streets.
The designation in the county growth management plan of arterials and collectors shall not prevent other streets proposed in or adjoining subdivisions from being similarly classified. For the purposes of this chapter, land service streets are further classified by street design and use. Street classifications and subclassifications are as follows:
(1)
Primary arteries—(PA)
(2)
Secondary arteries—(SA)
(3)
Collector streets—(CS)
(4)
Land service streets—(LS)

Sec. 74-79. - Relation to present, proposed and future street system.
(a)
Location and width of streets and roads. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official major road plan as adopted by the planning commission.
(b)
Connection of at least one existing street: At least one connecting street that terminates at, adjoins, or traverses a proposed subdivision and which will be used to provide access to the subdivision shall be a paved road not later than the approval of final plat for the first phase of the subdivision. If such access road is not a paved road it must be paved continuously in a manner meeting all of the requirements of this article from the nearest paved road on the public road system of the county, any adjoining county, any municipality located within the county or of the State of Georgia to at least one subdivision entrance. However, for those subdivisions that are creating lots under the provisions of section 74-42 of the Code, plats depicting subdivisions of four lots or less, and for those subdivisions that are creating lots larger than 15 acres under section 74-43 of the Code, subdivisions with private roads, at least one public road providing access to the subdivision shall be improved at least to the same standard as is required within the proposed subdivision from the nearest paved road on any of the public road systems described immediately above.
(c)
Layout of new streets: The proposed street system within a subdivision shall be determined by the planning commission to adequately balance the privacy of the future occupants with the free flow of traffic within the county, and to adequately provide for access for public safety by fire, police and emergency medical vehicles, and for school buses. In making such determination, satisfaction of the following requirements shall be considered by the planning commission:
(1)
In the opinion of the planning commission where it is necessary to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication and improvement of right-of-way to the boundary of such property.
(2)
Unless approved otherwise by the planning commission, a subdivision shall provide a street connection to each public street that it adjoins, and shall provide direct or indirect continuity through the subdivision between each connection.
(3)
The proposed street layout should be designed to minimize cut and fill within the right-of-way to provide better access to the subdivision lots. The design should also minimize the area of tree removal required for installation of streets, utilities and drainage features in order to reduce the number of large trees removed during construction.
(4)
To the greatest extent practical, cul-de-sacs should be avoided in favor of loop streets or a curvilinear or grid system of streets.
(d)
Reverse frontage lots:
(1)
Except in the R-A Residential-Agricultural district reverse frontage lots shall be provided along all arterial and collector roads abutting a residential subdivision unless the planning commission specifically determines that the provision of such lots would create an unusual and burdensome hardship on the property owner due to topographic or dimensional disadvantages of the property. Reverse frontage lots shall not be required in the R-A Residential-Agricultural district where lots are platted with road frontage widths greater than 150 feet and driveways are separated by more than 300 feet unless the planning commission determines that limiting access to the collector or arterial street is necessary for safety reasons.
(2)
An easement shall be provided to the county extending along the entire line of reverse frontage across which there shall be no right of access as follows:
a.
Equal in depth to the minimum front building setback required by the zoning district. Within the easement existing vegetation shall remain or shall be supplemented or replaced by additional planting to provide substantial natural screening between the lots and the arterial and collector roads. Existing trees with ten inches diameter at breast height (dbh) or greater shall not be removed unless removal is approved by the county to prevent danger due to injury or disease to the tree; or
b.
No less than 25 feet in depth and in accordance with the provisions and requirements of section 90-139, buffer requirements, of the zoning ordinance. Existing trees with ten inches diameter at breast height (dbh) or greater shall not be removed unless removal is approved by the county to prevent danger due to injury or disease to the tree.
(3)
All buffer and landscaping treatments are subject to the review and approval of the planning commission. Modifications may be approved by the planning commission to achieve equivalent screening results, depending on the topography, orientation or other physical factors of the site.
(e)
Interval of intersection with arteries. Subdivision streets which intersect an artery shall do so at intervals not less than the following:
(1)
Limited access primary artery, 1,200 feet;
(2)
Other primary artery, 800 feet; and
(3)
Secondary artery, 400 feet.
(f)
Large parcels. When land is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of streets in the future, and for logical resubdivision.

(d)
Reserved.
(e)
Service drives. Service drives or alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business purposes, and shall not be provided in residential blocks, except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys or service drives, such as subdividing adjacent to an artery, or where specifically required by the planning commission.
(f)
Culs-de-sac. Culs-de-sac shall not be more than 700 feet long unless necessitated by topographic or other conditions and approved by the planning commission. Such streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet.
(g)
Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, road, pike, drive, way, place, court or other derivatives. The planning commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication and in coordinating the names of streets within the subdivision through its index list of street names and guides for naming and suffixing.

Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet, nor more than 1,200 feet in length, except as the planning commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street patterns. In blocks greater than 800 feet in length, the planning commission may require at locations it deems necessary one or more public crosswalks of not less than ten feet in width to extend entirely across the block, or pedestrian easements in lieu thereof. (See section 74-83.)
(b)
Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two rows of lots, except where reverse frontage on major streets is provided or when prevented by topographic conditions or size of property or location next to an artery, in which case, the planning commission may approve a single row of lots.
(Code 1979, § 2-13-36)
Sec. 74-82. - Lots.
(a)
Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain a building site not subject to flood or periodic inundation.
(b)
Arrangement. Each lot must abut a public street or road. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines, where practical.
(c)
Minimum lot dimensions and areas.
(1)
The size and shape of lots shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the county's zoning regulations, chapter 90 of this Code, and orientation of lots shall be such as the planning commission deems appropriate for the use contemplated, type of water supply and sewage disposal, soil characteristics, improvements and relation to the street system.
(2)
The minimum depths of building setback lines for lots platted for all purposes shall be subject to the provisions of the county zoning regulations, chapter 90 of this Code, as well as the following:
a.
Wherever fill is proposed to raise land, the building setback line shall be located not less than 25 feet from the outer edge of the fill.
b.
To prevent infringement of sight lines at intersections, the setback distances for corner lots shall be based on the minimum stopping sight distances for automobiles approaching the intersection as set forth in section 74-80. The building setback line for the corner lot shall not be closer to the street right-of-way line than that line which connects the two points located on the centerlines of the two streets, the prescribed minimum stopping sight distance from the center of the intersection.
(3)
Properties reserved or platted for commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate in size to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes. Land shall not be platted for commercial or industrial purposes unless the subdivider can demonstrate to the planning commission:
a.
A site arrangement that prevents undue interference with through traffic. Each industrial subdivision or area shall utilize a single collector for all heavy traffic between the area and the general system of streets and roads. Industrial streets and individual industrial parcels shall be oriented at right angles with the collector and with adjacent railroads;

Numbered concrete monuments, four inches in diameter or square, three feet long with a flat top shall be set at all street corners, at all points where the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of a subdivision, at the intersection of curves and tangents along street lines and at all corners of the plot. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to properly identify the location, and shall be set flush with the finished grade. All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pipes or pins which are not less than three-fourths inch in diameter and 24 inches long, and shall be driven so as to be flush with the finished grade.
(b)
Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, drains, inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. All storm drainage systems shall comply with the county's specifications for such systems, and shall be approved by the county engineer before such systems may be installed and before final plat approval will be issued by the planning commission.
(c)
Street development. Every subdivision developer shall be required to grade and improve new streets and alley as follows:
(1)
Preparation of right-of-way. The full width of all roadways shall be prepared so that pavement and sidewalks, where required, may be constructed in such a manner that future extension of additional utilities or street improvements will not damage yards of abutting property. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line. Due regard shall be shown for desirable trees not impairing visibility.
(2)
Preparation of subgrade. Before grading is started, the entire area to be paved shall first be cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials. In all areas to be graded or filled, the subdivider shall stockpile the topsoil to be spread later in all disturbed areas not paved.
(3)
Protection of banks. Immediately after grading, filling and respreading of topsoil, all areas of disturbed soil shall be fertilized and seeded, or in steep areas, sodded or otherwise appropriately treated, with suitable vegetative cover to retard erosion.
(4)
Pavement base. Pavement base material shall conform to the county's specifications for such material, and shall be approved by the county engineer.
(5)
Minimum width of pavement. The minimum width of pavement, measured between curbs, required for arteries, collectors and land service streets shall be as follows:
_____

_____
(6)
Curb-and-gutter and paving. All new streets shall be surfaced by the developer with paving materials as required by county specifications regarding street paving and surface materials. Curbs and gutters on all new streets shall be constructed by the subdivision developer in accordance with the county's specifications for curbs and gutters. Raised asphalt curb is prohibited, unless proposed along streets in the R-A (residential agriculture) or R-1 (single-family residential) zoning districts. Where a subdivision abuts an existing state or county road, the developer shall be required to improve such road so that it will comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter.
(7)
Preparation and development of new streets. The preparation and development of all new streets shall comply with the county's specifications, and shall be approved by the county engineer before such streets may be developed and accepted by the county engineer and board of commissioners before final plat approval will be issued by the planning commission.
(8)
Turn lanes. Turn lanes may be required at all entrances to subdivisions and industrial and commercial developments which front on arterial and collector streets. Turn lanes shall be 12 feet in width, plus curb and gutter, for a minimum distance of 200 feet, which distance shall be measured from the intersection of the right-of-way lines.
(d)
Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required where deemed by the planning commission as an integral part of a pedestrian traffic system within a one-mile radius of existing or planned schools, neighborhood recreation or commercial areas or other public places. Where provided, sidewalks shall be located not less than one foot from the property line to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges or other plantings or structures placed on the property line at a later date.
(e)
Sanitary sewerage. In the areas of the county designated for sewerage service in the master sewerage plan prepared by the county engineer, all subdivision developers shall be required to install a sanitary sewerage collection system. The layout and specifications of the system shall be in accordance with the master sewerage plan and other applicable county specifications, and shall require the approval of the county engineer. Where sanitary sewerage collection systems are not specifically required by the county engineer, all lots shall contain adequate area for the installation and safe operation of approved septic tanks and disposal fields, and must be approved by the county health officer and other agencies having jurisdiction over such matters.
(f)
Public water systems. Each subdivision developer shall be required to provide a potable water supply subject to the approval of the county health officer. Where specifically required by the county engineer, each subdivision developer shall provide the subdivision service from the county water system. Any water lines or mains that are installed by any person which are to be attached to the water system of the county shall be constructed in accordance with county specifications and approved by the county engineer.
(g)
Site improvements. Banks which infringe on sight lines at intersections (see section 74-82(c)(2)) shall be appropriately graded to correct the deficiency. Wherever grading or filling occurs on lots within the subdivision, the subdivider shall first stockpile the topsoil from the affected areas immediately after grading and filling, and shall redistribute to areas of disturbed soil, sufficient topsoil to support growth of lawn grass and other vegetation, and shall immediately seed such areas with appropriate vegetative cover to prevent erosion, silting of streams and other damages. Due regard shall be shown for such desirable trees which are already on the site, and grading and filling should be planned to preserve as many of such trees possible; however, no retained planting shall infringe on sight lines at intersections. If trees are planted by the subdivider, they shall be located five feet inside or behind property lines where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chances of motor accidents and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted within a planting strip in the right-of-way, the proposed locations and species of such trees to be used must be submitted for the planning commission's approval since the public inherits the care and maintenance of such trees. The planning commission will assist the subdivider in location of trees and species to use under varying conditions. Where land is platted or reserved for commercial or industrial use bordering and across minor streets from residential lots, a suitable buffer planting of trees and shrubs which are approved by the planning commission shall be required, and such trees and shrubs shall not infringe on sight lines at intersections where planted.
(h)
Street name signs. Appropriate street signs add sales value to land subdivisions and enable strangers, delivery concerns and potential lot buyers to find their way around. Street name signs of a type approved by the county shall be placed at all intersections.

Sec. 74-118. - Variances.
The planning commission may authorize variances from the general requirements and minimum standards of design contained in this article and article III of this chapter, provided the subdivider makes a specific request and shows to the satisfaction of the planning commission that topographical or other conditions peculiar and particular to the site are such that strict adherence to the requirements of this article and article III of this chapter would cause such person an unnecessary hardship, and would not carry out the intent of this chapter. Any request for a variance shall be made on forms provided by the director. Upon receipt of an application for a variance, the director shall schedule a public hearing before the planning commission. Notice of the public hearing shall follow section 90-180(5) and hearing procedures shall follow section 90-180(6). Any authorized variance is to be stated in writing in the minutes of the planning commission with the reasons for which the departure was justified and the conditions under which such variance was granted.
