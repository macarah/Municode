Upon the failure of the defendant to answer or appear for the hearing, the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment by default, without further proof, when the claim of the plaintiff is for a liquidated amount.

(d)
An answer to the claim must be filed with the court or orally presented to the judge of the court within thirty (30) days after the service of the statement of claim on the defendant to avoid a default judgment. The answer shall be in concise form and free from technicalities but must admit or deny the claim of the plaintiff.

The notice shall be served on the plaintiff and the defendant by registered or certified mail to the address given by the plaintiff at the time he files his claim and the address given by the defendant at the time he files or presents his answer. The date of mailing shall be the date the notice is given.
(e)
At any time before final judgment, the court, in its discretion, upon payment of costs, may allow the default to be opened for providential cause preventing the filing of required pleadings or for excusable neglect or where the judge, from all the facts, shall determine that a proper case has been made for the default to be opened, on terms to be fixed by the court. In order to allow the default to be thus opened, the showing shall be made under oath, shall set up a meritorious defense, shall offer to plead instanter, and shall announce ready to proceed with the trial.
(f)
Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter [division], the magistrate court may grant relief from a judgment under the same circumstances as the state court may grant such relief. Requests for relief from judgments in the magistrate court shall be by filing a new action pursuant to this chapter [division]. The procedure shall then be the same as in other cases except the court may assess costs as seem just.
(g)
A complaint in equity to set aside a judgment of the magistrate court may be brought under the same circumstances as a complaint to set aside a judgment in a court of record.

(a)
The trial shall be conducted on the day set for hearing, or at such later time as the judge may set.

If the parties fail to settle their differences without a trial, the judge shall proceed with the hearing on its merits.
(b)
The judge shall conduct the trial in such manner as to do substantial justice between the parties according to the rules of substantive law. All rules and regulations relating to pleading, practice, and procedure shall be liberally construed so as to administer justice.
(c)
If the plaintiff fails to appear, the action may be dismissed for want of prosecution, the defendant may proceed to a trial on the merits, or the case may be continued as the judge may direct. If both parties fail to appear, the judge may continue the case, order the same dismissed for want of prosecution, or make any other just and proper disposition thereof, as justice may require.
Sec. 1-5-14. - Compulsory and permissive counterclaims.
(a)
If any defendant has a claim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim, which claim does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the court cannot obtain jurisdiction, such claim must be asserted by the defendant at or before the hearing on the plaintiff's claim or thereafter be barred.
(b)
If any defendant has a claim against the plaintiff other than a compulsory counterclaim described in subsection (a) of this Code section, such claim may be asserted by the defendant at or before the hearing on the plaintiff's claim.
(c)
If any defendant asserts a claim against the plaintiff, the defendant shall file with the court a statement of claim in concise form and free from technicalities. The defendant shall sign and verify the statement of claim by oath or affirmation. At the request of a defendant, the judge or clerk may prepare the statement.
(d)
If the amount of counterclaim exceeds the jurisdictional limits of the magistrate court, the case shall be transferred to any court of the county which has jurisdictional limits which exceed the amount of the counterclaim. If there is more than one (1) court to which the action may be transferred, the parties may agree on the court to which the action shall be transferred, and, in the absence of any agreement, the judge of the magistrate court shall determine the court to which the action shall be transferred. If there is no other court to which the action may be transferred, it shall be transferred to the superior court of the county.
(e)
A counterclaim may in the discretion of the magistrate be tried either separately or jointly with the plaintiff's claim.
Sec. 1-5-15. - Ordering deferred partial payment of judgment.
(a)
When the judgment is to be rendered and the party against whom it is to be entered requests it, the judge shall inquire fully into the earnings and financial status of such party and shall have full discretionary power to stay the entry of judgment, to stay execution, and to order partial payments in such amounts, over such periods, and upon such terms as seem just under the circumstances and as will assure a definite and steady reduction of the judgment until it is fully and completely satisfied.
(b)
The judge of the magistrate court shall not be obligated to collect such deferred partial payments on judgments so rendered but, if the plaintiff so requests, he may do so at the expense of the plaintiff for clerical and accounting costs incurred thereby, not to exceed ten (10) percent of each payment.
Sec. 1-5-16. - Effect, recordation, execution, and enforcement of money judgments; fee of recordation.
(a)
Except where otherwise provided by law, the general laws and rules applicable to the effect, recordation, execution, and enforcement of money judgments in civil cases in the superior courts of this state shall be applicable to and govern the magistrate courts.
(b)
Upon the issuance of any execution by the magistrate court, the clerk of the magistrate court shall immediately transmit a copy of the execution to the clerk of superior court of the county. The fee of the clerk of superior court for recording the execution on the general execution docket shall be charged and collected by the magistrate court contemporaneously with or prior to the issuance of the execution but not before the entry of judgment in the action; and such fee shall be transmitted by the clerk of magistrate court to the clerk of superior court together with the copy of the execution. The clerk of the superior court shall immediately enter the execution upon the general execution docket in the same manner as executions issued by the superior court, without the necessity of any action by the plaintiff in fi. fa.

Such a demand shall be written. Upon such a demand the court shall grant the demand. Failure to so demand removal of the case shall constitute a waiver of any right to trial by jury which the defendant may otherwise have.
Sec. 1-5-22. - Prosecution to be upon citation or accusation; service of citation or accusation.
(a)
Prosecutions for violations of county ordinances shall be upon citation as provided in O.C.G.A. § 15-10-63 or upon accusation by the county attorney or such other attorney as the board of commissioners may designate.

The board of commissioners or any state authority may provide that ordinance violations may be tried upon citations with or without a prosecuting attorney as well as upon accusations.

(b)
Any person who is accused by citation but has not been arrested may, but shall not be required to, give a cash bond for his personal appearance in court for trial.

It shall not be necessary for the county to take any further action to forfeit the cash bond. Forfeiture of a cash bond shall be deemed to constitute imposition and payment of a fine and shall be a bar to a subsequent prosecution of the accused for the violation. The court may, however, in any case enter an order pursuant to which bond forfeiture shall not be deemed to constitute imposition of a sentence and subsequent prosecution shall not be barred; and in any such case the amount of the bond forfeited shall be credited against any fine subsequently imposed.
