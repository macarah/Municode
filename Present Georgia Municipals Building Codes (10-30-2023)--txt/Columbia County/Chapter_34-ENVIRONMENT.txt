Sec. 34-1. - Major site grading.
(a)
Intent. The intent of this section is to provide guidance for the responsible design and development of land, while allowing the flexibility to develop sites with unique topographical or design features that require more extensive grading than a typical development.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to:
(1)
Allow for development of planned developments with creative and imaginative design features that are compatible with the area, but that may require more extensive grading than a typical development;
(2)
Ensure that the development of land maintains consistency with the county's comprehensive plan and all subsequent amendments and updates;
(3)
Protect the character and integrity of development within the county;
(4)
Provide for the effective development of public facilities and services for the site; and
(5)
Encourage efficient use of land for preservation of sensitive environmental and cultural resources, such as open space areas, waterways, wetlands, and topographic features.
(c)
Applicability. This section shall apply to all land disturbing activity beyond the minimum necessary to construct roads and related structures, best management practices for managing stormwater, stock pile staging areas, and material storage areas. Land disturbing activity required to construct individual residential or non-residential buildings on individual building lots, as well as land disturbing activity required to construct non-residential or multi-family developments, is exempt from the requirements of this section.
(d)
Design requirements.
(1)
For sites intended for residential development, a natural, undisturbed buffer with a minimum width of 50 feet shall be maintained along the exterior boundary of a site affected by major site grading. Effective protective measures shall be employed to ensure that the buffer remains undisturbed during construction. For sites smaller than ten acres, buffer requirements shall follow those required by section 90-139 of the Code. An alternate buffer plan for boundaries adjacent to rights-of-way may be approved by the planning commission as part of preliminary plat approval, provided that the alternate plan does not eliminate the undisturbed buffer completely and meets the intent of the overall buffering requirements of this section.
(2)
In addition to the requirements of section 90-141 pertaining to tree protection, street trees shall be provided and maintained within, or adjacent to, all existing and proposed street rights-of-way in accordance with the following requirements:
a.
Street trees shall be planted at a spacing of 40 feet on-center for shade trees or 20 feet on-center for ornamental and understory trees along the entire length of the street frontage of the proposed development or as approved by the administrator based on the development plans. Ornamental and understory trees shall be used as street trees only when there is an overhead obstacle which would preclude the use of taller-growing shade trees. A list of acceptable street trees is available in section 90-145.
b.
Street trees shall be planted in a minimum six-foot wide tree lawn between the curb and sidewalk, and shall be planted no closer than three feet from the curb or sidewalk. The planning services director may approve an alternate planting plan to avoid conflicts with utilities.
c.
Street trees shall include only those trees listed in the approved list of tree species in section 90-145, unless use of an alternative species is approved by the planning services director.
d.
Street trees shall be located and planted in a manner that minimizes conflicts with underground and above-ground utility lines and easements.
e.
A street tree planting plan shall be included with the development plan, and shall detail species, placement, size, number of trees, and the party responsible for perpetual maintenance.
f.
Street trees shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building to which the street trees closest relate.
(3)
A geotechnical/soils report prepared by a qualified geotechnical engineer shall be submitted with an application for a land disturbance permit and shall include the following information:
a.
Site conditions, including site topography, and vegetation.
b.
Engineering characteristics of the subsurface material together with laboratory test results to at least 24 inches below proposed grades or to refusal.
c.
Depth to groundwater if present within 24 inches of proposed grades.
d.
Conclusions as to the adequacy of the soils of the site for the proposed grading and recommendations of any corrective procedures, if required.
e.
Foundation and pavement design criteria. Pavement design criteria shall meet a minimum of eight inches of compacted GAB, two inches of compacted asphalt binder course, and one and one-half inches of compacted surface course.
f.
Site drainage and groundwater management recommendations.
(4)

b.
Cut slopes shall not exceed 20 feet in height unless horizontal benches with a minimum width of six feet are installed. Horizontal benches shall have proper drainage conveyance.
c.
All cut slopes greater than 6H:1V shall be located on one parcel. The top of a cut slope shall be no closer than one foot plus 50 percent of the height of the slope to an adjacent property line or environmentally sensitive area but no less than five feet.
d.
Subdrains shall be provided under any curb and gutter on public roadways of excavation greater than four feet.
(5)
Fill requirements.
a.
Fill slopes shall not be steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (2H:1V), for slopes steeper than 2H:1V, a slope stability report must be approved by Columbia County. Slopes shall be stabilized in accordance with GSWCC standards.
b.
Fill slopes shall not exceed 20 feet in height unless horizontal benches with a minimum width of six feet are installed. Horizontal benches shall have property drainage conveyance.
c.
All fill slopes greater than 6H:1V shall be located on one parcel. The toe of a fill slope shall be no closer than one foot plus 50 percent the height of the slope to an adjacent property line or environmentally sensitive area but no less than five feet.
d.
All fills greater than ten feet shall be placed, compacted, inspected and tested in accordance with the following provisions. All monitoring and testing shall be performed by a qualified soil testing agency engaged by the developer.
1.
Preparation of ground. The existing ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, and other incompetent material. Where the slope of the existing ground surface is SH:1V or steeper, the fill shall be supported on level benches cut into competent material. The bench under the toe of a fill on a slope steeper than 5H:1V shall be at least ten feet wide. The area beyond the toe of fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or have proper drainage conveyance away from toe. When fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the toe of fill shall be at least ten feet wide. The cut shall be accepted by Columbia County prior to placing the fill as a suitable foundation for fill.
2.
Subdrains shall be provided under all fills placed in natural drainage courses and in other locations where seepage is evident. Such subdrainage systems shall be of a material and design approved by Columbia County. The permittee shall provide periodic monitoring during the process of subdrain installation to conform to the approved plans.
3.
Fill material. Tree limbs, stumps, wood chips, and other such organic material shall not be permitted in fills. Soil containing small amounts of roots may be allowed, providing that the roots are in a quantity and distributed in a manner that will not be detrimental to the future use of the site and the use of such material is approved by Columbia County. Asphalt millings or waste may not be used for fill material. No rock or similar irreducible materials with a maximum dimension greater than eight inches shall be buried or placed in fill except as meeting the following requirements:
(i)
The oversized material shall be placed ten feet or more below finish grade;
(ii)
A representative of the soil testing agency shall be present while the oversized material is placed and covered;
(iii)
Reports submitted by the soil testing agency shall acknowledge the placement of the oversized material and whether the work was performed in accordance with his or her recommendations and the approved plans;
(iv)

4.
The fill shall be spread in a series of loose lifts, each not exceeding eight inches in thickness, and shall be compacted by sheepsfoot roller or other approved method after each layer is spread. The next lift shall not be placed until the compacted lift is tested or authorized by the soil testing agency.
5.
The moisture content of the fill material shall be controlled at the time of spreading and compaction to obtain required relative compaction.
6.
All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of 95 percent of maximum density as determined by A.S.T.M. D-1557 or other approved testing methods giving equivalent test results. If the required degree of relative compaction cannot be attained on sloped surfaces, the slope shall be over filled and cut back until the compacted inner core is exposed. Field density shall be determined by A.S.T.M. D-1556.
7.
A sufficient number of tests shall occur to satisfy the soil testing agency that all requirements have been met. As a minimum, a field density test, as herein provided, shall be taken for each 18 inches of fill, or portion thereof, measured vertically from the lowest point of the area to be filled, and for each 500 cubic yards of fill placed. In addition, in the case of subdivisions, at least one field density test shall be taken on each lot which receives fill. One field density test shall be taken on the slope face for every four feet in elevation of the slope or every 1,000 square feet of slope for each lot.
8.
All fills regulated by this Section shall be tested for relative compaction by a qualified soil testing agency. A certificate of compliance with the terms of this section and the grading permit, setting forth densities, relative compaction and other soil characteristics shall be prepared and signed by the soil testing agency. A compaction report shall be submitted to and approved by Columbia County before any final approval of the fill is given and before final platting of the subdivision.
e.
All filled lots shall be denoted on the final plat, with reference made to the applicable compaction report.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 34-106. - Purpose.
The county is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the county. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The board of commissioners has determined that development in the county to date, and the outlook for continued development at an increasing rate in the future, has created and will continue to create a need for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the county. The county has engaged a consultant to perform professional engineering and financial analyses of the county's stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to the county for dealing with stormwater management, and has received, reviewed and considered the results of the consultant's analyses which identify stormwater management needs, propose strategic program goals and priorities, estimate the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, examine reasonable charges by the county for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within the county to support such costs. The board of commissioners finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services, systems and facilities within certain more developed portions of the unincorporated areas of the county. The board of commissioners finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that a fair and equitable rate structure for those receiving the benefits of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the proceeds of which will be dedicated to the county stormwater utility for carrying out its purposes, will be essential if the county is to provide the level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of the county.
(Ord. No. 00-6, § 1(a), 8-15-2000)
Sec. 34-107. - Findings.
The board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact:
(1)
The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the county assesses and defines the stormwater management issues, needs, goals, program priorities and operational opportunities of the county.
(2)
Given the issues, needs, goals, priorities and operational opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the county, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of an accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the unincorporated areas of the county in concert with other water resource management programs.
(3)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, but it will be appropriate to provide different levels of service in the urban and suburban areas in contrast to the rural areas. Urban and suburban area development in some portions of the county has altered the natural hydrology of such areas, with some natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities. Other areas of the county remain less densely developed and rural in character, with natural stormwater drainage predominating, except along roads where ditches and culverts have been installed. As a result, the specific stormwater management services, systems and facilities needs differ from area to area in the unincorporated portions of the county. While the county manages, operates and improves certain stormwater management systems and facilities in the rural as well as urban and suburban areas, the need for improved stormwater management services, systems and facilities is greatest in the urban and suburban areas. A threshold level of stormwater management service, systems and facilities is needed countywide, but a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities is needed in the urban and suburban areas. Therefore, at this time, a stormwater utility service area in which stormwater service and user charges would be made should encompass only those urban and suburban area portions of the unincorporated areas of the county wherein the immediate needs are greatest and it is feasible for the county to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities at a higher level.
(4)
Given the need for a threshold level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities countywide, and a higher level of such services, systems and facilities in urban and suburban areas, it is equitable that the threshold level of such services, systems and facilities in all of the unincorporated areas of the county continue to be funded from the county's general tax revenues, and that the higher levels of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the urban and suburban areas be funded by stormwater utility user fees and service charges on properties in such urban and suburban areas. The county should reimburse the stormwater utility fund from its general tax revenues for providing the threshold level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities countywide.
(5)
The stormwater needs in the county include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities and regulation of the use therefor renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the county, and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the county concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses.
(6)
The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the longterm demands the properties owned impose on the county's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(7)
The county presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the county, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the county to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the county in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, the county must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems and facilities.
(8)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the county, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated portions of the county through stormwater service charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the county.
(9)
A schedule of stormwater utility service charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated area of the county. Such service charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners.
(10)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the county stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the county engineer. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property benefitted by such systems.
(11)
The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the county or to be provided by the county in the future, and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is there for the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge.
(12)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefor be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the county stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.
(Code 1979, § 2-6.1-30; Ord. No. 00-6, § 1(b)(2-6.1-30), 8-15-2000)
Sec. 34-108. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established.
(a)
There is established a stormwater utility to be known as the county stormwater utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the county's stormwater management services, systems and facilities.
(b)
There is established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the county budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses, as may be established by the board of commissioners from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund, and all expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management services, systems and facilities as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners.
(c)
The board of commissioners shall place within the county stormwater utility department the responsibility for operation, maintenance and regulation of the existing stormwater management services, systems and facilities previously performed, owned and operated or maintained by the county, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. This responsibility shall be placed with the county stormwater utility department as the board of commissioners has determined that the county stormwater utility department has been sufficiently organized, staffed and funded to adequately carry out such responsibilities. The board of commissioners shall determine which division of the county's governing body organization to place the stormwater utility in, and the board of commissioners may move the stormwater utility to other divisions from time to time as it sees fit.
(Code 1979, § 2-6.1-31)
Sec. 34-109. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto.
Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the county stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities for that particular property.
Detached single-family dwelling unit means developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling, and which contains one or more bedrooms, with bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. A detached dwelling unit may include a house, manufactured or mobile home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached single-family dwelling unit even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guest houses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Detached single-family dwelling units shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured and mobile homes located within manufactured or mobile home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties.
Developed land means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 200 square feet of impervious surfaces.
Duplexes and triplexes mean developed land containing two (duplex) or three (triplex) attached residential dwelling units located on one or more parcels of land.

(a)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of the county and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters. The potential impacts of these pollutant and nutrient loadings include:
(1)
Sediment which may alter natural systems, scouring vital habitat and smothering stream life;
(2)
Increased bacteria which may pose a significant health risk;
(3)
Excessive nutrients which may accelerate algal growth and eutrophication of receiving waters, adversely affecting flora and fauna;
(4)
Pollutants and nutrients which may negatively affect vital habitat for fish, birds, wildlife and native plant communities;
(5)
Metals which may be toxic to aquatic life;
(6)
Oil and grease which may reduce oxygen levels; and
(7)
Temperature of receiving waters may increase, which may adversely affect animal and plant habitat.
(b)
Uncontrolled stormwater drainage may increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
(c)
Altered land surfaces may change the rate and volume of runoff which may result in the following:
(1)
Streambanks may erode and slump, resulting in widening of streams;
(2)
Tree root systems may be undercut;
(3)
Erosion rates may increase; and
(4)
Streambeds may become more uniform and shallow, providing less varied aquatic habitats.
(d)
Adverse water quality and quantity consequences as set forth in this section could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment cost, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations.
(1)
Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
