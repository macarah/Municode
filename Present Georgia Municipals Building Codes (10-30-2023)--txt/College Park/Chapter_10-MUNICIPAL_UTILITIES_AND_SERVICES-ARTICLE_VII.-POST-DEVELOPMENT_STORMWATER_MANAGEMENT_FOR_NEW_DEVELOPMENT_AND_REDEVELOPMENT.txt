Sec. 10-193. - Objectives.
It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public through the following objectives:
(a)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(b)
Require that the new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increase in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(c)
Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(d)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(e)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan;
(f)
Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and
(g)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

Sec. 10-208. - Water runoff quality/reduction.
All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if:
(a)
It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual;
(b)
Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and
(c)
Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices.
Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
(i)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before the adoption of this article, the applicant may choose either (A) runoff reduction or (B) water quality.
(ii)
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after the adoption of this article, the applicant shall choose (A) runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent (A) runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then (B) water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2-inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least eighty (80) percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
(a)
