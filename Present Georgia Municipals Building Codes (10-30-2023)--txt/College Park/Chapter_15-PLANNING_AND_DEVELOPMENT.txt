Sec. 15-21. - Old National Corridor enterprise zone.
(a)
Statement of findings. The mayor and council of the city find that:
(1)
The area surrounding Old National Highway (the Old National Corridor) in the southern portion of the city is suffering from severe decline, disinvestment and encroaching blight;
(2)
Unemployment levels surrounding the Old National Corridor are significantly higher, by at least ten (10) percent, than the state average unemployment rate;
(3)
A disproportionately higher rate of crime exists in the Old National Corridor or Zone 3 of the city as compared with the remainder of the corporate limits;
(4)
A total of five hundred eighty-six thousand six hundred fifty-five (586,655) square feet of retail space has been abandoned from January 1, 1997 to the present time along the Old National Corridor;
(5)
The area surrounding Old National Corridor has seen the issuance of only two (2) land disturbance permits between 2003 and 2007; and that
(6)
Without significant governmental intervention by the city, deterioration of the Old National Corridor area will most likely continue, resulting in an ever destabilized tax base, increased blight and ever-increasing crime rate for that area.
(b)
Enterprise zone established; criteria of state met.
(1)
There is hereby created and established the Old National Corridor Enterprise Zone. The boundaries of such Enterprise Zone are delineated on Exhibits A and B to Ord.

Additionally, the business or service enterprise must engage in new construction; make additions to existing structures; engage in substantial renovation of existing structures; make a significant investment in equipment replacement or expansion; or otherwise alter the physical premises in which the business or service enterprise operates in a manner which adds substantial value to the structures. Cosmetic changes or remodeling to the appearance of a structure which does not increase the assessed valuation of the property by more than twenty-five (25) per cent does not meet the construction or renovation standards of this paragraph.

The burden shall be on an applicant to establish that the applicant meets the criteria set out in this section.
(e)
Maintenance and continuation of qualifying criteria. In order to maintain the incentives established by this section, a qualifying business or service enterprise shall maintain the new full-time job equivalents for an entire ten-year period. Every qualifying business or service enterprise shall provide to the city's director of development by December 31 of each year a written report on the full-time job equivalents for that calendar year. The director of development shall be responsible for monitoring compliance by every qualifying business or service enterprise with this section.

The agreement between the city and the qualifying business entered into pursuant to subsection (g)(1) shall include a clause granting the city's director of development to enter into the qualifying business facility at any time to audit and/or monitor compliance with this section.
(f)
Duration of enterprise zone. The Old National Corridor Enterprise Zone shall be established effective with the date of re-adoption of this section [August 17, 2009] and shall continue for a period of ten (10) years.

(g)
Incentives available to qualifying business.
(1)
Upon qualifying therefore, and by agreement with the city, qualifying business and service enterprises may be exempt from municipal ad valorem taxation which would otherwise be levied under chapter 18, article I on that portion of the business or service enterprise meeting the qualifying criteria, but only as to that portion of said taxes resulting from increased property value due to improvements made to the property by the qualifying business or service enterprise subsequent to qualification. The agreement with the city shall include a schedule of exemptions not to exceed the amounts set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-88-8(a)(1).
(2)
The tax exemption shall be effective upon approval by the mayor and council of the business or service enterprise as qualifying and upon execution of a contract between the City of College Park and such qualifying business or service enterprise. The effective date of the tax abatement shall begin on January 1 of the year following the effective date of approval and such tax exemption shall continue for ten (10) years, even if the Old National Corridor Enterprise Zone designation has terminated.
(3)
If the project consists of rehabilitation of an existing structure and the value of the improvement exceeds the value of the land by a ratio of five (5) to one (1), then the tax exemption schedule set out in subsection (g)(1) above shall apply whether or not the project is carried out by a qualifying business or service enterprise.
(4)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the event that the value of the property tax exemptions granted to qualifying business and service enterprises within all enterprise zones created by the city constitute ten (10) per cent of the property tax digest of the city, no further exemptions shall be available to new businesses.
(5)
The mayor and council reserve the right to amend this section at some future time to add additional development incentives as authorized by state law. Such additional incentives shall be applicable upon adoption of an amendment to this section and shall run coterminous with the existing tax incentives above described.
