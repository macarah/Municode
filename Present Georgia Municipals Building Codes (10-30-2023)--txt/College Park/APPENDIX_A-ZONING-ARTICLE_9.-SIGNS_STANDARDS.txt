ARTICLE 9. - SIGNS STANDARDS

9.1. - Purpose, Intent and Applicability.
A.
The City Council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard, a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city further finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations.
B.
The intent of this Article is to further the goals of the City of College Park's Comprehensive Plan; and establish the following purposes:
1.
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the rights of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of inappropriate signs;
2.
Further the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan;
3.
Protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals;
4.
Minimize vehicular and pedestrian hazards;
5.
Maintain the historic character of the city;
6.
Maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts;
7.
Ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State of Georgia and the United States Constitutions within the city;
8.
Place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the others of said nonconforming signs;
9.
Provide for the maintenance of signs, and for the enforcement of the provisions of this Article;
10.
Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse impacts and visual blight potentially created by signs;
11.
Promote economic development; and
12.
Ensure fair and uniform enforcement of sign regulations.
C.
Applicability. The provisions of this Article shall apply to all signs erected within the corporate limits of the city that are directed to be viewed from any outdoor space(s). All erection, construction, enlargement, moving, altering or converting of signs in the city shall be performed in compliance with the requirements of this Article.

The applicant agrees to remove at least one (1) nonconforming sign from the location at issue.

The nonconforming sign to be removed is highly visible from any public right-of-way or adjoining property.

The nonconforming sign to be removed has not been properly maintained.
4.

5.
Other aspects of the addition of the proposed sign(s) to the location at issue reasonably suggest that the proposed sign would benefit community aesthetics in conformance with the purpose of this Article as described in section 9.1.
6.
If the provisions above are not met due to the inability of the applicant to remove at least one (1) nonconforming sign, and if any nonconforming signs on such lot were previously agreed to by the city, the city may waive the provisions of this subsection, so long as the aggregate sign area of all signs on such lot does not exceed four hundred (400) square feet for every ten (10) contiguous acres or major fraction thereof. For purposes of determining the aggregate sign area, the city shall exclude the sign area of all nonconforming signs which were previously agreed to by the city.

2.
The benefits of granting the exemption would outweigh the ill effects of allowing the nonconforming sign proposed for removal to remain erected.
3.
If an applicant is seeking to waive the removal of any nonconforming sign pursuant to this section, there are no substantial new ill effects of allowing the nonconforming sign to remain erected along with any new sign(s).
4.
There is no negative effect on surrounding property values and that the erection of the proposed sign(s) would afford the applicant a reasonable opportunity to advertise.
5.
The grant of an exemption in no way confers any vested rights upon the applicant or the exempted plans, applications or requests.
D.
1.
A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, including face material except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels or painted boards on nonconforming signs shall be permitted.
