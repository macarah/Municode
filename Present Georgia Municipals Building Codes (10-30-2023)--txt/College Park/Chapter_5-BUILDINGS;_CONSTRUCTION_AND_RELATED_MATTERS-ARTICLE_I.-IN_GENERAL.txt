(f)
Conditions of the permit.
(1)
Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within ninety (90) days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned, in the opinion of the Building Official, for an accumulated period of ninety (90) days after the time the work is commenced. An extension of time, for a period of not more than one hundred eighty (180) days, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be granted or denied, in writing, by the Building Official.
(2)
Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the Building Official, are hazardous or complex, the Building Official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, the supervising architect or engineer shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the Building Official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the Building Official.
(3)
Plans. When the Building Official issues a permit, the Building Official shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "THIS PLAN HAS BEEN REVIEWED FOR CONSTRUCTION ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GIVEN.

One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the Building Official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the Building Official or the authorized representative.
(g)

(2)
The amount of such performance bond is to be determined by the Building Official. Under no circumstances shall the amount of such performance bond be less than an estimate of the total cost of completion of construction.
(3)
Such performance bond shall be forfeited if, at the expiration of the first permit extension, the work authorized by the permit is, in the opinion of the Building Official, suspended or abandoned. The forfeited funds of such performance bond shall be utilized by the Building Official to complete the scope of construction, as defined in the permit.
(4)
If such performance bond is not forfeited as provided in subsection (g)(3) herein, the bond shall not be released until the work authorized in the permit is satisfactorily complete. Satisfactory completion of construction shall be verified by the Building Official.
(5)
Second permit. An applicant who applies for a second permit to continue the performance of work authorized in another permit within three (3) months of, or after the lapse of, such permit shall post a performance bond pursuant to subsection (g)(1) herein. However, if the applicant for a second permit is not affiliated with the applicant for the first permit, the applicant for the second permit may, notwithstanding section 5-14, obtain a waiver of the performance bond upon petition to Mayor and Council. The term "affiliate" includes each person who falls into one or more of the following categories: each person having, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in the applicant; each person in which the applicant has, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest; each officer, director, joint venturer or joint venture partner, or the applicant; and, each person, directly or indirectly, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, the applicant.
