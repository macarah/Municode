Sec. 11-431. - Purpose and intent.
The intent of the city in adopting this entertainment filming ordinance is to facilitate entertainment industry work performed in the city while safeguarding the interests of the city's residents and businesses. The article simplifies the permitting requirements associated with filming by enabling entertainment industry professionals to obtain required city approvals through the department rather than through numerous individual departments. It strengthens the city's ability to anticipate and provide adequate services for the multiple filming projects throughout the city. It also enhances the city's ability to accommodate unanticipated circumstances and requested changes. The department similarly will respond to the needs of the city's neighborhoods regarding entertainment industry work and will promote community awareness of the entertainment industry's impact upon the city's economic development. This article furthers the city's commitment to being a best-in-class location to work and to live.
(Ord. No. 2017-17, § 1, 11-20-17)
Sec. 11-432. - Department of economic development as resource and liaison.
The department will serve as a resource for the city's residents and businesses, providing information upon request about current or scheduled filming, helping to resolve problems that arise from entertainment industry work, and acting as a liaison between residents, businesses and the entertainment industry to address inconvenience experienced generally and with regard to a specific project. The department will also serve as an ambassador to the entertainment industry, providing information, answering questions, helping to resolve challenges and facilitating the industry's work in the city. The department will implement other mechanisms that enhance the experience of all people performing and affected by entertainment industry work, which may include an informational web-page and on-line permitting. While permits are generally only required for entertainment industry work that occurs on public property only, the department will be a resource and liaison for all entertainment industry work, including work that occurs on private property. In an effort to remain abreast of all entertainment industry work occurring within the city, any such work that will occur solely on private property must be made known via completion and submission of an application to the department. However, no permit or permit fee shall be required for entertainment industry work conducted solely on private property that has no impact on public property as discussed in subsection 11-434(3) below.
(Ord. No. 2017-17, § 1, 11-20-17)
Sec. 11-433. - Permits for filming.

(2)
Filming permits shall be issued by the director. Permits shall be issued to the producer.
(3)
A permit will specify the filming that may occur at a particular location at a particular time.

Each day any violation of the entertainment filming ordinance continues shall constitute a separate offense.
(8)
While it is the intent of the city to honor each permit, the issuance of such permit shall not grant the producer a constitutionally protected property interest.

(a)
Where the substantial risk is identified prior to the commencement of the filming, the director and the applicable filming committee member shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the filming committee.
(b)
Where the substantial risk is not imminent and is identified after the commencement of the filming, the director and the applicable filming committee member shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s). Where such efforts are unsuccessful, the director shall modify the permit in a manner that minimizes disruption of the filming as determined at the director's reasonable discretion, and that eliminates the substantial risk as reasonably determined by the filming committee.
(c)
Where the substantial risk is imminent as reasonably determined by a filming committee member and is identified after the commencement of filming, the applicable filming committee member may place a stop work order on the filming if it finds that the order will likely alleviate the substantial risk. The stop work order may be issued without advance notice where the filming committee member deems that a delay of the order will jeopardize public health and safety, and shall be lifted as quickly as possible after the risk is eliminated. The filming committee shall notify the director of the stop work order within two hours of its issuance. The director and filming committee shall employ reasonable efforts to consult with the producer and identify permit changes that are mutually acceptable to the producer and the city, that will minimize the length and impact of the stop work order as decided by the producer, and that remedy the health/safety issue(s) as determined by the filming committee.

Changes made to the permit pursuant to this subsection 11-437(3) shall not require payment of a change fee.
(4)
Where the director, or a filming committee member in consultation with the director, determines that the producer is violating material term(s) of the permit, the director shall decide the appropriate remedial actions after consulting with the filming committee and the producer. If the director and/or filming committee find that a substantial public health or safety risk is arising from or caused by the material violation, the filming committee in consultation with the director may place an immediate stop work order on the filming without prior notice to the producer, and consultation with the producer shall occur after the work stoppage. The consultation between the director, filming committee member and producer shall evaluate the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was intentional, whether permit modifications should be made, whether the stop work order should be lifted (where applicable), and what other actions should be taken (if any). Where the violation creates a substantial public health and/or safety risk, the remedial actions decided by the director will not be deemed final until the filming committee reviews the remedial actions and confirms that they will eliminate the health and safety risks.

There is no charge for modifying a filming permit where the director reasonably determines that the modification is not material. For purposes of this article XXVI, "material" means that processing the requested change will require an expenditure of city staff time or services that is more than de minimus.

There is no charge for a material change to a filming permit where a completed change request is submitted to the department more than five (5) business days prior to the effective date of the permit. Where a material change is requested after the permit has taken effect, there will be no charge if the completed change request is submitted to the department more than five (5) business days prior to the implementation of the requested change.
(iii)
If a change request for a material change is submitted to the department five (5) or fewer business days prior to the effective date of the permit or the implementation date of the change, as described in subsection 11-440(2)c.(ii) above, the applicant must pay a change fee.

Regardless of whether a new filming permit fee is owed, the department shall determine whether a change fee is applicable based upon the timing of the change request and the standards set forth in subsection 11-440(2)c. above.
(iii)
A filming permit fee is refundable if cancellation is required because of extraordinary circumstances for which the producer is not responsible and which are not within the producer's control.
