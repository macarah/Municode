1.
General policy. Conditional Uses are neither absolutely permitted as a matter of right nor prohibited in particular zoning districts. Such uses of property may be permitted as generally compatible with the zoning district, but not in every location therein, nor without certain standards or other requirements or conditions met. Uses which require a conditional use permit are potentially incompatible with other uses usually allowed in the particular district or particularly incompatible with nearby or contiguous districts.
2.
Conditional Uses shall be authorized only upon making a finding that the application conforms to all of the requirements of the designated zoning district requirements.
3.
Standards for review. Special emphasis shall be placed on the justification for the proposed use at the proposed location and how the proposal relates to and affects neighboring properties. Therefore, the commission and the council, on appeal, shall consider among other matters, the statement of general policy stated above and the following:
a.
Compliance with the City of College Park's zoning ordinance.

The character and use of buildings and structures adjoining or in the vicinity of the subject property.

Impact of the proposed use on nearby properties, including existing and possible future uses.
e.
Impact of the proposed use on public facilities, utilities and public infrastructure.
f.
Appropriateness of the proposed use as related to the city's land use plan.
g.
The number of persons residing, studying, working in or otherwise occupying buildings adjoining or in the vicinity of the subject property.

Materials of combustible, explosive or inflammable nature to be sold, stored, or kept on the premises.
k.
Protection of occupants of adjoining and surrounding buildings from noise, dust, gases, pollution.

n.
Adequacy of the site in terms of protecting and screening nearby properties from adverse impacts which might result from the proposed use.

The number, size, and type of signs proposed for the site.
p.
The amount and location of open space on the site.

Adequacy of ingress and egress to the property.
t.
Impact of the proposed use on the property values of surrounding properties at the uses for which the surrounding properties are presently being used.
4.
Conditional approval.

The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize, only in the specific cases of height and size of structures, buffers, yard requirements, parking, fences, pools, and accessory buildings, such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter in the district in question. Such variance may be granted, in an individual case, upon a finding by the Board of Zoning Appeals that the following exists:
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question, because of its size, shape or topography;
2.
The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship;
3.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;
4.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter and the city Comprehensive Plan text, however, no variance may be granted for a use of land, building, structure that is prohibited by this chapter;
5.
A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are allowed; and
6.
