Sec. 5-242. - Property owner prohibited from being absent from premises.
It shall be both unlawful and a nuisance, as regulated by section 8-2 of this Code, for any property owner, or tenant, or both as the context might dictate, to be absent from the premises upon which a swimming pool is constructed for a period of thirty (30) days, or more, without either draining said pool of all water or installing and maintaining a tight fitting protective cover over the surface of the pool. All gates in the fence surrounding the swimming pool shall be securely locked so that they cannot be opened from the outside.
For the purposes of this section, "absent from the premises" shall mean that no responsible adult lives on or about the premises.
Persons violating this section may be punished as provided in section 1-8, or the nuisance may be abated as provided in section 8-2, or the city may pursue both remedies.
