ARTICLE 4. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT

4.1 - Purpose.
The purpose of the Planned Development Zoning District is to encourage innovative approaches to site planning and land development. A planned development ("PD") is a professionally planned residential or commercial district or an integration of such uses fostering design flexibility and diversity. PDs are intended to achieve economies in land use, public improvements and services delivery while preserving open space and protecting natural areas. The PD encourages large scale, unified development of compatible land uses, accessed by intermodal circulation systems.
4.2 - Types of Planned Developments.
Two (2) types of Planned Development Districts accommodating primarily residential or nonresidential uses are created as follows:
1.
PD-R Planned Development Residential: The PD-R District is intended to accommodate primarily residential uses, with nonresidential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses.
2.
PD-C Planned Development Commercial: The PD-C District is intended to accommodate primarily nonresidential uses, with residential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses.
4.3 - Standards for Consideration of a Planned Development.
A.
Any property meeting the standards of this Article may be zoned as a PD, provided that all of the following conditions exist:
1.
A combination of principal land uses, not otherwise permitted within the same zoning district, is proposed for development on one (1) or more adjacent tracts.
2.
Variances concerning required development standards, or other regulations of the College Park Zoning Ordinance, would otherwise be necessary to achieve design flexibility.
3.
Environmental design (i.e., architectural standards and site development standards) proposed is of a higher quality than would be possible under regulations otherwise applicable to the property.
4.
Economical provision of public services will result.
5.
The resulting transportation system will encourage and facilitate pedestrians and bicycles as practical alternatives to the proliferation of motorized vehicles.
B.
In addition, two (2) or more of the following objectives must be met:
1.
Diversity in the range of permitted uses and variety in the relationship of uses, structures and open space in developments planned as cohesive unified objects.
2.
Preservation of natural features.
3.
Enhanced functional and beneficial use of open space.
4.
Creation of a variety of housing types compatible with surrounding neighborhoods, resulting in a greater choice of environments and dwelling units.
5.
Provision of attractive and appropriate locations for business uses in well-designed buildings with provision of employment opportunities near residential areas.
4.4 - Maximum Area of Commercial or Service Uses in PD-R Districts.
In PD-R Districts in which commercial or service uses are permitted, the acreage of land devoted to commercial or service uses, including structures, parking, and related characteristics and accessory uses thereto shall not exceed thirty-five (35) percent of the total area. Provided, however, that such percentage shall apply only to commercial and service uses, and not to other nonresidential uses such as schools, parks, community buildings, and public facilities. Required parking for commercial and service uses shall be counted towards the maximum percentage.
4.5 - Permitted Uses.
The applicant may propose various integrated uses, such as neighborhood commercial services, within a residential area. The planning commission shall determine the appropriateness of such proposals during the preliminary development plan review process. An approved development plan for a PD shall establish the requirements for guiding development and uses of property within the PD, subject to the following provisions:
1.
All uses in the R-1, R-2, R-3, MF, BP, and OP Districts are permitted in any PD. M-1 uses proposed for a PD-C shall be considered as conditional uses.
2.
Mixed-use or integrated use areas may be permitted provided that buffers as established in this Article are maintained. Proposed uses must be specified in the preliminary and final development plans, and, once approved by the planning commission and mayor and council, the final development plan shall govern development within the district.
3.
Multifamily uses shall not be located along the perimeter of a PD, except where adjacent to, or across a street from, an existing multifamily or more intense use. Multifamily units shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of the total number of dwelling units in a PD-R.
4.6 - Density.
A.
The density for single-family detached residential development in PD-R Districts shall not exceed six (6) units per acre, and the density for multifamily, residential development in PD-R Districts shall not exceed twelve (12) units per acre. Residential project density shall be calculated by considering only land designated for residential development, together with associated and adjacent common open space and recreation areas. Areas classified as drainage or retention facilities shall not be considered as common open space. Density shall be calculated by dividing the number of units by number of acres designated for residential development. Density shall be calculated separately for each housing type. Notwithstanding the above, net density ratios in excess of those provided by this subsection may be approved, provided the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed density is compatible with the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and the residential character of surrounding development in College Park, or that negative impacts will be mitigated through landscaping, site design or other techniques.
B.
The lot coverage, regarding building footprint, for development in PD-C District not within the Downtown Historic District shall not exceed sixty-five (65) percent.
C.
In the Downtown Historic District no lot coverage limitations apply; provided that open space and parking are met.
4.7 - Building Height.
Building height shall not exceed three (3) stories or thirty-five (35) feet, whichever is greater, unless a conditional height zoning permit is granted.
4.8 - Development Standards.
Development standards for any PD, including lot area, site dimensions, required yards, density, site coverage, landscaping and parking shall be explicitly proposed by the applicant and be approved by the mayor and council, provided such proposal does not fall below the standards of this Article.
A.
Minimum tract size. The minimum size for any PD shall be ten (10) acres.
B.
Public facilities. The applicant shall demonstrate that adequate public facilities will be provided to serve the PD. Such facilities at a minimum shall include, but not be limited to, water supply, sewage disposal, drainage control, roads, sidewalks and bike lanes. Any extension of public facilities shall be designated to avoid inefficiency, duplication, premature extensions, and unnecessary public costs. The applicant shall be solely responsible for installation of these public facilities in conformance with city standards and at the applicant's expense; provided that where such PD encompasses a portion of an Urban Redevelopment Area established by the mayor and council pursuant to the Urban Redevelopment Law, the city may elect, at its sole discretion, to joint venture in the cost and/or installation of public facilities where it determines such action is necessary to facilitate redevelopment of a blighted area.
C.
Underground utilities. PDs must include underground installation of all utilities, including, at a minimum, telephone, electric power and cable television in both public and private right-of-way, except when extreme conditions of underlying rock or other conditions make this requirement unreasonable.
D.

Individual project phases must be whole and complete and maintain a workable, functioning and efficient relationship throughout the PD. No phase shall be approved which is dependent upon any future phase for road access, public facilities or services, parking or common open spaces.
4.9 - Design Criteria.
Design criteria shall be used as the principal tool in evaluating the merits of a proposed PD. The burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed development plans comply with each of the following criteria, or alternately, to demonstrate that one (1) or more of these criteria are not applicable, or that a practical solution consistent with the public interest and other purposes of the College Park Zoning Ordinance has been achieved:
A.
Conformance to the Comprehensive Plan. The proposed development plan shall conform to applicable elements of the College Park Comprehensive Plan and city goals and policies expressed therein and elsewhere.
B.
Compatibility with surrounding development. Proposed uses, activities and densities shall have a compatible, efficient and functional interrelationship to surrounding uses and activities, and shall not adversely affect future development of the surrounding area.
C.
Development scale. Any nonresidential uses in a PD-R shall be of a scale primarily to meet commercial and service needs generated within the PD and those of the immediate area. Large-scale, retail uses which will draw patrons and/or vehicle trips primarily from communities outside College Park are discouraged. Market studies and traffic impact analyses may be required of the applicant as evidence that the proposal meets this criterion.
D.
Environmental design. Site plan, building design and location, and open space provisions shall be designed to produce a development that is responsive and sensitive to natural features and the aesthetic quality of the community. Site planning and design shall minimize any required cut or fill to afford maximum protection of natural landforms and features. Natural features and/or geologic hazards that may affect the property on which the PD is proposed shall be identified and mitigation measures established. Building design shall maximize preservation of vegetation and landforms, enhance drainage and minimize soil erosion. Developments must consider designs for foot traffic and pedestrian movement in and among individual retail and office establishments that facilitate destination environments for shoppers and employees. The following design principles shall control development in the PD:
1.
Non-retail commercial buildings shall, to the extent possible, front directly onto the public sidewalk and provide direct pedestrian access thereto.
2.
Site access for vehicles shall be configured such that pedestrians are not required to traverse parking areas or vehicular drives to approach the entry. Pavement markings identifying pedestrian walks may be used to achieve this design standard.
3.
All buildings shall provide direct pedestrian access from on-site parking areas as well as the public sidewalk system.
4.
All retail commercial buildings must front directly on the sidewalk, adhering to a zero front yard setback and forming a generally uniform edge identifying the retail commercial storefronts. A front yard having a maximum depth of twenty (20) feet may be approved, provided pedestrian or patron amenities are featured within the front yard.
E.
Intermodal transportation. The intent of the PD is to plan a hierarchy of streets, walks and paths that equitably serves the needs of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. All PD proposals shall accommodate alternative transportation modes, including mass transit, bicycle and pedestrian options. This shall include the design of a pedestrian and bikeway system, including such facilities as lighting, landscaping, signs, benches, paved surfaces, and bike racks.
F.
Architectural standards. An architectural design plan which ensures architectural consistency in the proposed development, architectural character, and preservation or improvement of the visual character of the city shall be provided and, upon approval, shall form part of the plan. Architectural character is based upon the suitability of a building for its purposes, the appropriate use of materials, and upon principles of harmony and proportion of the building with other proposed buildings and surrounding land uses. Buildings or other improvements shall be compatible with the orientation, directional emphases, shape, volume, massing, proportion, rhythm, scale and materials of the context, setting and streetscape of the site. Architectural elements, designs, concepts, building styles and materials shall be subject to review by a design review commission as established by the city to ensure consistency with the purposes and provisions of the PD. In the absence of a design review commission, architectural review shall be by a committee composed of the City Planner, building inspector, downtown development manager, director of development and city manager.
The following requirements shall control building construction in the PD:
1.
Building materials used for exterior finishes shall consist of glass; metal; brick; stone; concrete stucco; decorative concrete block; solid wood; "Hardy" board or similar masonry applications; or similar, durable architectural materials. Pre-fabricated metal buildings, metal storage sheds, synthetic stucco, "dryvit", EIFS, vinyl siding and other materials found to be other than durable products are specifically prohibited. Awning materials shall be limited to canvas or metal.
2.
Roof pitch in residential developments shall be a minimum of 6/12. Roof materials shall consist of asphalt or composite shingles, terra cotta, slate, cedar, or standing seam metal. "Rolled" asphalt-roofing materials shall not be used.
3.
Side and rear building elevations of attached, residential developments and all commercial developments shall be substantially consistent with the front building elevation.
4.
Architectural style within one (1) block or other contiguous development unit shall be compatible and shall adhere to a single, consistent architectural theme.
5.
Placement of air-conditioning units, satellite dishes in excess of one (1) meter in diameter and other mechanical systems and equipment shall be accomplished without detracting from the architectural integrity of the building or site. Generally, such equipment must be installed to the rear of the building or on the side, provided the view is partially obstructed through either the use of screening compatible with the building such equipment serves or landscaping. Rooftop equipment shall be completely screened from view from the public right-of-way as well as adjoining properties.
G.
Access for the disabled. All buildings intended for use by the general public shall be designed and constructed so that they are accessible and useable by physically disabled individuals. Site development and building construction shall conform to specifications set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
4.10 - Common Open Spaces.
Common open spaces shall be defined for the purpose of this section as the total area of land and water within the external boundary of a PD designated and intended for use and enjoyment as open areas, and not improved with a building, structure, street, road or parking area, except for recreational structures and parking for recreational uses. Said common open spaces shall not include individual lots and yards located between buildings and parking areas.
A.
Minimum open space requirement. A minimum of twenty (20) per cent of the area of the PD-R District (fifteen (15) per cent of PD-C Districts), net of all street rights-of-way, parking areas, and the below listed areas of this subsection, shall be common open spaces. Acreage delineated by utility easements containing overhead lines shall be factored into neither the calculation of the common open space reservation, nor the net area of the PD.
B.
Ineligible areas and uses. No area within a building site (other than recreation structures), road and road easement or right-of-way, cut or fill slope, drainage facility such as detention ponds, or other permanently disturbed area shall be credited toward the required per cent permanent, common open space requirement. Recreational uses which alter the natural landscape, and are not available to the general public, such as golf courses, shall not constitute more than fifty (50) percent of the minimum twenty-five (25) or fifteen (15) percent common open space reservation.
C.
All common open space shall be reserved for its intended purpose as shown on the approved, final development plan. The common open space shall either be dedicated to the city, subject to acceptance by the City of College Park, or administered by a nonprofit organization, subject to the requirements of this Article.
D.
All common open space shall be specifically included in the development schedule, and be constructed and fully improved by the owner at an equivalent or greater rate than construction of all other structures proposed in the approved final development plan.
E.
Areas proposed for common open space or recreation areas shall be allocated among the various land uses in proportion to the ratio of neighborhood or employment population to total PD population so that acreage devoted to open space and recreation is reasonably accessible to all residents and daytime occupants of the PD.
F.
Civics spaces in all PDs, including public squares and parks which feature focal points such as fountains, public artwork and other amenities designed for passive recreation, must be incorporated into common open spaces. No residence in a PD-R shall be located more than five hundred (500) feet from a common open space area comprised of a minimum area of one-quarter (Â¼) acre.
4.11 - Purpose.
A.
Variations from the standards provided in the College Park Subdivision Regulations for streets, lots and blocks must be approved, provided it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineering Director that each of the following objectives will be met:
1.
Safe and convenient access will be provided to dwelling units, nonresidential areas, community facilities and common open space within the PD;
2.
Adequate access and circulation for emergency and city service vehicles will be provided; and
3.
Principal vehicular access points will be designed to permit smooth traffic flow and minimum hazards to vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
B.
No private streets are permitted within a PD.
4.12 - Transportation System.
Access routes and circulation within the PD shall be designed to minimize the length of roadways and to eliminate conflicts between vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic. The system shall incorporate intermodal transportation elements, and shall be controlled by the following provisions:
A.
Access to public thoroughfares. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to permit smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Minor streets within the PD shall generally not be connected to streets outside the development, except where an existing street grid already exists, it shall be maintained and no access to adjacent areas shall be discontinued.
B.
Site accessibility. PDs shall normally be located on a street having a minimum functional classification of "collector." All proposed streets, alleys and driveways shall be adequate to serve the residents, occupants, visitors, emergency and service vehicles, and other anticipated traffic of the PD. Every dwelling unit, or other land use permitted in the PD, shall have access to a public street either directly or through an approved driveway, pedestrian way, or other means dedicated to public or private use.
C.
Emergency access. No structure or use shall be inaccessible to emergency vehicles or as otherwise allowed as determined by fire chief.
D.
Alleys. Alleys may be approved provided a minimum paved width of twenty (20) feet is maintained. All alleys shall conform to construction standards adopted by the City of College Park.
E.
Pedestrian ways. Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling units, appropriate facilities within the development, and principal off-site pedestrian destinations. Walkways that are suitably located, designed and constructed may be combined with other easements and used by city emergency and service vehicles, but shall not be used by other vehicles. All pedestrian facilities shall conform to the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
F.
Intermodal circulation. The final development plan shall provide for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation within the PD. This may be accomplished through the design and construction of sidewalks and pathways, bike lanes or other means to ensure the safe and efficient movement of such alternate transportation modes as bus, shuttle, automobile, bicycle and walking. These routes shall be designed to connect to existing or future routes adjoining the PD.
G.
Traffic management. The PD is intended to control vehicular traffic speeds and minimize conflicts between motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. Use of "traffic calming devices", such as landscaped medians, rotaries, "on street" parallel parking and defined pedestrian crosswalks must be incorporated into the proposed street system.
4.13 - Relationship Between Planned Developments and Zoning Districts.
A.
PDs shall be permitted throughout the city.
B.
Except as modified by this Article and approved in a final development plan, elements in a PD shall be governed by the regulations of R-3 District with respect to single-family housing, and the MF District with respect to townhouse, condominium, and apartment development. Commercial development elements shall, unless modified by and approved in a final development plan, conform to the requirements of this Article, or where in the absence of standards in this Article, the standards of the OP District.
C.
The final development plan for the PD may provide for such variations from district regulations established in subsection B. governing use, density, area, bulk, setbacks, parking and signs, and such subdivision regulations as may be necessary or desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed PD, provided such variations are consistent with the standards and criteria contained in this Article and have been specifically requested in the application for a PD, and further provided that no modification of the district requirements or subdivision regulations may be allowed when such proposed modification would result in any of the following conditions:
1.
Inadequate or unsafe access to the PD;
2.
Traffic volumes exceeding the planned capacity of the proposed major street network in the vicinity such that the level of service (LOS) falls below an LOS rating of C;
3.
An undue burden on schools, fire and police protection, and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the PD; or
4.
A development which will be incompatible with the purposes of the College Park Zoning Ordinance or the Comprehensive Plan.
4.14 - Planned Development Conditions of Approval.
The applicant for zoning map amendment to a PD, by requesting the PD designation and making application therefore, shall agree to furnish information about the proposed development, and later to abide by certain conditions and safeguards as may be imposed by mayor and council in establishing such developments. To that end, the regulations set forth herein are minimum requirements, and it is the intent of this section that the owner(s) or their agent shall establish in their development plan standards and conditions, and mayor and council may impose conditions and safeguards in excess of, or in addition to, the specific requirements set forth herein. The guarantee of meeting the minimum requirements set forth herein does not create an entitlement to such an amendment, where the mayor and council determine that it would be contrary to the public health, safety and welfare to establish such a district through analysis of the standards of review.
4.15 - Qualification of the Applicant.
An application for approval of a PD may be filed by any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity having a contractual interest in the property for which the development is proposed, or a contract to purchase or option to purchase an interest in the property, or their authorized agent, hereafter referred to as "applicant;" provided that where a PD is proposed for property included in an Urban Redevelopment Area approved by the mayor and council, an applicant may propose for inclusion in the PD property over which the applicant holds no direct control. In such instance, development of the plan shall meet all standards of this Article as well as all requirements of the Urban Redevelopment Act. With the exception of land included in an Urban Redevelopment Area, final development plan approval by mayor and council shall not be issued until the applicant provides satisfactory evidence of ownership of all property to be included in the PD.
4.16 - Planned Development Approval Process.
