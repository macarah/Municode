Sec. 42-4. - Loitering.
(a)
A person commits the offense of loitering when he is in a place, without authority or permission to be in such place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.
(b)
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer fails to comply with the foregoing procedure, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern. Repeated incidents of parking or standing on private property by a person after being previously warned by an officer to leave, without authority or permission to remain on such property and without any legitimate purpose or business related to the private property, shall be considered circumstances that would warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm for the safety of the property. Littering and the use or distribution of controlled substances shall both be considered acts which would violate the safety of persons or property.
(Ord. of 10-1-1984, §§ 1, 2)

Secs. 42-7—42-35. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - CURFEW

Sec. 42-36. - Findings.
Based upon demonstrated experiences of the city and other urban counties and municipalities, and upon evidence presented to the mayor and council by city councilmen and the police chief of the city, who are familiar with conditions resulting from minors being on or about the streets and other public places unsupervised between the hours of midnight and 5:00 a.m. and the conditions resulting from such unsupervised activity, the mayor and council of the city take note that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, morals and preservation of the citizens of the city to provide for a curfew article. It is the intent of this curfew article to protect minors from one another and others while they are out on the streets and other public places, to enforce parental control of and responsibility for their children, and to protect the public from the nocturnal mischief or criminal activity of minors. The city finds that a curfew ordinance will promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interest such as reducing criminal activity, protecting against property devaluation and deterioration and eliminating undesirable community conditions and that such article will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech, expression or travel. To that end, this section is hereby adopted.
(Ord. of 9-8-1997)
