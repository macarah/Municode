ARTICLE IV. - NONCONFORMING USES

Sec. 42-93. - Continued.
(a)
Within the zoning districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there exists: lots, structures, uses of land and structures; which were lawful before the resolution from which this chapter is derived was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(b)
Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of the resolution from which this chapter is derived.
(c)
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of the resolution from which this chapter is derived. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-94. - Nonconforming lots of record.
(a)
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the resolution from which this chapter is derived, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
(b)
If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of the resolution from which this chapter is derived, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-95. - Nonconforming structures.
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the resolution from which this chapter is derived that could not be built under the terms of this chapter due to restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1)
No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
(2)
Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
(3)
Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-96. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination.
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the resolution from which this chapter is derived, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1)
No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
(2)
If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the mayor and council either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the mayor and council may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(3)
Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
(4)
When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. The intent, and any evidence thereof, of any owner and/or user of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, to discontinue or abandon the use shall be irrelevant in determining whether discontinuance or abandonment shall be based upon such objective evidence as would lead a reasonable observer of actual use of the structure, or structure and premises in combination, to believe that discontinuance or abandonment of the use has in fact occurred.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-97. - Repairs and maintenance.
(a)
On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
(b)
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
