DIVISION 2. - APPLICABILITY

Sec. 16-537. - Applicability.
This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 16-514. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law and approval or exemption from these requirements does not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations.
(Ord. No. 07-04, § 1(art. XI, div. 2(38-520)), 5-14-2007)
Sec. 16-538. - Grandfather provisions.
This article shall not apply to the following activities:
(1)
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(2)
Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities, including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements.
(3)
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.
(4)
Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.

This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (a)(1) of this section.
(3)
Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived takes effect or approved under the terms of this article.
(4)
Within an easement of any utility existing at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures.
(5)
Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the city manager on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the city manager or his designee to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
(6)
Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silviculture or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
a.
After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities.
b.
Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 16-541.

(2)
An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
(3)
No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or setback.
(Ord. No. 07-04, § 1(art. XI, div. 2(38-524)), 5-14-2007)
Sec. 16-541. - Variance procedures.
Variances from the buffer and setback requirements set forth in section 16-540 may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:
(1)
Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city manager finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city manager may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided that such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel.
(2)
Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the city manager shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city manager. The city manager shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city manager shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road of right-of-way.
(3)
Variances will be considered only in the following cases:
a.
When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted.
b.
Unusual circumstances would create an extreme hardship.
(4)
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.
(5)
At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information:
a.
A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;
b.
A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
c.
A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;
d.
Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained;
e.
At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible;
f.
A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion;
g.
A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and
h.
Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed.
(6)
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
a.
The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
b.
The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
c.
The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
d.
Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
e.
The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and
f.
Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.
(Ord. No. 07-04, § 1(art. XI, div. 2(38-525)), 5-14-2007)
Sec. 16-542. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements.
(a)
This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
(b)
Examples of existing legislation and regulations as of July 2002 include:
(1)
The Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan;
(2)
DNR Part 5 Criteria for small (under 100 square miles) water supply watersheds; and
(3)
