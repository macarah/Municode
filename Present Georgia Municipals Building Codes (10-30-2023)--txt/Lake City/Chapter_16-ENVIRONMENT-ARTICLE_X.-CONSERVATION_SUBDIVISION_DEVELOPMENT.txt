ARTICLE X. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 16-579. - Purpose.
(a)
The purpose of conservation subdivision development is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the city by allowing flexibility in the design of certain subdivisions from standard regulations in exchange for the dedication and protection of open space and for other benefits to the public welfare.
(b)
The specific purposes of a conservation subdivision development include:
(1)
To provide residential subdivision regulations which permit and encourage flexibility of design in order to preserve environmentally sensitive areas and create efficient uses of the land;
(2)
To preserve open space and unique or sensitive natural resources, such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, wildlife habitats, historic features and unique topography;
(3)
To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount or infrastructure, including paved surfaces, utilities, earthwork and other land disturbing activities;
(4)
To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential developments;
(5)
To conserve a portion of the otherwise developable property as open space in perpetuity. This option is not necessarily intended to allow an applicant to conserve only the portion of the tract that is already not buildable due to factors such as steep slopes, wetlands, or land adjacent to undesirable areas such as landfills or livestock farming;
(6)
To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the city;
(7)
To promote linking of greenways and corridors between the city and neighboring jurisdictions;
(8)
To encourage interactions of persons living in the resulting residential community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood;
(9)
To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries;
(10)
To incorporate aesthetic design standards that will increase the value of the neighborhood;
(11)
To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by promoting views of open space from arterial and collector roads; and
(12)
To promote other purposes of the zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations, soil erosion and sediment control ordinance and other ordinances and policies of the city.

Sec. 16-580. - Permitted locations and districts.
(a)
Conservation subdivisions, as defined herein, are permitted within the all one-family residential zoning districts. The zoning administrator shall receive all applications for a conservation subdivision on such form as prescribed by the zoning administrator. An application shall include a proposal which will demonstrate compliance with all applicable county regulations regarding the approval of subdivisions as well as the regulations set forth in this article, except as otherwise authorized by this section. The regulations found in this section are optional insofar as it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to determine if conservation development is appropriate for use on a particular piece of property and thereafter apply for approval.
(b)
An applicant shall tender a conceptual plan to the zoning administrator who shall make a preliminary determination of the general outlines of the subdivision. If the conceptual plan is approved, the applicant will then prepare a preliminary plat, which, if consistent with the conceptual plan, shall serve as the plan for the proposed development.
(c)
The mayor and council shall have final approval or denial of all applications for conservation subdivisions. Such applications shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for zoning amendments are processed. In making such decisions, the mayor and council shall be guided by the standards set forth in section 16-579. The permitted uses allowed shall be the same as those listed in chapter 42, pertaining to zoning.
(Ord. No. 07-05, § 1(art. XII(38-571)), 5-14-2007)
Sec. 16-581. - Dimensional requirements for conservation subdivisions.
The development standards for conservation subdivisions shall be as follows:
(1)
The minimum lot size shall be 7,000 square feet.
(2)
The minimum front setback shall be 20 feet from the property line, unless otherwise approved by mayor and council.
(3)
The minimum side yard shall be the minimum required by the city fire code.
(4)
The minimum rear yard setback shall be 25 feet from the rear property line.
(5)
The minimum lot width shall be 70 feet, unless otherwise approved by mayor and council.
(6)

Sec. 16-582. - Density restrictions.
The maximum gross density of development in this district shall be based on the zoning district in which the property is located, except as modified elsewhere in this article. Further, the maximum gross density of development shall be based upon the gross acreage before the same is reduced by the 25 percent open space requirement.
(Ord. No. 07-05, § 1(art. XII(38-573)), 5-14-2007)
Sec. 16-583. - Subdivision design.
Proposed conservation subdivisions shall be processed in the same manner as a standard subdivision plat is processed. An approved final plat shall have an additional letter "C," symbolizing the use of conservation design standards, affixed after the original zoning designation listing. Conservation subdivisions to be considered for approval shall meet the following minimum design standards:
(1)
A minimum of 25 percent of the total land area (open space) shall be permanently protected as described elsewhere in this article. A minimum 20 percent of the total protected land area shall be otherwise suitable for development, be located substantially throughout the subdivision, and adjoin as many lots as is reasonably practical. The land area within any buffer required in subsections (4) and (5) of this section and land in utility and right-of-way easements may be included in calculating the minimum 25 percent open space requirement.
(2)
All homes must have, at least, all front facades constructed with brick, stone or stucco, or a combination thereof.
(3)
No vinyl siding, except for eaves and soffits, shall be used. All exterior surface facades, except for eaves and soffits, shall be constructed with a masonry-based material.
(4)
A 50-foot buffer shall be maintained along all arterial streets and a 25-foot buffer shall be maintained along all collector streets. The buffer shall be natural, planted vegetation, and/or earthen berm, as approved by the zoning administrator; provided, however, that a minimum of a 25-foot vegetated buffer shall be maintained along all external streets.
(5)
A 75-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained on each side of all perennial streams as may otherwise be required by the appropriate state regulatory agency. All buffers should be expanded to include wetlands, steep slopes or the 100-year floodplain. At least part of the buffer must be maintained with native vegetation.
(6)
All dedications, easements, or other specific measures required to be performed to meet the regulations set forth in this section shall be shown on a final recordable plat prior to the issuance of a building permit on any lot of the subdivision.
(7)
Front, side and rear yards, where disturbed, shall be sodded.
(8)
No rear yard fences shall be erected across any drainage or access easements.

Sidewalks shall generally slope toward front yards rather than roadways.
(13)
Unless otherwise approved by mayor and council, sidewalks are required to be constructed on both sides of the street.
(14)
The maximum driveway widths shall be as follows: nine feet (one lane), 18 feet (two lanes).
(15)
Shared driveways may be permitted with approval of mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 07-05, § 1(art. XII(38-574)), 5-14-2007; Ord. No. 2016-4, § 2, 4-11-2016)
Sec. 16-584. - Conservation protection implementation.
An applicant for a conservation subdivision development shall submit a written management plan for the project and its open space areas prior to the approval of the final plat. The management plan shall include:
(1)
Provisions for the use, restrictions of use, ownership, maintenance and perpetual preservation of the open space areas;
(2)
Allocation of responsibility and establishing guidelines for the maintenance and operation of the open space and any facilities located thereon. These guidelines must include provisions for ongoing maintenance and for long-term capital improvements if any;

Record title may be held by:
1.
Equal share of undivided interest by each lot owner;
2.
The homeowners' association; or
3.
Other entity or arrangement approved by the city manager.
b.
Conservation easement may be held by:
1.
The city; or
2.
Other entity approved by the city manager, qualified to be a holder under the Georgia Uniform 1 Conservation Easement Act.

Sec. 16-585. - Standards for determining open space.
(a)
The minimum area of open space preserved shall be determined by multiplying the total acreage of all lands included in the development by 0.25. The result shall constitute the minimum amount of area that must be preserved as open space.
(b)
Physiographic characteristics. The types of land area included in the open space may include the following:
(1)
Floodprone areas, floodplains, and floodway;
(2)
Wetlands;
(3)
Ponds, lakes, stream and river channels, including buffer zones of approximately 100 feet or more (but never less than 25 feet) from the top of the streambanks on both sides;

(10)
Areas of historical or archeological significance;
(11)
Cemeteries; and
(12)
Other similar areas which are less suitable for development.
(c)
The open space should be designed to be, in part, an integrated part of the project rather than an isolated element. The entire project should include elements of design and development that make at least a part of the open space an amenity to the development.
(d)
The amenity portions of the open space should be designed to be directly or easily accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access (minimum of ten feet) to the open space.
(e)
Where practicable open space areas shall also be configured to provide a buffer between adjoining property outside the conservation subdivision and the home sites within the subdivision. Excepting approved fences and signs, a 50-foot setback shall be maintained between structures and the exterior boundaries of the subdivision.

Sec. 16-587. - Quality construction density bonuses.
(a)
Prior to the approval of the final plat, the subdivider may choose to implement construction standards cumulatively, as listed in subsection (b) of this section, and receive the appropriate density bonus. The maximum total of all density bonuses used shall not exceed 35 percent. The density bonus percentage shall be applied to the density (units per acre) requirements as set by the mayor and council. Quality construction standards implemented by the subdivider shall be noted as a requirement on the final plat.
(b)
Allowable density bonuses include the following:
(1)
Sidewalks installed on both sides of internal streets, and installation of sidewalks along external abutting streets shall merit a six percent density bonus.
