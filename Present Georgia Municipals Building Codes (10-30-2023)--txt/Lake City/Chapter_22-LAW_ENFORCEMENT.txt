False alarm means any accident or occurrence wherein a private alarm system of any type is activated by any cause and which summons any public officer to the location of the alarm or which causes any public officer to begin traveling en route to the location of the alarm, when there in fact exists no emergency or other condition requiring the presence of such officer.
