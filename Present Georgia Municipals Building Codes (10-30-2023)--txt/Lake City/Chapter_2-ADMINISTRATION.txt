Sec. 2-56. - Purchasing principles.
(a)
Generally. The following principles are to apply to the procurement of materials, services and supplies:
(1)
Materials, services and supplies are to be purchased only when moneys for their cost have been appropriated in the annual budget for the city.
(2)
Materials, supplies and equipment should be purchased through the state department of administrative services (DOAS) or under state contract when available.
(3)
Materials, services and supplies not available through DOAS or under state contract are to be purchased according to the procedures in section 2-55.
(4)
All other considerations being equal, bids shall be awarded on price, service and delivery. Bid items must meet specifications in all cases to qualify. The city has the right to accept or reject all bids.
(5)
Whenever possible, long-term contracts or blanket purchase agreements should be obtained for supplying commodities such as gasoline or other items for which monthly or periodic requirements can be forecast. The office of purchasing agent shall make monthly checks to ensure that the party under contract is not escalating his delivery price beyond current market.
(6)
Low bid quotation submitted in compliance with the specifications should be accepted unless rejected by a change in the requirements of the city or for other valid stated reasons and approved by mayor and council. Whenever this occurs the reason should be filed with bids.
(7)
Request for quotation as well as sealed bids should have a set time, date and location given by the office of purchasing agent when tabulation of bids will be made and this shall be done at the time and date specified.
(8)
Emergency purchases are the result of breakdown in equipment or other occurrences for which it is impossible to plan in advance. If the occasion arises during the hours of normal operation contact the purchasing agent and he may make the purchase or authorize the department head to do so. If an emergency arises after hours the department head will make the purchase and contact the purchasing agent the next working day and immediately send a memorandum explaining the emergency.
(9)
Emergency purchases should apply to guidelines of section 2-55.

(b)
Purchase methods. The purchasing procedures to be followed by the city are based on the dollar amount of the purchase and are as follows. These procedures apply on a per-item basis and purchases will not be divided or separated to avoid obtaining proper approval for purchasing.

The purchasing agent and the department head make recommendation to the mayor and council. The mayor and council award the contract for purchase. The results of bids and award are to be recorded and filed.
(5)
For budgeted vehicles: direct purchase from state contract, by department heads with purchasing agent and city manager approval.

(c)
Purchase orders. All purchases and requests for purchase shall be memorialized and consummated through the use of purchase orders.

(2)
The purchase order is the vendor's authorization to invoice and ship the material specified. It is also designed to expedite and control buying for the city.
(3)
Routing of the purchase order. The purchase order set contains the original and two copies.
a.
White copy or original copy (marked vendor) is mailed or given directly to the vendor.
b.
Pink copy (file) is retained in the office of purchasing agent to be encumbered until all items listed are received. The invoice is attached to the purchase order to be entered through accounts payable for payment. In case of back-ordered items a copy of the purchase order shall be made as needed after each invoice has been attached until all items are received.
c.
Yellow copy (departmental) is for the ordering department for their records.
It is imperative that the receiving department submits to the purchasing office a signed document that goods or services have been received; otherwise no payment will be made to the vendor. A signed document may be a packing slip or delivery ticket sent by the vendor or, if none is sent, the receiving department may simply list goods or services received or make a copy of the purchase order and note that all goods have been received. In all cases documents must be signed by the person receiving goods or services and the department head. In case of damaged goods, unsatisfactory service or the item was not what was ordered, the receiving department must notify the office of the purchasing agent immediately.
