Sec. 42-213. - SCR Shopping Center Reuse District.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of the SCR Shopping Center Reuse District is to allow the repurposing of an existing development of land to provide for a wide range of retail, service and wholesale establishments. It is the intent of the mayor and council that this district be utilized by owners and developers of existing developments, currently configured for a market that no longer exists, so as to allow them to subdivide the property into ownership interests that can be bought and sold on the open market. The anticipated use of this district shall allow the reuse of economically distressed strip malls and shopping centers, with significant unused parking areas, to be subdivided into smaller fee simple interests that can be used by smaller retailers and other businesses. While there are no front or side yard setbacks, the fundamental requirement of this district is that all lots must have frontage on a public street, which street shall, in all respects, meet the minimum requirements of street construction for streets to be dedicated to the city. In zoning properties to this use, the mayor and council should be expected to treat each individual proposal as unique, and may attach additional conditions related to the property including, but not limited to, landscaping, use of common areas, parking requirements, setbacks, permitted uses, and other such common zoning requirements, so as to allow maximum flexibility to fashion a result which balances the interests of the owner/developer with those of the public.
(b)
Permitted uses. Any use permitted in the G-1 district shall be permitted in the SCR district.
(c)
Accessory uses. Accessory uses in the SCR district shall be those determined by the zoning administrator to be customarily appurtenant to those uses permitted in the SCR district.
(d)
Conditional uses. Any conditional use permitted in the G-1 district shall be permitted in the SCR district.
(e)
Space limits. The following limits apply only to existing developments in the SCR district:
(1)
Minimum lot area: None.
(2)
Minimum lot width: 20 feet.
(3)
Minimum front yard: none.
(4)
Minimum rear yard: 25 feet.
(5)
Minimum side yard: none.
(6)
Maximum building height: 35 feet.
(7)
Maximum ground coverage: none.
(f)
Miscellaneous provisions. The following miscellaneous provisions apply in the SCR district:
(1)
All lots must have the minimum lot width on a public street, which street meets minimum city standards. This section may not be utilized for new vertical development not existing on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, there shall be no minimum parking requirements. Prior to the subdivision of any existing lot pursuant to this section, the owner thereof shall submit to the city attorney sufficient proof that reciprocal easements and reciprocal covenants will be attached to all parking and drive areas so as to insure the adequacy of parking and of common area maintenance. No building may be enlarged without the consent of the mayor and council.
(2)
For purposes of compliance with the sign provisions of article XVII of this chapter, all parcels contiguous to property any other property within this zoning classification shall be treated as one planned center.

Parking located between the front of any commercial building and the public right-of-way in the G-1 district shall be limited to a maximum of 25 percent of the required parking. Such parking shall not be located in front of the building entrance or in a manner that blocks a direct pedestrian path from the building to the public right-of-way. Gasoline service stations, convenience stores, parking lots and parking garages which constitute nonconforming uses are exempt from this entire subsection.
(3)
Parking requirements for developments which are located within 400 feet of a municipal or private parking area may be reduced by one-half, provided sidewalks link such parking areas directly to the main entrances of all buildings on the site.
(4)
All parking facilities in the G-1 district shall be landscaped in conformance with design guidelines, and all portions of such parking facilities bordering the public right-of-way shall be screened with an appropriate screening device as specified in the design guidelines, except those at gasoline service stations, convenience stores, car dealers, parking lots and parking garages that constitute nonconforming uses.
(5)
All paved surfaces shall be considered as parking areas whether or not identified by striping. Parking areas in excess of ten percent of the minimum requirement shall be subject to approval by the design review commission.
(6)
Gasoline service stations, convenience stores, car dealers and parking lots or parking garages that are in existence at the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall operate as nonconforming uses in G-1 district and are specifically exempted from subsections (g)(2) and (4) of this section.
(7)
Insofar as possible, all required parking for Gateway Village shall be located on the interior of parcels in a courtyard configuration, limiting parking area frontage on public rights-of-way and reducing the visibility of those areas, and apparent size from public rights-of-way.
(h)
Utilities.
(1)
All electrical, cable, telephone and other such services shall be installed underground.
(2)
All transformers and other facilities and equipment, including telecommunications equipment shall either be screened through the use of architectural materials compatible with the architectural materials present on the site or, alternatively, through landscape screening.

(3)
Sign illumination, where direct or indirect, shall not exceed 75 footcandles; provided, however, that signs with dark surfaces may require lighting in excess of 75 footcandles. The design review commission may approve such increases upon demonstration that in the absence of excess lighting the sign cannot be properly viewed. In no case shall the permitted candle power exceed 100 footcandles.
(k)
Transportation networks.
(1)
General organization. The street system shown in the plan is organized on the scale of the traditional city block (generally, about 400 feet by 400 feet) in order to permit efficient automobile circulation and create a viable pedestrian environment. The streets are grouped into three categories: primary routes, secondary routes and neighborhood streets. Jonesboro Road (U.S. Highway 54) is the only primary route in the village area. Secondary routes are Main Street (presently CCSU Avenue) Huie/Harper Road, North Lee Street, Kenyon Road and Forest Parkway. Neighborhood streets shall be used to divide the blocks into smaller, more accessible areas.
(2)
Redundant modes and routes. Redundant modes of transportation and routes may be designed to provide travelers with diverse choices for movement throughout the district.
(3)
Pedestrian priority. Village nodes will be located at the crossing of major thoroughfares. These nodes will be designed to provide safe, convenient pedestrian access. Pedestrian travel shall be emphasized over vehicular travel in the nodes. The pedestrian system should be:
a.
Spacious. Sidewalk widths should be adequate for the planned volume of pedestrians, and street furnishings and utility structures may not be placed so as to interfere with movement. Sidewalk widths shall be a minimum of five feet wide in residential areas and eight feet wide in commercial areas.
b.
Comprehensive. The sidewalks shall link travelers to all points in the village and to destinations nearby (CCSU, the Reynolds Nature Preserve, and associated bikeways).
c.
Buffered. Sidewalks and crosswalks shall be designed so that they are buffered from traffic and clear of obstructions.
d.
Lighted. Sidewalks and crosswalks shall be lit so that they may be safely used during evening and night hours.
(4)
Traffic calming. Motorists will be encouraged to travel through the village at moderate velocities and to negotiate intersections more carefully than they normally do in suburban situations by use of traffic calming devices such as landscaped medians and flanking curb trees and shrubbery.
(5)
Parking. Designated parking on road shoulders shall be used where possible to reduce the amount of pavement needed. Curbside parking will be designed to create traffic buffers particularly along the front facades of businesses.
(l)
Application and review procedures.
