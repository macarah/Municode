ARTICLE VII. - EXCEPTIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ENCROACHMENTS

Sec. 42-173. - Height exceptions; general rule.
Any structure hereafter erected or altered shall comply with the height limitations of the zoning district in which it is located, except as specified herein.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-174. - Structures excluded from height limitations.
The height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to church spires, belfries, flag poles, monuments, cupolas, domes, ornamental towers, nor to observation towers not intended for human occupancy, water towers, transmission towers, radio or television towers or aerials. These exclusions shall not apply in the vicinity of airports.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-175. - Lot area exception; existing platting.
(a)
A single-family dwelling may be built on any platted lot of record containing 75 percent of the required lot area for the district in which the lot is located if said lot was in separate ownership and separate control at the effective date of the resolution from which this chapter is derived, provided the front, side and rear yard requirements for the district in which the lot is located are met and provided dwellings are permitted in the district in which the lot of record is located. It is not the intention of this exception to allow building as a matter of right on a platted parcel which was never intended as a building site, but rather was numbered on a plat for identification purposes under a scheme in which multiple lots were intended to provide one building site.
(b)
In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width one-family dwelling, the mayor and council is hereby authorized to grant a variance reducing the side yard requirements for such lot the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling, but in no case shall each of the side yards be less than five feet in width.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-176. - Group projects.
In the construction of group projects (residential, commercial, industrial, educational, medical, religious and civic) where two or more buildings are to be placed on a plot of land not subdivided into customary streets and lots and which will not be so subdivided, the mayor and council shall determine the distances that shall be necessary to allow sufficient space between buildings and from adjoining property lines, taking into consideration appearance, play area, fire safety, traffic patterns and flow, parking and buffer zones, planted or otherwise. This provision is made to give the mayor and council flexibility in determining front, rear, and side yard requirements in such group projects. However, the maximum lot coverage by buildings in such projects shall never exceed the requirements of the zoning district in which such project is located.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 01-02, § 5(8.4), 7-9-2001; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-177. - Temporary buildings.
A temporary building, sign, or buildings for use in connection with a construction project or land subdivision development shall be permitted on the land of the project during the construction period. Temporary buildings related to a subdivision development shall be removed when 80 percent of all lots are occupied by completed homes or within four years, whichever occurs first.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-178. - Fences and hedges—Corner visibility.
Except in districts allowing the construction of buildings or structures to the property line, there shall be provided an unobstructed view across the triangle formed by joining points measured 20 feet distant along the property line from the intersection of two streets or 15 feet along both the street and alley line from the intersection of a street and an alley. Within said triangle, there shall be no sight-obscuring wall, fence or foliage higher than 30 inches above grade or in the case of trees, foliage lower than eight feet. Vertical measurement shall be made at the top of the curb on the street or alley adjacent to the nearest side of the triangle or if no curb exists, from the edge of the nearest traveled way.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-179. - Same—Exception.
The mayor and council may approve, or may direct as a condition for granting rezoning approval, that fences or plantings of a height in excess of these regulations be placed as buffers between different uses, or between like uses upon agreement between the parties affected thereby, provided that no such approval shall have the effect of reducing corner visibility as provided for herein.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-180. - Structures to have access.
Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street, or with access to an approved private street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, and required off-street parking.
(Code 1994, § 110-1; Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 5-13-2002)
Sec. 42-181. - Parking, storage, or use of major recreational equipment.
For purposes of these regulations, the term "major recreational equipment" includes boats and boat trailers, travel trailers, pickup campers or coaches (designed to be mounted on automotive vehicles), motorized dwellings, tent trailers, and the like, and cases or boxes used for transporting recreational equipment, whether occupied by such equipment or not. Such major recreational equipment may be parked or stored in side yards or rear yards or in a carport or enclosed buildings; provided, however, that such equipment may be parked anywhere on residential premises for a period not to exceed 24 hours during loading or unloading. In the case of a corner lot, no vehicles may be parked or stored in the side yard on the street side of the lot. No such equipment parked or stored on a residential lot, or in any location not approved for such use.

Sec. 42-182. - Parking and storage of certain vehicles.
