ARTICLE IV. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION DISTRICT

Sec. 14-76. - Overlay.
The water supply watershed protection district shall overlay other zoning districts so that all land lying within the water supply watershed protection districts shall also be included in the underlying district(s). Each parcel of land within the water supply watershed protection district shall be subject to the provisions, regulations, and restrictions of both the water supply watershed protection district and its underlying district(s). In the event of a conflict or discrepancy between the requirements of the watershed protection overlay and the underlying district(s), the more stringent shall apply.
(Ord. of 10-20-98(1))
Sec. 14-77. - Findings of fact.
In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a health economic climate within the county, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threaten the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(Ord. of 10-20-98(1))
Sec. 14-78. - Purpose.
The purpose of the water supply watershed protection district regulation is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the county. It also minimizes the transport of pollutants and sediments to the water supply and maintains the yield of the water supply watersheds.
(Ord. of 10-20-98(1))
Sec. 14-79. - District delineation.
The protected water supply watershed districts are hereby designated and shall consist of the land areas that drain to the public water supply intake or water supply reservoir. The boundaries of these districts are defined by the ridge lines of the respective watershed and the boundary of a radius seven (7) miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes. These districts shall be further delineated and defined on the water supply watershed protection district overlay map of the Monroe County official zoning map, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this article by reference.
(Ord. of 10-20-98(1))
Sec. 14-80. - Permitted uses.
All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by the article except for those listed in prohibited uses below are permitted in the water supply watershed protection district, are subject to the following conditions and standards:
(a)
Natural buffer requirements.
(1)
Within a seven-mile radius upstream of the public water intakes, a natural buffer, one hundred (100) feet wide, shall be maintained on both sides of the stream, measured from the stream banks. Similarly, outside the seven-mile radius, a natural buffer of fifty (50) feet shall be maintained on both sides of the stream.
(2)
A natural buffer shall be maintained for a distance of one hundred-fifty (150) feet from the boundary of any existing or future water supply reservoir.
(b)
Impervious surface limitations.
(1)
No more than twenty-five (25) percent of the land area of any parcel or lot on which new development is placed may be covered by impervious surface within a designated water supply watershed protection district.
(2)
Within a seven-mile radius upstream of all public water intakes, no impervious surface shall be constructed within a one hundred-fifty-foot setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
(3)
Outside a seven-mile radius upstream of all public water intakes, no impervious surface shall be constructed within a seventy-five-foot setback area on both sides of the stream, as measured from the stream bank; and no septic tanks or drainfields are permitted within the seventy-five-foot setback area.
(4)
Septic tanks and the drainfields of septic tanks are prohibited in the setback areas of subsection (2) above.
(Ord. of 10-20-98(1); Res. of 9-7-99)
