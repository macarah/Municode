Sec. 18-17. - Shareable dockless mobility devices.
(a)
Findings. Dockless electric scooters and bicycles, available to be rented on demand from unstaffed locations, have suddenly and unexpectedly appeared in municipalities throughout the country, and have rapidly proliferated in an unregulated environment without adequate safeguards for the individual users or the greater community. Frequently, they are abandoned by users on streets, sidewalks and other public places creating safety concerns, especially for vulnerable and disabled pedestrians. Due to the spontaneous appearance of these rentals and their appeal to young people, shareable dockless mobility devices are nearly always operated by users—often minors—without helmets, in contravention of state law, which has resulted in injuries to operators of these devices.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prohibit shareable dockless mobility devices from being placed in the public right-of-way or on public property, operated in the public right-of-way or on public property, or offered for use anywhere in the city. This will allow for adequate pedestrian traffic flow and will protect the traveling public until additional regulations may be established through a franchise or licensing system to safeguard the community and establish a pilot program to test the operation of these devices within the city in a controlled and safety-conscious manner that ensures compliance with all local and state laws.
(c)
Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms, phrases, words, and their derivatives shall have the meanings set forth in this section.
(1)
Shareable dockless mobility device means any dockless wheeled device, whether it be human-powered, electric, or otherwise motorized, that permits an individual to move or be moved freely, including but not limited to, a bicycle, scooter, or skateboard; is accessed via an on-demand portal, whether a smartphone application, membership card, or similar method; is operated by a private entity that owns, manages, and maintains devices for shared use by members of the public; and is available to members of the public in unstaffed, self-service locations.
(2)
Dockless means that the device does not require the individual user to return and lock the device to an authorized fixed station once the user has completed their use of the device.
(d)
General requirements. It is unlawful to park, leave standing, leave lying, abandon, or otherwise place a shareable dockless mobility device in a public right-of-way or on public property anywhere within the city. It is unlawful to operate a shareable dockless mobility device in a public right-of-way or on public property anywhere within the city. It is unlawful to provide or offer for use a shareable dockless mobility device anywhere within the city.
(e)
Violations; impoundment. Violations of this section shall be punishable as provided for in section 1-10 of this Code. Police officers, parking enforcement officers, code enforcement officers, those city officials otherwise designated by the manager, and any party contracted by the city to specifically impound shareable dockless mobility devices are authorized to impound any shareable dockless mobility device that has been offered for use, placed in a public right-of-way or on public property, or operated in a public right-of-way or on public property in violation of this section. The impoundment shall be subject to an initial impound fee and a daily storage and administration fee, as applicable, as provided in the schedule of fees adopted by city council.
(1)
Once a shareable dockless mobility device has been impounded as provided for in subsection (e), the city or a designated officer shall make a good-faith attempt to determine the name and address of the owner of such device by serial number, vehicle identification number (VIN), or such other means as are reasonably ascertainable through inspection of the exterior of such device. In those cases where the name and address of the owner of the subject vehicle are determined, written notice shall be sent to said owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service acknowledged by signature of the registered owner or other responsible party. Notice by certified mail as described herein shall be deemed given as of the postmark date. The written notice required by this section shall contain the following:
a.
A description of the subject vehicle, including serial numbers, vehicle identification number, or other identifying information;
b.
The name and address of the owner of such vehicle;
c.
The dates and descriptions of the parking violations that establish the grounds for impoundment, the unpaid amounts of the civil penalties for each violation, and the process by which the device(s) may be reclaimed. A copy of each parking ticket or other document providing the required information attached to the notice shall be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. Where multiple devices owned by the same company are impounded on a single day, a single notice listing all impounded devices is sufficient;
d.
A date and time at least seven (7) days from the postmark date of the notice in which the registered owner or other responsible party may appear in the city municipal court to demand a bench trial to contest the impoundment.
(2)
Vehicles towed and impounded under subsection (e) may be released from such impoundment only upon payment in full of all impound and storage fees accrued.
(3)
Shareable dockless mobility devices that are not reclaimed within one hundred twenty (120) days of impound pursuant to the procedures outlined in sub-paragraph (2) shall be deemed at that time to be abandoned and discarded by the owner thereof and shall thereafter be disposed of pursuant to written policies established by the manager.
(f)
Severability. If any section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this section or the application thereof to any person or place, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the final decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall be and remain in full force and effect.

(5)
Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit of the marked school zone shall be evidenced by photographically recorded images.
