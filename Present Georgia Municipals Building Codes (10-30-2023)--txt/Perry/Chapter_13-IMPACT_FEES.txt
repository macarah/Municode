Sec. 13-36. - Computation of development impact fee.
(a)
(1)
At the option of the developer, the amount of the development impact fee may be as per the provisions of subsection (2) below or may be determined from the fee schedule established by the city as follows:
EXPAND
Land Use Fire Impact Fee
Residential
Commercial/institutional
Manufacturing/industrial As established by the mayor and council for each land use category
  (2)
If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed uses, the fee shall be determined according to the fee schedule established by the city by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied for is not specified on the fee schedule, the director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The director shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the reports and studies done by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and/or the state, and/or the city department of public works, and/or professional organizations such as the American Society of Civil Engineers.
In the case of change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit, the development impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. The director shall be guided in this determination by the above-named sources.
(b)
If a developer elects not to have the development impact fee determined according to subsection (a), above, then the developer may apply for an individual fee determination. A developer applying for an individual fee determination shall prepare and submit to the director an individual fee calculation study for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The individual fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats for the study established by the director, or, subject to the prior approval of the director, such other professionally accepted methodology that identifies a project's proportionate share. The developer shall attend a pre-application meeting with the director and no agreement or understanding in regard to data, assumptions or methodology shall be binding upon the city unless provided to the developer in writing. The service demand documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the individual fee calculation was made, including, but not limited to the following:
(1)
Documentation demonstrating the impact of the proposed development activity on the following city-provided services:
a.
Public safety:
1.
Fire.
b.
Parks.
(2)
Engineering or any other suitable report(s), study or documentation depicting service demands or city-provided services appropriate for the proposed development activity.
(3)
Cost documentation studies including documentation of the cost per unit of impact for construction and documentation credits attributable to the development activity which can be expected to be available to replace the portion of the service volume/demand generated by the development activity.
This documentation shall be prepared and presented by qualified professionals in their respective fields and shall follow best professional practices and methodologies. The following formula, as explained in the methodology report, shall be used by the director to determine the development impact fee per unit of development based on the type of land use:
[Unit Cost x Demand] - Credit = Proportionate Share
Whereby:
Unit cost = The average cost per unit of capacity to provide infrastructure or facilities within the service district.
Demand = The average volume/capacity or demand expected to be utilized by a given land use on an annual basis.
Credit = The average present value of future payments by a land use towards the retirement of debt incurred to construct facilities and infrastructure.
The director shall provide the developer with a written individual fee determination within thirty (30) days after presentation of the individual fee calculation study.
(c)
(1)
Upon application to the director, any person engaging in development activity requiring payment of a development impact fee may apply for and shall receive from the director a certification of the application of the development impact fee schedule to a particular development activity proposal or a certification of an individual fee determination for a particular development proposal.
(2)
Applications for certification shall include the following information items:
a.
A full and complete description of the project;
b.
A full and complete description of the proposed land use and the particular proposed development activity;
c.
A statement as to whether the applicant seeks a certification of the development impact fee schedule as applied to that particular development proposal or a certification of an individual fee determination; and
d.
If the applicant seeks a certification of an individual fee determination, an individual fee calculation study complying with the requirements of subsection (b) above.
(3)
The director shall provide an applicant with a written certification of the application of the development impact fee schedule to a particular proposed development activity within five (5) days after the director's receipt of a completed application. The written certification of the director shall establish the development impact fee for a particular proposed development activity for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of certification. The director shall provide the applicant with a written certification of an individual fee determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of a completed application. The individual fee determination certified by the director shall establish the development impact fee for the one hundred eighty-day period immediately following the date of such certification. Notwithstanding the issuance of any such certification, any changes in or additions to the proposed development activity different from the particular proposed development activity identified in the original application shall be subject to increased or additional development impact fees to the extent that such changes or additions require capital improvements or facilities expansions. The additional development impact fees shall be based upon the most current development impact fee schedule in effect on the date of the issuance of a building permit.
(d)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, prior to engaging in development activity generating demand and impacting city-provided services, and in addition to any other applicable requirements, the developer shall certify in writing to the director:
(1)
A full and complete description of the project;
(2)
A full and complete description of the proposed land use or uses; and
(3)
A statement of the gross square footage applicable to each category of land use.
Prior to the completion of the project, and as a condition of final inspection, the developer shall recertify in writing to the director the actual land use or uses of the project, and shall present an architect's certificate of the actual gross square footage attributable to each use. In the event that the actual use or uses and/or the actual gross square footage applicable to the actual use or uses differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the development impact fee was previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a condition of final inspection. The amount of the excess shall be based upon the most current development impact fee schedule in effect on the date of final inspection.
