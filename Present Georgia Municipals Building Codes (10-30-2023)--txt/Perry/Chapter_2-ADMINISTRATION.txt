ARTICLE IV(a). - ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE POLICY

Sec. 2-150. - Policy statement.
It is the position of the city that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is the number one health problem in the United States today. The costs involved with this problem include lost jobs, morale problems, injuries, illnesses, and deaths, as well as economic costs such as property damage, tardiness, absenteeism, lost productivity, increased health insurance costs, and the costs involved in replacing and retraining new employees.
The use of alcohol and controlled substances by the city employees while on the job constitutes a direct threat to property and the safety of others. The work involved in many positions is inherently dangerous, and the safety of citizens and fellow employees depends upon the ability of employees to think clearly with unimpaired faculties.
It is the objective of the city to provide safe and effective public service. To meet this objective, the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse must be identified, confronted and defeated. In order to achieve this, the city has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy. This policy consists of three (3) interrelated programs: (1) An employee education/supervisor training program; (2) an employee assistance program (EAP); and (3) an alcohol and controlled substance testing program. Although these programs cost money to implement, they should prove to be cost effective if they eradicate alcohol and controlled substance abuse among all employees. The city considers its employees to be its most valuable resource, and sincerely wishes to assist its employees with any alcohol or controlled substance related problems they might have. As used in this policy, the term "controlled substance" shall have the meaning and include the substances defined as "controlled substances" in the Georgia Controlled Substance Act, O.C.G.A. § 16-13-20, et seq., and especially O.C.G.A. § 16-12-21(4) as said section and said Act shall appear from time to time.

(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 2, 3-16-04)
Sec. 2-152. - A procedural guide to the city alcohol and controlled substance policy.
A.
Introduction. The problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Although controlled substance abuse continues to receive a large amount of attention from the news media, alcohol remains the biggest substance abuse problem in the American workplace.
It is likely that some of these individuals are employed by the city. Although it would be pleasant to assume that all employees never break the law, or report to work under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, such an "ostrich-like" approach ignores the fact that substance abuse is a major public health problem. This problem must be squarely dealt with. Employees abusing alcohol and controlled substances are more apt to be involved in accidents, and have a higher absentee rate than non-abusers. To combat this problem the city has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy that shall apply to all employees.
B.
Overview of the alcohol and controlled substance policy. The alcohol and controlled substance policy of the city is made up of three (3) separate but interrelated programs:
1.
An employee awareness/supervisor training program;
2.
An employee assistance program (EAP);
3.
An alcohol and controlled substance screening test program.
The overall responsibility for the alcohol and controlled substance policy lies with the program manager. (See attachment F.) Drug tests and any other expenditures for program costs will be cleared through and approved by the personnel director and the city manager. Although it was already prohibited for an employee of the city to be "under the influence of alcohol and/or nonprescribed drugs on the job," this alcohol and controlled substance policy was developed to prevent illicit use of alcohol or controlled substances by city employees without violating the legal rights of those employees. In order to do this, it is necessary that supervisors at every level within the city understand the policy, follow the policy, and give the policy their full support. This will lead to greater acceptance and understanding of the policy more easily attained.
The policy has five (5) primary goals. These are:
(A)
Prevention. To prevent the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances by the city employees.
It is universally accepted that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is destructive. Yet many individuals start or continue these habits because they lack reliable information about devastating effects of alcohol and controlled substance abuse. The policy seeks to educate the employees about the facts behind substance abuse so that they can see the potential effects of this behavior. This should help prevent employees from developing alcohol or controlled substance-related problems. The policy also seeks to educate and motivate the "nonusing" coworkers so that they will encourage employees to seek help. Peer group pressure can be an extremely powerful force.
The policy also seeks to communicate to the employees the fact that the city is concerned about alcohol and controlled substance abuse among its employees, and that the city will do everything within its power to prevent such abuse.
(B)
Cost effectiveness. To combat the abuse of alcohol and controlled substance in a way that is cost effective.
Although alcohol and controlled substance abuse is recognized primarily for its "human" costs, the economic costs associated with the problem are also unacceptable. Properly instituted, the policy will increase worker productivity, and decrease absenteeism, accidents, and health care costs.
As a good many of the workers affected by the policy are in safety-sensitive positions, the policy will also help decrease the changes of the city being held legally liable for acts committed by an impaired employee.
Finally, the policy should improve employee retention rates, thereby lowering employee "turn-over" costs such as hiring and training new employees to replace those who have quit or have been terminated due to alcohol and controlled substance abuse.
(C)
Clear communication of city's policy. To clearly communicate the position of the city regarding the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances.
The policy seeks to effectively communicate to each employee and the general public the position that alcohol and controlled substance abuse will not be tolerated among employees of the city. Employee awareness of this position and of the mechanisms to enforce this position should act as a deterrent to substance abuse. Additionally, awareness on the part of employees may encourage those who believe they might have a problem to seek assistance. Awareness of the provisions of the policy should lead to greater compliance with the policy by all employees.
Furthermore, publicity about the policy should act to increase public respect for the employees of the city. Implementing such a policy reassures the citizens that city employees are not entitled to a double standard, that they do in fact obey the law, and that they will continue to serve as role models for citizens of all ages. The policy will also reassure the public that city services paid for by tax dollars are the safest and most effective services available.
(D)
Provide assistance to alcohol/controlled substance dependent employees. To provide assistance to employees who need it.
A chemically dependent individual is not able to control his/her alcohol or controlled substance intake. The policy recognizes this fact by providing for discretionary department director referral to the employee assistance program. (See attachment F.) This in not a device for the employee to use to "get around the rules". Rather, the decision to terminate or to refer to the EAP is to be made in accordance with this policy.
The decision to terminate an employee is a drastic one, with personal, economic, and possible legal consequences.
It is not a decision to be made lightly. If an employee has exhibited substance dependence, it may be more beneficial to the city and the employee to present that employee with a "firm choice" between rehabilitation or termination. Most experts agree that a substance abuser must face a "firm choice" before a rehabilitation program can succeed. This is not to say that all employees violating the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be given a "firm choice". If an employees' policy violation does not involve evidence of alcohol/controlled substance dependence, there would be no reason to refer the employee to EAP.
(E)
Legal method of control. To provide a legal means to employee control.
One of the challenges facing the city is to devise a way to test employees for alcohol or controlled substance use that would withstand legal challenge. It is necessary for the city to control its employees as it may be held liable for injuries to coworkers or the public caused by impaired employees. At the same time, the city employees have rights that need to be protected. The policy balances these two interests, by stating precisely what is expected of the employees, as well as explaining what will happen should a violation occur.
C.
Specific guidelines on policy administration. The preceding section of this guide discussed some of the general considerations behind the alcohol and controlled substance policy. The next section of the guide will provide practical assistance in implementing the three (3) programs within the policy.
1.
Implementing the alcohol/controlled substance awareness program. The basic idea behind this program is that employee alcohol/controlled substance abuse can be prevented by supplying the employees with information about the problems alcohol/controlled substance abuse can create. The awareness program is subdivided into two (2) sections, an employee education section to include all city employees and a supervisor training section.
The city will work with local resources to provide instruction and materials for training programs. Awareness services are provided by various hospitals, clinics, and organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous.
The employee education section will provide:
a.
Educational seminars;
b.
Questionnaires at both the start and the completion of the program (to chart belief/knowledge changes);
c.
Audiovisual programs;
d.
Group discussions;
e.
A presentation of what a treatment program is, what it does, and how to take advantage of one; and
f.
A description and discussion of the city alcohol and controlled substance policy.
The supervisor training section will focus on the important role supervisors have in preventing alcohol/controlled substance abuse. This program will include:
a.
Instruction in identifying warning signs of alcohol/controlled substance abuse by employees;
b.
Role-playing scenarios;
c.
Group discussions;
d.
First-line supervisors and upper-level supervisors, during which first-line supervisors should be assured of the support they will receive should they intervene with a problem employee; and
e.
A thorough presentation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy, with particular emphasis placed upon the procedural requirements involved with disciplining employees.
2.
Implementing the employee assistance program.
a.
The employee assistance program. The reference point and clearing house of the EAP will be the Houston Health Care Complex. The EAP will be provided with proper resources to interview employees and refer them to appropriate rehabilitation/treatment programs. The EAP office will not be located in the department of personnel. Employees will be hesitant to avail themselves of the EAP if it appears adverse employment action will be taken against them, in spite of the employer assurance to the contrary.
The confidentiality of the records of the coordinator will be assured to further promote employee trust and confidence in the EAP. For purposes of statistical reporting, names and dates will not be released. However, the coordinator will have the authority to sideline an employee who has informed the coordinator that he/she is presently impaired. The notion of confidentiality does not give an impaired employee the right to continue working simply because he/she accessed the EAP. In such a situation, the coordinator will seek a "disability leave" or some other type of action that will not label the employee as an alcoholic or drug user.
b.
Employee's completion of EAP. If an employee must take time off to take part in a rehabilitation program, the absence will be treated as sick leave, annual or leave without pay for seniority purposes.
If the employee was referred to the EAP by his department director or his designee, upon returning to work, the employee will be subject to unannounced alcohol/controlled substance screening tests for a period of twelve (12) months. These tests will be administered approximately every three (3) months, with an emphasis on post-weekend (Monday) testing. However, an element of surprise must be retained, so a fixed schedule will not be established. Management should refrain from directing the administration of more than one (1) screening test per month, unless the circumstances clearly require more frequent testing.
c.
Financing the EAP. An outside EAP professional will be utilized as the EAP coordinator at no charge. The cost of the rehabilitation programs themselves will be covered as any other medical problem by the employee's health insurance.
3.
Implementing the alcohol and controlled substances screening test program.
a.
Establishing necessary test procedure. The first step in implementing the screening test program will be to provide employees proper notice. Copies of the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be distributed to each affected employee through in-house orientation programs within each department and bulletin board postings.
After policy distribution has occurred, the city will establish a professional relationship with a quality laboratory certified through NIDA-DHHS.
The city will establish the procedure involved with the collection of samples. Samples will be collected at the alcohol testing laboratory/agent or drug testing collection agency (see attachment F); samples will not be collected at the workplace. The samples will be carefully checked and marked with the name of the employee, the date the sample was collected, and the location where the sample was collected. A chain of custody/control will be established so that samples are properly handled before testing occurs. Every effort must be made to assure that the sample being tested is the sample actually collected from the employee/applicant in question.
When testing for alcohol, the standard Breathalyser used for DUI suspects is sufficient. The city policy is that, any alcohol content (BAC) level indicates policy violation. The employee has the right to request a blood test if he/she so desires. This test will be conducted at the employee's expense.
Although some laboratories have their own policies, the city will establish which chemical tests are to be performed on the urine samples. For controlled substance testing, urine samples will be used, and the presence of foreign metabolites in urine will indicate a violation of this policy.
However, alternatives such as blood tests and hair analysis may be interpreted as more intrusive, and may be used if necessary.
There are a variety of chemical tests that can be performed on urine samples to detect controlled substance abuse. The most widely used technique is called immuno-assay technique. The immuno-assay technique has a high degree of reliability under "optional" conditions, but can produce, in certain cases, false positive rates. The manufacturers of the leading immuno-assay counsel that every positive immuno-assay test should be confirmed by another more elaborate and expensive test method.
The confirmatory methods include thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Ideally, all samples that test positive should be confirmed with one of the three (3) confirmatory techniques.
Finally, in establishing necessary test procedures, the city will decide which substances are to be tested for. The Official Georgia Code Annotated lists over one hundred ninety-three (193) controlled substances, the possession or use of which is illegal. The cost of individual tests for each substance would probably be prohibitive. Additionally, urinalysis tests are directed at drug use and do not detect alcohol in the bloodstream. Thus, the city will establish testing for alcohol by use of the Breathalyser, and the use of urinalysis to detect controlled substances such as marijuana (THC), cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, etc.
b.
Issues and procedures involved with testing. Testing will begin upon implementation of this policy. The alcohol and controlled substance policy provides for testing in five (5) different situations:
(1)
Pre-employment for employees in safety-sensitive positions of sworn police personnel, trained firefighter, police reserve officers, utility employees handling gas service, city drivers and operators of heavy equipment.
(2)
The "reasonable suspicion" test;
(3)
Following accidents of any employees involving property damage or personal injury;
(4)
Random testing when employed in safety-sensitive positions which include sworn police personnel, trained firefighters, police reserve officers, utility employees handling gas service, city drivers and operators of heavy equipment.
(5)
Random testing upon return to work after participating in a rehabilitation program.
(A)
The pre-employment test.
(1)
During the final interview process the job applicant for safety-sensitive positions will be provided with a copy of the "pre-employment consent and notice" form.
(2)
At that time, the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be explained to the applicant and the pre-employment consent and notice" form will be signed by the applicant.
(3)
Should the applicant refuse to sign the consent form, the application process will continue. On the application it will be noted only that the applicant "refused test". It will not mention suspected alcohol or drug use by the applicant. The applicant has the right to refuse to consent to the test, but the city has the parallel right to refuse to hire the applicant.
(4)
Should an inquiry as to that specific application be made by the applicant or a third party at a later date, the city must be sure to protect the confidentiality of the application process. For instance, if another employer contacts the city in the context of the reference check, the only information that will be supplied is that the applicant did apply and that the applicant "failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment". It will never be revealed that the applicant refused to consent to an alcohol/controlled substances test.
(5)
If the applicant being considered for a position consents to the test and the test results are negative, the applicant will continue with the hiring process.
(6)
Should the test results be positive, the test must be confirmed. If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, the applicant will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will no longer be considered for employment. Inquiries to a specific application will be advised the applicant "failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment".
(B)
The test upon "reasonable suspicion".
(1)
The test upon "reasonable suspicion" involves a great deal of discretion on the part of the supervisory personnel.
(2)
The supervisor training program will provide precise guidelines as to what is involved with identifying a potential alcohol or controlled substance abuser. The task of identifying potential abusers does not include diagnosing a worker. The fact that a problem exists is all that is to be discussed when dealing with an employee.
(3)
When it is suspected that an employee has violated the alcohol and controlled substance policy, the employee will only be told that job-related problems have developed and that it is suspected that these job-related problems are the result of alcohol or controlled substance abuse. The underlying cause of such abuse should not be a concern of the supervisor.
(4)
The phrase "reasonable suspicion" means just that—a screening test should be administered if it is reasonable to suspect that an employee has violated the policy. A "suspicion" must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse, or other policy violations.
(5)
There are a few considerations to keep in mind before a test upon reasonable suspicion is administered. Thorough documentation of all steps of the investigation is a must. This will include such items as (1) memos to the personnel file of the employee, stating why a reasonable suspicion exists; (2) notes placed in the file stating the date and time of any discussions with the employee regarding substance abuse, and the employee's reaction; and (3) documentation of any evidence suggesting alcohol or controlled substance abuse.
(6)
In documenting the investigation, every effort will be made to assure the confidentiality of the case.
(7)
After it has been determined that a "reasonable suspicion" exists, the next step is to actually test the employee for the presence of alcohol and/or controlled substances.
(8)
The employee will be called into a private office, informed of the allegations of policy violation, and be requested to sign the "employee consent and notice" form.
(9)
If the employee refuses to consent to the testing, he/she will be allowed to leave the office.
(10)
If an employee consents to testing, he/she always has the option of taking a blood test at his/her own expense. This test must be under such circumstances to insure validity of the test.
(11)
The supervisor should not touch the employee at any time or attempt to coerce the employee into consenting to the screening test.
(12)
Upon the employee's refusal to consent, he/she may be disciplined. The employee may be terminated for insubordination pursuant to the procedure outlined in the personnel rules and regulations and the alcohol and controlled substance abuse policy.
(13)
If the employee consents to the screening test, and the confirmed results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances in the employee's system, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will be suspended without pay in accordance with this policy and the personnel rules and regulations.
(14)
If it is determined that a violation of the policy has occurred (the reasonable suspicion has been backed up by a positive confirmed screening test plus any other corroborating evidence of a violation), the employee may be terminated or referred to the EAP.
(15)
As a practical matter, the fact that the employee's alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse bad affected the employee's work performance to the degree that a reasonable suspicion was developed in the first place should be considered when deciding whether to terminate the employee or refer him/her to the EAP, in addition to the factors discussed earlier in this guide.
(16)
If the investigation reveals that the employee has not violated the policy, or if the evidence is ambiguous, the employee will be reinstated with back pay.
(C)
The testing following an accident of any employee which involves property damage or personal injury.
(1)
At the time a person is employed by the city, the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be explained to them along with city policies regarding accidents and the employee will sign the "employee consent and notice" form.
(2)
At the time an employee is involved in an accident, the employee will undergo a screen test.
(3)
The department head or his designee will contact the department of personnel to arrange for the employee to be taken to a city designated physician, medical facility, or police department for testing.
(4)
Should the employee be injured, the testing will be handled by medical personnel other than those treating the employee for injuries.
(5)
Should the test results be negative, normal city policy and procedure in dealing with accidents will be followed.
(6)
Should the confirmed test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substance, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and may be disciplined, in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations.
(7)
If there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee may be either (a) terminated, pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel rules and regulations; or (b) referred to the EAP by his/her department director.
(8)
If after the investigation has been completed, it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred, the employee will be reinstated with back pay to his/her former position and standard city policy in regard to accidents will be followed.
(9)
The individual's refusal to sign the consent form at the time of employment, may be grounds for nonhire. (Attachment A)
(D)
The random testing of safety-sensitive positions of certified law enforcement officers, firefighters, life guards, water/waste water plant operators, utility personnel handling gas service, all city employees assigned or expected to operate a city owned vehicle on public routes and all operators of heavy equipment.
(1)
The random testing of employees involves periodic testing of all persons authorized by the city to carry firearms or who are otherwise employed in safety-sensitive positions. The names of such employees will be drawn at random throughout the year. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the workforce will be tested annually.
(2)
Upon adoption of this policy, all employees holding these safety-sensitive positions will be requested to sign an "employee consent and notice" form.
(3)
Should the employee refuse to sign the consent form, the employee will be disciplined following the procedure set forth in the city personnel policy.
(4)
The employee may be terminated for "insubordination", pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel policy manual. The stated reasons for terminating an employee will never be "refusal to submit to urinalysis", but rather "insubordination" or "failure to follow the legitimate instructions of the supervisors" or a reason of similar language.
(5)
If the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative, the employee can return to work.
(6)
Should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, that test result must and will be confirmed.
(7)
If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol/controlled substances, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy, and will be disciplined in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations.
(8)
An intensive investigation into the employee's background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violations will take place. After investigation is completed, and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee will be either: (a) terminated, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the personnel rules and regulations; or (b) referred to the EAP by his/her department head or his designee.
(9)
If after the investigation has been completed and it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred (for example, if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of policy violations by requesting additional testing of the same urine samples or submitting to a blood test, the results of which are negative), the employee will be reinstated with back pay to his/her former position.
(E)
Testing following return to work after rehabilitation.
(1)
This random testing of employees follows their return to work after voluntary or department head referral for rehabilitation services.
(2)
At the time the employee enters into a rehabilitation program, the department head or the department of personnel is notified immediately by the employee or their representative.
(3)
Upon release from a rehabilitation program the employee will be subject to random alcohol and controlled substance screening tests for a twelve-month period.
(4)
Prior to returning to work, the employee will be requested to sign an "Employee Consent and Notice" form. Should the employee refuse to sign the consent form, the employee will be disciplined following the procedures set forth in the city personnel policy manual.
(5)
An investigation into the matter will be made. Following investigation, he/she may be terminated for "insubordination" pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel policy manual. The stated reasons for terminating an employee will never be "refusal to submit to urinalysis", but rather "insubordination" or "failure to follow the legitimate instructions of the supervisors" or a reason of similar language.
(6)
If the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative, the employee can return to work. However, should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, that test result must and will be confirmed.
(7)
If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol/controlled substances, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy, and will be disciplined, in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations.
(8)
An intensive investigation into the employee's background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violations will take place. After investigation is completed, and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee will be terminated pursuant to the procedures set forth in the personnel rules and regulations.
(9)
If after the investigation has been completed and it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred (for example, if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of policy violations by requesting additional testing of the same urine samples or submitting to a blood test, the results of which are negative), the employee will be reinstated with back pay to his/her former position.
D.
Other issues involving the policy.
1.
The duty to protect other employees and the public from impaired individuals. If it is discovered that an employee is impaired while working, the employee will not be allowed to drive home. After the necessary disciplinary procedures have taken place, the impaired employee should either be driven home, or a taxi should be called for the employee. If the employee is allowed to leave on his own in an obviously intoxicated state, it is possible the city or the employee's supervisors may be held legally liable for the actions of the employee.
2.
Discipline generally. The suspension or termination of an employee will never be justified on the basis that the employee is an alcoholic or substance abuser. The employee's physical/psychological state of being will not be mentioned when disciplining that employee. Instead, discipline will center around the employee's failure to meet objective, job-related criteria. "Substandard performance", "insubordination", "violation of policy", or "failure to follow orders" are examples of proper reasons for discipline. Supervisors are to remember—don't diagnose it, describe it.
3.
Employees' right to privacy. All meetings involving a violation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy should be on a "closed-door" basis, with admission restricted to those who have a legitimate interest in the proceedings. Under no circumstances will the proceedings be discussed outside of these closed-door meetings, nor will it ever be publicly stated that an employee is an alcoholic or controlled substance abuser. After disciplinary proceedings have taken place, inquires as to the reason for termination/suspension will be answered with an "objective" cause only ("insubordination", for example). The use of alcohol or controlled substances shall not be publicly attributed to an employee.

Sec. 2-153. - Alcohol and drug misuse prevention policy for pipeline employees
A.
Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to prevent accidents that result from the misuse of alcohol and drugs, thereby reducing fatalities, injuries and property damage; and to comply with the alcohol and drug testing standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and set forth in 49 CFR part 199. In the event that there is a conflict between the provisions of this policy and the alcohol and drug testing standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation or the requirements of 49 CFR part 199, the standards of the United States Department of Transportation and the terms and conditions of 49 CFR part 199 shall prevail.
B.
Scope of policy. This policy applies to every city employee who performs any function on a pipeline including operation, maintenance and emergency response. This policy also applies to any pipeline employees who are contractors or employed by contractors and compliance with each and every provision of this policy shall be required of each contractor. Any questions concerning this policy should be directed to the program manager listed in attachment F.
C.
Required testing.
1.
Pre-employment testing. A pre-employment drug test shall be conducted when an individual applies for a position which is covered by this policy. Any job applicant who refuses to submit to a pre-employment drug test or who has a confirmed positive test shall not be hired. An employee who transfers from one position covered by this policy to another position covered by this policy does not require pre-employment testing.
2.
Postaccident testing. Following an accident, the city will promptly test each surviving employee for alcohol and drugs if that employee's performance either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An accident for purposes of this policy means an incident reportable under 49 CFR part 191 involving gas pipeline facilities or LNG facilities, or an accident reportable under 49 CFR part 195 involving hazardous liquid pipeline facilities.
Any employee who is involved in an accident must remain available for alcohol and drug testing. Each employee who is requested to submit to testing shall do so within two (2) hours of the accident. Employees who have been involved in an accident may not consume alcohol for eight (8) hours following the accident or until an alcohol test has been conducted.
An employee who is subject to postaccident testing and who fails to remain readily available for such testing may be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. An employee who leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to an alcohol and drug test without first notifying the public gas system via his or her supervisor shall be deemed to have refused to submit to testing unless the employee left the scene to seek emergency medical attention or assistance in responding to the accident. If an employee who is subject to postaccident testing is hospitalized, the hospital or medical facility shall be asked to obtain samples for alcohol and drug testing.
If an alcohol test is required pursuant to this section and is not administered within two (2) hours following the accident, the supervisor for the employee shall prepare a written report explaining why the test was not promptly administered and shall forward that report to the designated risk management official for the city. If an alcohol test is required pursuant to this section and is not administered within eight (8) hours following an accident, the city shall discontinue efforts to administer an alcohol test and the supervisor for that employee shall prepare a written report explaining why the alcohol test was not conducted. The written report shall be sent to the designated risk management official for the city.
If a drug test is required pursuant to this section and is not administered within thirty-two (32) hours following an accident, the city shall discontinue efforts to administer a drug test and the supervisor for that employee shall prepare a written report explaining why the drug test was not conducted. The written report shall be sent to the designated risk management official for the city.
3.
Reasonable suspicion testing. Reasonable suspicion testing is designed to identify alcohol or drug affected employees who may pose a danger to themselves or to others in their job performance.
The decision to test an employee for alcohol or drugs pursuant to this section must be based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion of alcohol or drug use by the employee on the basis of specific contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators. The observations which underlie the decision to test on the basis of reasonable suspicion for alcohol must be made during, just before, or just after the performance of covered functions by the employee. Only supervisors who have received at least sixty (60) minutes of training in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse may make a determination that reasonable suspicion of alcohol use exists. One (1) supervisor who has received the required training may make the decision to test an employee for alcohol under this provision. At least two (2) of the employee's supervisors, one (1) of whom is trained in detection of the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the decision to test an employee for drugs. The concurrence between two (2) supervisors may be by telephone.
If a reasonable suspicion test is not administered within two (2) hours following the determination that testing is appropriate, the supervisor shall prepare a written report explaining why the test was not promptly administered and forward the report to the designated risk management official for the city. If the test is not performed within eight hours of the determination, then the city will discontinue efforts to administer a test and the supervisor shall prepare a written report explaining why the test was not administered and forward the report to a designated risk management official for the city.
The city will not permit a covered employee to report for duty or to remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol or drug misuse.
4.
Return to duty testing. Before an employee may return to duty to perform covered functions after engaging in prohibited conduct, the city shall require the employee to successfully complete a substance abuse evaluation and any recommended course of treatment. Employees who have violated the policy with respect to the use of alcohol must also take a return to duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than two one-hundredths (0.02) before the employee may resume his or her duties. Employees who have violated the policy with respect to the use of drugs must also take a return to duty drug test with a confirmed negative result and must also have been recommended for a return to duty by the medical review officer.
5.
Follow-up testing. Following the return to duty of an employee who has violated the terms of this policy, the employee will be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol or drug testing as directed by a substance abuse professional (SAP) for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return to duty. The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced alcohol or drug follow-up test during the first twelve (12) months following his or her return to duty in addition to any other testing conducted pursuant to the provisions of this policy. The SAP may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the initial six (6) tests have been completed if the SAP makes the determination that continued testing is not warranted. Follow-up testing shall be conducted just before, during or immediately following the performance of a covered function.
6.
Random testing. All employees who work in a position which is covered by this policy shall be subject to unannounced drug testing based on a random selection process. To insure that the selections are random, employees shall be placed in a common pool via their Social Security numbers and the selections shall be computer generated. Employees shall be tested at a rate of fifty (50) percent every twelve (12) months. Test dates shall also be randomly selected and there shall be a minimum of four (4) test dates per year or one (1) per quarter. A person may be selected for drug testing more than once or not at all during the annual period.

B.
Scope of this policy. This policy applies to every city employee who operates a commercial motor vehicle ("CMV") and who is required to have a commercial driver's license ("CDL"). Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant or employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or any procedure under the terms of this policy or by signing any consent form or other document required by the testing laboratory shall be ground for refusal to hire or disciplinary actions including termination of employment at the sole discretion of the city. A commercial motor vehicle for purposes of this policy is: a tractor trailer or similar vehicle, with a gross combination weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more (inclusive of a towed unit with a gross vehicle weight rating of at least ten thousand (10,000) pounds); a single vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more; a vehicle that is designed to transport sixteen (16) or more persons, including the driver, or a vehicle that transports hazardous materials (as defined in 49 CFR part 172.1, et al).

C.
General statement of policy. Concerning the use of alcohol, no employee who performs safety-sensitive functions shall operate a CMV if the employee: has a blood alcohol concentrations of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater; is presently using alcohol; or, has used alcohol within four (4) hours of coming onto duty.
Concerning the use of drugs, an employee shall not report for duty or remain on duty if the employee uses or has in their possession any illegal drug. No employee may perform a safety-sensitive job function while unlawfully using or following a positive drug test result.
Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, unlawful use, or unlawful possession of hallucinogenic drugs, narcotics, or other controlled substances (or paraphernalia related to the use of such substances) is prohibited. Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, use or possession of alcohol is prohibited during working hours or at any time on city property.
An employee either reporting to work visibly impaired or observed to be visibly impaired while on duty will be deemed unable to perform required duties and will not be permitted to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's impaired status. If, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, the employee is impaired, the employee may be sent home or to a medical facility by a safe means of transportation (after any reasonable cause drug or alcohol testing required by this policy). The employee may be accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. Under no circumstances will an apparently impaired employee be allowed to drive a car or other vehicle. If a drug or alcohol test cannot be administered under this policy, the apparently impaired driver shall nonetheless remain ineligible to perform any driving duties for at least twenty-four (24) hours.
If an employee is undergoing any medical treatment that involves the ingestion of any medications that have the potential to impair work performance, he or she must advise their supervisor of treatment and present appropriate medical documentation. A decision will then be made by the supervisor whether the employee should be able to perform his or her job safely and properly. Employees must keep all prescribed medications in its original container, which identifies the drug, date of prescription, and prescribing doctor.
D.
Required testing.
1.
Pre-employment and pretransfer testing. The city will test each driver for alcohol and for illegal drugs before the first time a driver performs a safety-sensitive function. All applicants for employment in positions that are covered by this policy must submit to a drug test as a prequalification condition of employment. All current employees whom the city intends to transfer into a position that is covered by this policy must submit to a drug test as a pre-qualification condition of transfer.
If a driver has participated in a department of transportation-qualified drug testing program within the previous thirty (30) days and the driver passed a drug test administered within the six (6) months prior to the driver's application date, or the driver was subject to random testing for the twelve (12) months prior to the driver's application date, then that driver may be exempt from pre-employment or pretransfer testing. If a pre-employment or pre-transfer test is not performed pursuant to the provision, then the procedures set forth in 49 CFR section 382.301(d) will be followed before the performance of any safety-sensitive job duties.

Employee found to have an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater, but less than four one-hundredths (0.04) will not be allowed to perform safety-sensitive functions for twenty-four (24) hours following the test.
2.
Postaccident testing. For each accident involving a commercial motor vehicle, the city will test each surviving driver if the employee was performing a safety-sensitive function that could have contributed to the cause of the accident.
All alcohol tests will be administered, if possible, within two (2) hours, but not more than eight (8) hours following the accident. All drug tests will be administered within thirty-two (32) hours following the accident. The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol or a urine test for the use of drugs, if conducted by local or state officials pursuant to an accident investigation, will be considered a test for the purposes of this policy.
Whenever an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours after the accident, the employee's supervisor must prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. Whenever a test is not administered within the additional time limits set forth above, the employee's supervisor must prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. The original of any such statement shall be forwarded to the program manager (See attachment F).
Any driver subject to postaccident testing must remain readily available for testing, otherwise, the driver will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. A driver who is unable to submit to testing at the time of the accident because of serious injuries received in the accident shall provide to the city the necessary authorization for the city to obtain hospital reports or other documents that would indicate the presence of any controlled substances or alcohol in the driver's system. Refusal to provide such authorization may be treated by the city as a refusal to submit to testing under this policy. An employee may be considered readily available for testing if: the employee notifies the city of his or her whereabouts; the employee was required to leave the scene to seek medical attention for himself, herself, or others; or, the employee left the scene to obtain assistance in responding to the accident.
3.
Random testing. The city will administer random alcohol test to twenty-five (25) percent of the average number of drivers positions in each individual category of driver positions annually unless the federal highway administrator changes the percentage of random test required. The city shall conduct random drug testing of fifty (50) percent of the average number of driver positions in each individual category of driver positions annually.
Each driver will have any equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. Selections will be made randomly. The dates of testing will be unannounced and will be reasonably spread throughout the calendar year. If a driver is notified of selection for random testing, the driver must proceed to the test site immediately. A driver will only be tested for alcohol while the driver is performing a safety-sensitive function, just before performing a safety-sensitive function, or just after performing a safety-sensitive function.
4.
Reasonable suspicion testing. If the city has a reasonable suspicion that a driver is under the influence of prohibited drugs or alcohol, the city, will require the driver to submit to a drug or alcohol test. Reasonable suspicion will be based on the observations of the actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct of an on-duty driver that indicate the possible use of a prohibited drug or alcohol. The actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct of the driver must be witnessed by at least one (1) city official or supervisor who has received department of transportation approved training, in the detection of probable drug or alcohol use. Third-party reports that an employee is impaired in his or her driving duties due to the use of prohibited drugs or alcohol shall not constitute reasonable cause, but may be cause for the observation of the employee by the supervisor.
Whenever an employee is required to be tested under this provision, the city shall provide transportation to the testing site for the employee.
A driver will only be required to undergo reasonable suspicion alcohol testing just before, during, or just after the performance of a safety-sensitive function. Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing will be performed if possible within two (2) hours following the reasonable suspicion observation, but not more than eight (8) hours following the observation. If an alcohol test cannot be performed within two (2) hours following a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not administered promptly. If a written statement is made for failure to procure the required test in a prompt manner, the original must be sent to a designated official in the city personnel department.
Once the city, through an official or supervisor, observes indications of alcohol use, the city will not allow the driver to perform any safety-sensitive functions until an alcohol test is administered and the driver's blood alcohol concentration is less than two one-hundredths (0.02), or twenty-four (24) hours have elapsed.
A written record shall be made of the observations leading to a reasonable suspicion alcohol or controlled substance test and signed by the supervisor or official who made the specific observations within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior or manifestations or before the results of the controlled substance test are released, whichever is earlier. In addition to the written record set forth above, the supervisor or official shall utilize the observation checklist which is attached. The originals of both the written record and the observation checklist shall be forwarded to the designated official in the city personnel department.
5.
Testing following a return to duty. Employees who are charged with a criminal offense involving drugs or alcohol, or who voluntarily seek treatment for substance addiction prior to being found in violation of this policy, or who are not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy may not resume driving duties without first:
a.
Undergoing an initial evaluation by a substance abuse professional;
b.
Completing all recommended treatment;
c.
Undergoing a follow-up evaluation, with a substance abuse professional;
d.
Providing written documentation of the successful completion of all recommended treatment to the designated treatment to the program manager; and
e.
Taking a return-to-duty drug or alcohol test with a verified negative result.
A driver who has completed drug or alcohol rehabilitation treatment under this policy shall, upon the resumption of driving duties, be subject to unannounced testing. Such testing shall be conducted over a period of twelve (12) to sixty (60) months and shall include at least six (6) unannounced tests during the first twelve (12) months of his or her return to duty. The type, frequency, and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of such testing shall be at the direction of the substance abuse professional who has evaluated the employee. The substance abuse professional may terminate the testing at any point following the first six (6) tests under this provision. Each unannounced alcohol test shall be administered either immediately before, during or after the driver has performed driving duties.
E.
Notification of results. For pre-employment drug tests, the city will inform the driver of the result only if the driver requests the results within sixty (60) calendar days of being notified of the disposition of the employment application.
For random, reasonable suspicion and postaccident test for drugs or alcohol, the medical review officer shall make all reasonable efforts to contact the driver prior to making a determination to verify a test result as positive to determine whether the driver wishes to discuss the test result with the medical review officer. The medical review officer shall notify each employee who has confirmed positive test result that the employee has seventy-two (72) hours to request a test of the split specimen.
If, after making all reasonable efforts, the MRO is unable to contact an employee, then the MRO must contact a designated city official from the personnel department, who then shall direct the employee to speak with the medical review officer as soon as possible. If the employee cannot be contacted after reasonable efforts have been made to do so, then the employee may be placed on temporary medically unqualified status or medical leave.
The current medical review officer is Dr. Frank Stagg, who may [be] contacted at 2510 Highway 127, Kathleen, Georgia, 31047 or by telephone at (478) 987-1778.
F.
Employee assistance program. Each employee driver who has violated any aspect of this policy shall be advised of the resources to the driver in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and the use of controlled substances, including the names, addresses and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs. Furthermore, each driver employee who engages in any conduct prohibited by this policy shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional, through Houston Medical Center, who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs n resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and controlled substances use.
No aspect of this policy shall require the city to provide an employee assistance program (EAP) for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy and for supervisory personnel. The city may provide an EAP for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy; however, the availability of, and eligibility for, benefits under such EAP shall be governed by the terms of that program. Participation in such a program if it is made available by the city shall not excuse an employee from this policy's testing provisions or requirements for removal from duty.
All employees who return to duty following a period of treatment for substance addiction shall be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol and drug tests as explained in subsection D-5 of this section.
G.
Consequences of violating this policy. Violation of the provisions of this policy concerning drug and alcohol abuse may lead to severe disciplinary action, including discharge for the first offense, at the sole discretion of the city. Refusal to submit to testing in any manner prescribed by this policy shall result in termination of employment.
For all violations of this policy, the city shall take the following action:
1.
Removal from safety-sensitive function. The city will not permit any driver to perform safety-sensitive functions, including driving a commercial motor vehicle, if the city has determined that the driver has violated this policy.
2.
Required evaluation, treatment and testing. The city will not allow any driver who has violated this policy to perform a safety-sensitive function unless the driver has met the referral, evaluation, treatment and testing requirements of this policy.
H.

  ATTACHMENT B
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED FOR EMPLOYEES SUSPECTED TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THE ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE POLICY
If in the opinion of the department director or his/her designee, a reasonable suspicion (a reasonable suspicion must be based on objective indications of alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse; more obvious indications of alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse include repeated unauthorized absences, repeated illnesses, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, lethargic behavior, behavior inappropriate or inconsistent with circumstances, or an employees arrest for DUI, public drunk, or violation of the Georgia Controlled Substance Act) exists that the employee is reporting to work, or is working, while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, or while impaired from the use of same, the following procedures shall be followed:
1.
A supervisor shall determine if an employee "appears" to be under the influence of alcohol, drugs, including controlled substances and prescriptions, or both.
2.
The supervisor shall arrange, for at least one other supervisor to observe the conduct of the employee. The observing supervisor shall make a written report (See attachment D-1) of the observations, which report shall include a description of the conduct of the employee upon which such reasonable suspicion is based.
In the case of an arrest, a copy of the police reports will be obtained.
3.
A supervisor shall personally escort the employee to the supervisor's office.
4.
The supervisor shall have a witness present during the questioning of the employee.
5.
The employee shall be asked to explain why it appears that he/she is under the influence of or impaired by the use of alcohol or controlled substances. The supervisor shall ask the questions in sequence as in "Questions for Suspected Alcohol or Substance Users", (attachment B-2).
6.
If the employee agrees, the supervisor shall have the employee take the "Basic On-Site Coordination Examination", (attachment B-3), in the presence of the witness.
7.
The supervisor shall complete the "Opinion Based on Observations" checklist, (attachment B-4).
8.
If the supervisor concludes that the employee does not appear to be under the influence of alcohol, drugs, including controlled substances and prescription drugs, or both, and he is able to perform his work duties, then he will have the employee return to his work site.
9.
If the supervisor concludes that the employee is unfit for work due to the influence of alcohol, drugs, including controlled substances and prescriptions, or both, then the department head or his designee will request the employee to go to a city designated physician for drug screening, or the police department for a Breathalyser, with the employee signing a consent form (alcohol and controlled substance policy attachment B-5) agreeing to testing, and being escorted to the medical facility or police department by a supervisor.
10.
The department head or his designee will contact the department of personnel who will schedule this test with the medical facility or police department. This test will be conducted at the expense of the city.
11.
If the chemical analysis results of such tests indicate the presence of alcohol or any controlled substance in the system of the employee in any degree, it will be assumed that the employee is in violation of this policy. This assumption of policy violation will result in:
a.
Discipline the employee following the procedural guidelines as set forth in the city personnel policy manual.
b.
Refer the employee to the employee assistance program, when applicable, and they will determine if there is a significant chance that the employee can be rehabilitated and the employee has not committed an act or omission which presented an immediate danger to the public or fellow workers. This referral would be the employee's "last chance". After successful completion of an alcohol and/or controlled substance rehabilitation program, the employee may return to work subject to random alcohol and controlled substance screening tests for a period of twelve (12) months. If at any time during this "last chance" testing period, a screening test indicates the presence of alcohol or any controlled substance in the employee's system, the employee shall be immediately terminated.
c.
In the event of an employee's arrest, the EAP is not available.
d.
Violation of regulations A and B of this policy (Page 2) will ordinarily result in termination consistent with the procedural guidelines set forth in the city personnel policy manual.
12.
The employee may through his/her own effort attempt to rebut the assumption of policy violation. For example, in the case of a urine sample used to detect violation of controlled substances, the employee may request an additional test of the remaining portion of his/her sample. However, additional testing will be at the expense of the employee. If such tests produce negative results, the assumption of policy violation may be considered rebutted depending upon such factors as the timing of the tests and other circumstances surrounding the indication of policy violation, and the employee may be reimbursed the cost of the second test.
13.
A refusal of testing will be treated as insubordination and will be grounds for discipline.
14.
Under no circumstances shall the employee suspected of being under the influence of alcohol, drugs, including controlled substances and prescriptions, or both, be permitted to leave the worksite by himself.
Necessary arrangements should be made to have the employee taken home. If the employee refuses any assistance, be certain that the witness can verify such refusal. However, if an employee cannot control his actions, under no circumstances should he be allowed to leave without assistance. The supervisor must call the Perry Police Department to warn them of the employee's condition and refusal of assistance before the employee is allowed to leave the work site. Law enforcement officials should be told the employee's name and make of car.
15.
The supervisor and witness shall be present throughout all proceedings, appropriate notes should be taken for future reference and supporting documentation.
16.
The supervisor and witness shall be aware at all times of the employee's "right to privacy" and involve only those people who have a "need to know" in the situation, the confidentiality of the case will be protected.
