Sec. 25-183. - High strength wastewater surcharge.
(a)
Establishment.
(1)
All users discharging high strength wastewater into the sewer system shall be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. "High strength wastewater" is defined as wastewater which contains pollutant concentrations in excess of those provided in section 25-179(a).
(2)
The parameters shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 25-177. The amount of the surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the sewer system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess BOD, COD, TSS, ammonia, and FOG. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, including depreciation and other incidental expenses.
(3)
The current domestic limits and rates shall be on file and available at the office of the city clerk.
(b)
Formula. When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown in this section exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a) of section 25-179, the excess concentrations shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula plus the cost of plant upset including extra chemicals, labor, etc.
P x D x 8.34 x C = $/month
Where:
"P" is equal to the concentration in mg/l of the parameter being evaluated (BOD, TSS, ammonia, or FOG), which is in excess of the amounts shown in subsection (a) of section 25-179.
"D" is equal to the user's monthly water consumption in millions of gallons as determined from the user's monthly water meter or sewage flow meter readings. "8.34" is a conversion factor.
"C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb.) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the superintendent based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary.
(c)
Quantitative measurement of surchargable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD, COD, TSS, ammonia) shall be conducted as follows:
(1)
The city shall sample and test the user as provided in section 25-177 once per year, except that the duration of the sampling to determine surcharge shall be for a period of not less than five (5) calendar days.
(2)
The city need not provide any prior notice to the industry with regard to the sampling period.
(3)
The city may sample the user as often as desired at the city's expense if, in the opinion of the city, representative samples have not been previously obtained.
(4)
If, in the opinion of the user, the samples taken by the city are not representative of the user's typical wastewater, then the user may request up to two (2) additional re-samplings. The user will be assessed a fee by the city which will be based on the actual costs to the city associated with re-sampling. The city may, but is not required to, provide the user with prior notice of the entry.
(5)
The user shall employ a certified, third-party testing agency to sample and test once per calendar year. Results from the third-party testing must be provided to the city.
(d)
Measurement of flow used in computing wastewater service charges and surcharges. The volumes of flow used in computing wastewater surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the city water department or from discharge metering as provided in section 25-179 subsections (f) and (g).
(e)
Perceived harm. Where a discharge causes harm or is perceived to cause harm to the treatment works in violation of section 25-179, the superintendent may void any rights to surcharge for high strength wastes and proceed with any enforcement.
