VIII. - Special Overlay Districts

8.1 - Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District.
1.
Intent: In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Taliaferro County, Georgia, and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. The objectives of this section are to:
a.
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
b.
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
c.
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
2.
Establishment of District: A Groundwater Recharge Area District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Taliaferro County, Georgia, that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 1989 edition.
3.
Pollution Susceptibility: All recharge areas within Taliaferro County have a medium pollution susceptibility, as indicated by the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
4.

All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.
(ii)
Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of this section shall be fined not more than $500 for each offense. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.

8.2 - Wetland Protection District.
1.
Intent: The wetlands within Taliaferro County, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is therefore necessary for Taliaferro County, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. The purpose of this district is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this district is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.
2.
Wetland Protection District:
a.
Wetland Protection District: This section shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of Taliaferro County, Georgia. A Generalized Wetlands Map, adopted as part of this Code, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The Generalized Wetland Map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Code. The Generalized Wetland Map shall be on file in the office of the Clerk of Taliaferro County.
b.
Wetland Protection District Boundaries: The Generalized Wetland Map is a general reference document, and the wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the Generalized Wetland Map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The Generalized Wetland Map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of Taliaferro County, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Code does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
3.
Local Development Permits:
a.
Local Development Permit Requirements: No regulated activity will be allowed within the Wetland Protection District without written permission from Taliaferro County in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this Code and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in Section 7.2.3b shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 200 feet of the Wetland Protection District boundary, as determined by Taliaferro County or authorized designee using the Generalized Wetland Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission.
b.
Permitted and Prohibited Uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein:

(iii)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

(1)
Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to Taliaferro County and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
(2)
Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
(3)
Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of Section 7.2.3d.
(4)
Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.

(I)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
(II)
Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.
c.
