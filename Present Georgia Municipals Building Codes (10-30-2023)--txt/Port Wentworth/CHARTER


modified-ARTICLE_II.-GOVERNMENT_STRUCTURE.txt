(4)
Upon service of a complaint, a respondent may, but is not required to, file a written answer or response to the allegations alleged in a complaint. If a respondent elects to file a written answer or response, such answer or response shall be filed within ten business days after the respondent is served.
(5)
To discourage the filing of ethics complaints solely for political purposes during an election year cycle, a complaint under this article made against or by a person seeking election or re-election as a candidate for office which is filed between the qualifying date for municipal office and the date of certification of the election results may, after consulting with the city attorney, be held by the city clerk and not processed until after the election results for that election cycle have been certified. If the city clerk elects to hold any complaint during this period, he or she shall notify the mayor and city council in writing that a complaint has been filed and that, after consulting with the city attorney, the city clerk is invoking this section to hold, not process, and not serve the complaint until the official election results have been certified for that election year cycle. If the city clerk determines, after consulting with the city attorney, that a complaint should not be held, the city clerk will process the complaint as required in this article.
(e)
Municipal court jurisdiction of complaints.
(1)
The Municipal Court of the City of Port Wentworth shall hear and issue final decisions on all proper complaints filed under this section. The municipal court may establish such rules, processes, and procedures as it deems necessary to investigate, conduct hearings, and issue a final decision on complaints. The municipal court shall have subpoena authority to compel testimony, may request assistance of city staff, or may engage outside investigators as may be appropriate, at city expense, to aid the court in the investigation and adjudication of a complaint under this section.
(2)
If a municipal court judge assigned to hear a complaint under this article determines that he or she has an actual or potential conflict of interest or determines for other reasons that he or she should recuse himself or herself from hearing the complaint, the assigned municipal court judge shall enter an order of recusal and reassign the matter to another judge or judge pro tem who will hear the complaint and issue a final decision.
(3)
Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, the municipal court judge shall initially review the complaint to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded, or fails to state facts sufficient on its face to invoke the jurisdiction of the municipal court under this section.
(4)
If the municipal court determines upon initial review that a complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded, or fails to state facts sufficient on its face to invoke the jurisdiction of the municipal court, the court shall dismiss the complaint by written order. A dismissal upon initial review shall be considered a final decision for appeal purposes and shall not deprive a complainant of his or her right to take action or seek other remedies as such complainant might otherwise have under this section, at law or in equity.
(5)
If the municipal court judge does not dismiss a complaint upon initial review, the municipal court shall conduct a hearing in accordance with any process and procedure the court may establish by order or otherwise. Such hearings shall be held by the court within 60 calendar days after a proper complaint is filed but in no event shall a hearing be held within ten business days of a respondent being served under this section.
(6)
A complainant shall have the burden of proof to prove the allegations asserted in his or her complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. The respondent shall also have the right, but no obligation, to present evidence in his or her defense or in mitigation. Further, the parties may be heard either personally or through counsel.
(7)
At any hearing, the parties may examine and cross-examine witnesses and shall have subpoena authority to compel the production of witnesses, documents, or other evidence from any party or third party upon prior submission to and subject to approval of all subpoenas by the municipal court judge. This provision shall not preclude a party from filing a motion to quash any subpoenas the municipal court may approve.
(8)
The municipal court may take sworn testimony and may receive documentary or other evidence in accordance with the rules of evidence or procedure adopted pursuant to this section.
(9)
The municipal court shall:
(A)
Within 30 days after the conclusion of a hearing, in written findings of fact and conclusions based thereon, issue a final decision concerning the propriety of the conduct of the official or employee named in a complaint; and
(B)
The court's final decision shall recommend to the mayor and city council either that:
(i)
All or portions of the complaint be dismissed for any reason and analysis set forth in the final decision; or
(ii)
The court finds that one or more enumerated violations of this section occurred and that the final decision is referred to the mayor and city council for consideration, deliberation, and vote upon penalty, if any. The municipal court is not required to, but may, recommend a penalty to city council for its consideration. The municipal court judge's final decision shall be served upon all parties, the city clerk, and the city attorney. The city clerk, upon receipt of a final decision, shall forward the final decision to the mayor and city council for consideration, deliberation, and voting action at public meeting.
(10)
The intent of this section is to provide the municipal court the maximum flexibility to establish due process and procedure to conduct any investigation and hearing required and shall not be construed to limit the municipal court's authority in any way to reach a just adjudication of any complaint filed under this section. It is also the intent of this article that, except as to the 30 day time to appeal to the superior court specified in subsection (g) of this section, the time deadlines set forth in this section shall be guidelines only and shall not be construed to be jurisdictional in any manner so as to invalidate by lapse of time a valid complaint, answer, or response or to in any way affect the jurisdiction of the municipal court itself or the mayor and city council to act upon any complaint or final decision of the municipal court.
(f)
Penalties.
(1)
Upon receipt of a final decision by the municipal court, the mayor and city council may place the final decision upon the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city council for discussion, consideration, deliberation, and vote for penalties the mayor and city council may levy upon the party, if any;
(2)
Any person found by municipal court final decision to have violated any provision of this section shall be subject, after majority vote of the mayor and city council, to:
(A)
Public reprimand or censure by the mayor and city council;
(B)
Issuance of a formal request for resignation by the mayor and council; or
(C)
No penalty.
Nothing in this section shall preclude an official from being removed under the removal provisions set forth in Article V of this charter.
(3)
Contracts voidable and rescindable. Any violation of this article which occurs with the knowledge, express or implied, of another party to a contract, sale, or business relationship with the city shall render said contract, sale or business relationship with the city voidable as to that party, at the option of the city council.
(g)
Right to appeal.
(1)
A complainant or respondent adversely affected by a final decision or resulting penalty action under this section may seek judicial review of such final decision or resulting city council penalty action as provided herein.
(2)
A petition seeking judicial review of a final decision may be commenced by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the Superior Court of Chatham County within 30 days after a final decision is rendered. The 30 day right to appeal shall be a subject matter jurisdiction limitation time to appeal, and failure of any affected party to file an application for writ of certiorari within that time period shall deprive the superior court of jurisdiction to hear any appeal.
(3)
The filing of an appeal and application for judicial review shall act as a supersedeas writ and stay any penalty or action imposed by the city council until further order of the Superior Court of Chatham County.
