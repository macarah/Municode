Sec. 5-175. - General provisions.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of an underground storage system containing pollutants to permit or maintain leaks in such underground storage systems.
(b)
Whenever a leak from an underground storage system occurs, the operator shall report such a leak to the city building inspector within one (1) working day of detection. Within forty-eight (48) hours, all leaks shall be stopped or the underground storage system shall be pumped clean of pollutant.
(c)
No underground storage system which has leased or has otherwise failed shall be placed into service for the purpose of reusing the underground storage system without:
(1)
Preventing the leak from migrating to another area or preventing the leak from spreading to cover a larger area.
(2)
Performing or having the repairs or replacement performed in a manner which complies with the applicable subsections 5-179(A) through (D).
(3)
Testing or having the underground storage tank and/or integral piping system tested in accordance with the provisions in subsection 5-179(E).
(d)
When a leak occurs, the owner or operator shall remove the free-floating pollutant from the groundwater, remove any combustible or harmful vapors emitted from the pollutant, and ensure that the level of dissolved hydrocarbons in the water be no greater than declared acceptable for public health by the Georgia Department of Environmental Protection.
(e)
Investigation of a leak shall commence within three (3) working days from the date of detection by the operator. Investigation shall be conducted by a qualified soil/groundwater investigation and pollutant analysis removal firm. In the investigation process, the owner or operator, through appropriate testing, shall determine the type of pollutant leaked, the limits of the leak accumulation and the quantity of leaked pollutant.
(f)
The owner or operator shall submit to the city building inspector, within twenty-one (21) calendar days from the date of detection, a pollutant removal and monitoring plan. This plan shall be developed by a qualified soil/groundwater investigation and pollutant analysis removal firm. Removal shall commence within twenty-five (25) calendar days from the date of detection by the owner or operator, unless extenuating circumstances dictate otherwise. The city building inspector shall decide if the extenuating circumstances warrant an extension of time. Where an extension of time is warranted, the city building inspector and the owner or operator shall agree on a time extension for the date of commencement of the removal operations.
(g)
Whenever "owner" or "operator" is used conjunctively with the other and the parties have by agreement identified which party has the primary responsibility for compliance with this article and have filed, with the city building inspector, a written statement executed by both evidencing that agreement, the city shall deem the party assuming the primary responsibility as the party subject to compliance with this article. The party assuming the primary responsibility can also sign the appropriate space furnished by the underground tank registration form specified in section 5-176. The only exemptions to this provision shall be where:
(1)
The other party has separately violated this article;
(2)
The property has been abandoned by the operator when the violation occurs, in which event the owner shall be deemed responsible; or
(3)
Both parties have caused the violation.
(Ord. No. 87-9, § 6, 6-11-87)
Sec. 5-176. - Pollutant, tank and piping systems registration.
On a form furnished by the city building inspector, each operator of an underground storage system shall file with the city building inspector within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the adoption of this article, the size of tank, type of tank and piping system, type of leak detection system(s), age of tank, general location of each tank and integral piping system, and type of pollutant stored.
(Ord. No. 87-9, § 7, 6-11-87)
Sec. 5-177. - Inventory control.
(a)
A weekly inventory shall be made for each underground tank to determine possible leakage of the underground tank or integral piping system. Inventory shall be based on the actual daily measurement, recording of pollutant and water levels in the tank and the daily recording of actual withdrawals or additions. Daily measurements shall be made by gauge or gauge stick or by readout from an automated gauging system. The inventory records shall include the computation of the daily gains or losses. When an abnormal loss or gain is found, the operator shall follow procedures in section 5-175 and subsection 5-179(E). The mere recording of pump meter readings and pollutant delivery receipts shall not constitute adequate records.
(b)
Daily measurements need not be made on those days that an underground storage system is not in operation. However, when the system is not in operation, an inventory shall be made on such system at least every fifteen (15) calendar days.
(c)
Each operator shall participate in a program of regularly scheduled inspection and inventory verification conducted by the city building inspector annually. Inventory records shall be retained by the operator for a period of two (2) years. The operator shall submit annually to the city building inspector a certified statement that inventory records have been maintained, reconciled and preserved as required by this article. Upon the request of the state fire marshal, such records shall be made available to him within five (5) working days.

Out-of-service storage systems:
(1)
The owner or operator of an out-of-service underground storage system shall have recorded an inventory at least once every fifteen (15) calendar days and shall examine and record results of the leak detection and monitoring system monthly unless the underground storage system contains no pollutant. An out-of-service storage system which contains no pollutant shall be secured against tampering and unauthorized filling and shall be inspected monthly for sign of damage to the security system. The underground storage system may be filled with water for ballasting.
(2)
An underground storage system may be kept out of service for more than one (1) year and not deemed abandoned if approved by the city building inspector.
(b)
Abandoned storage systems:
(1)
The owner or operator of an underground storage system that is to be abandoned or is declared abandoned under the provisions of this article must, within forty-eight (48) hours of abandonment, pump the system clean of pollutants. Within ninety (90) days of abandonment, the owner or operator shall remove the underground storage system in a safe manner, except that, in lieu of removal, the underground storage tanks may be filled with sand, concrete or other inert material in accordance with requirements in API Bulletin 1604, 1981, Chapter 2.
(2)
The owner or operator of an abandoned underground tank shall not dispose of such tank except in accordance with the specifications of API 1604, Chapters 3 and 6, and the following requirements: If the tank is disposed of as junk, it must be rendered vapor-free and dismantled or perforated in a safe manner so as to render it unfit for further use.
