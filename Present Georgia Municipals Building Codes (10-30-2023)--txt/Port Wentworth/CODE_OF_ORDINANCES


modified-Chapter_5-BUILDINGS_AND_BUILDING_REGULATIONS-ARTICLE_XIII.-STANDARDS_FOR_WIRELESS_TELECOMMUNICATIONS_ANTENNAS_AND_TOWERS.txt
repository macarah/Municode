(d)
Regulatory compliance. Telecommunications facilities owners shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. Such evidence of compliance shall be submitted to the city administrator every three (3) years. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner(s) of the communication towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such tower or antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency.
(e)
Security. Telecommunications facilities, except for alternative tower structures, shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with anti-climbing device.
(f)
Advertising. Except for the manufacturer's name plate and owner identification, advertising on telecommunications facilities shall be prohibited.
(g)
Access. Access for maintenance vehicles shall be via collector or greater classified right-of-way or other access as approved by the Port Wentworth Planning Commission.
(h)
Mixed use development. Telecommunication towers may be located on sites containing another principal use on the same site, subject to the group development provisions of section 6-5 of the city's zoning regulations.
(i)
Accessory structures. Accessory structures shall only be used to house equipment and other supplies in support of the tower site. Such structures shall not be used for offices. Any equipment not used in direct support of a tower site shall not be stored on the site.
(j)
Historic sites. Telecommunications facilities shall not be attached to or mounted to historically significant buildings or structures as identified by the city.
(Ord. No. 97-8, § IV, 4-10-97)
Sec. 5-238. - Development standards.
(a)
Setbacks and separations. Telecommunications facilities shall comply with the following standards:
(1)
All structures and uses accessory to telecommunications towers shall comply with the setbacks as required by the zoning district in which the tower is to be located.
(2)
The height limitations applicable to building in the zoning districts in which telecommunications facility or alternative tower structure is located shall not apply to such facilities and structures; provided, however, in commercial and industrial zoning districts, monopoles shall not exceed a height of two hundred fifty (250) feet.
(3)
All communication towers, whether monopole, guy tower, or lattice tower, shall be situated on the property in such a manner that the tower can not fall outside the tower site with the exception of Industrial-Heavy (I-2). Also the tower site cannot be subdivided as long as the tower remains on the property.
(b)
Landscaping, buffers and screening. Telecommunications tower sites shall be landscaped with a buffer or plant materials such that the view of the base of the tower is screened from public right-of-ways, public property and residential property. (Such telecommunications facilities shall also comply with the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance.)
(c)

The design of buildings and related structures at tower sites shall use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that creates a level of compatibility with the natural environment and existing land use pattern.
(3)
Antennas installed on an alternative tower structures and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a neutral color that is similar to, or complements the color of the alternative tower structure.
(Ord. No. 97-8, § V, 4-10-97)
Sec. 5-239. - Shared use/collocation
New tower sites shall not be established if there is an existing technically and financially feasible suitable space available for shared use/collection on an existing tower.
(a)
The applicant for a permit to develop a telecommunications facility must demonstrate to the planning commission that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of any of the following:
(1)
No existing telecommunications facilities or alternative tower structures are located within the geographic area necessary to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
(2)
Existing telecommunications facilities or alternative tower structures have insufficient height and can not be modified in such a manner that would be financially feasible to accommodate the applicant's engineering requirements.
(3)
Existing telecommunications facilities or alternative tower structures do not have sufficient structural integrity or strength and can not be modified in such a manner that would be financially feasible in order to support the proposed antenna and related equipment.
(4)
The proposed antennas would cause interference with the antennas on the existing tower or alternative tower structure, or the antenna on the existing tower or alternative tower structure would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(5)
The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or alternative tower structure or to adopt an existing tower or alternative tower structure for sharing are unreasonable.
(6)
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limitations that render existing telecommunications facilities unsuitable.
(b)
Upon approval to locate, permit applicants for telecommunications towers and antennas shall demonstrate their intent to permit the shared use of such facilities with other communications apparatus which do not interfere with the primary purpose of the tower or antenna.
(Ord. No. 97-8, § VI, 4-10-97)
