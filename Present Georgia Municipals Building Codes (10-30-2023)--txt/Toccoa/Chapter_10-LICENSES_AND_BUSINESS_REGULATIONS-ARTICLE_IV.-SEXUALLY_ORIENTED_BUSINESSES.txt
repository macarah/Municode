Editor's note— Ord. No. 20006-19, § 1, adopted Nov. 13, 2006, repealed former Art. IV, §§ 10-171—10-198, in its entirety and enacted new provsions as herein set out. Former Art. IV pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 94-013, § I, adopted June 13, 1994.

DIVISION 1. - PURPOSE AND FINDINGS

Sec. 10-171. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Toccoa, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the associated adverse secondary effects with the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
(Ord. No. 2006-19, § 1, 11-13-06)
Sec. 10-172. - Findings.
Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in a public hearing and in reports made available to the city commission, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; and also on findings form the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the City Commission finds:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses cause ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities, including, but not limited to, prostitution and illicit drug trafficking and consumption, both within such businesses and in the areas immediately nearby, which are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
(2)
Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this article as adult theatres and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
(3)
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
(4)
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of sexually oriented businesses.
(5)
Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS) and genital herpes.
(6)
Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States.
(7)
The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States, as well as the state, reported annually has risen.
(8)
In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual conduct, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
(9)
According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts from direct or indirect physical contact.
(10)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
(11)
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films.
(12)
The findings noted in subsections (b)(1)—(11) and (13)—(15) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns.
(13)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(14)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is operated in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(15)
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters.
(16)
Requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
(17)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
(18)
In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designated to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct.
(19)
The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article.
(20)
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(21)
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the City of Toccoa will be promoted by the enactment of this article.
