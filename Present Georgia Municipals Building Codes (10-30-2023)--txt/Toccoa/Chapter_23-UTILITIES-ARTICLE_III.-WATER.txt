(2)
All water main extensions shall meet the rules, regulations and specifications of the city and the state.
(3)
All main extensions shall be six-inch diameter water pipe unless larger or smaller size is recommended by the water director, fire chief and city manager and approved by the city commission.
(4)
All main extensions shall be made at the expense of the developer. Should larger main size, above six inches in diameter, be required by the city for its purposes, the city may agree to pay a pro rata share of the cost.
(5)
Upon filing a request for water service, the developer shall submit complete plans. The area to be served shall be spelled out including the number of potential customers in the development, and, if any, those on the proposed route.
(6)
Requests for meter sets, other than developments shall be subject to the following:

(Code 1985, § 6-3-15; Ord. No. 87-035, § 6-3-15, 9-28-87)
Sec. 23-63. - Protection of water supply—Generally.
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations of this article. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow device required by this article is not installed, tested and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow preventive device has been removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions are corrected. If, in the judgement of the waterworks director, an approved check valve or backflow and backsiphonage prevention device is necessary for the safety of the water system, the director will give notice in writing to the consumer to install such an approved device immediately. The consumer will install such approved device at his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install such device immediately, shall constitute a grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device has been installed.
(Code 1985, § 6-3-16(A))
Sec. 23-64. - Same—Where required.
(a)
Each service connection from the public water system supplying water to premises having an auxiliary water supply shall be protected against backflow of water from the premises into the public water system, unless the auxiliary water supply is accepted as an additional source by the water purveyor and such source is approved by the health authority.
(b)
Each service connection from the public water system supplying water to premises on which any substance is or may be handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the water system shall be protected against backflow of the water from the premises into the public system. This shall include premises having industrial piping systems, handling industrial fluids or progress waters, or waters originating from the public water supply system which have been subject to deterioration in sanitary quality.
(c)
Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on the service connection to any premises that have internal cross-connections unless such cross-connections are abated to the satisfaction of the water purveyor and approved by the state or local health department.
(Code 1985, § 6-3-16(B))
Sec. 23-65. - Same—Type.
(a)
The protective device shall provide protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. In determining the degree of hazard and the type of device required the consumer shall:
(1)
Make a comprehensive survey of water use practices within the customer's plant to determine whether there are any actual or potential cross-connections to the in-plant potable water system through which sewage, toxic chemicals or other fluids containing contaminants of a biological or chemical nature could backflow into the potable system.
(2)
When cross-connections are found or when it can be anticipated that cross-connections will, in all likelihood, be installed in the future or that in-plant backflow preventers are likely to be neglected and, as a result fail to prevent backflow, the inspector should determine whether permanent control at the point of cross-connection would be effective or whether a plan of cross-connection control by contaminant would be more effective.
(3)
Determine whether there are contaminants being handled on the premises and, if there are, whether they could, if ingested, create a health hazard or whether they would be considered to be a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable.
(b)
Once these three objectives have been attained, the degree of hazard can be evaluated and a backflow preventer commensurate with the degree of hazard can be chosen. For the guidance of all concerned, such determination shall be made in accordance with the following stated policy: In all cases where the interconnection may be subjected to a vacuum or to backpressure and where a backflow would result in creating a danger to public health; an air gap or a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed at the service connection. Where the air gap is used, an emergency bypass shall be installed with a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device installed therein.
(c)
An approved double check valve assembly or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer device may be used where there is an existing or potential pollutional hazard not dangerous to health.
(d)
In no case should a vacuum breaker be installed at the service connection.
(Code 1985, § 6-3-16(C))
