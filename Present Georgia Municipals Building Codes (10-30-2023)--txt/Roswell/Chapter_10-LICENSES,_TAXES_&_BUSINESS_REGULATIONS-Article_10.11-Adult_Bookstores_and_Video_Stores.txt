Article 10.11 - Adult Bookstores and Video Stores

Section 10.11.1 - Purposes and Findings.
Based on the experiences of other municipalities and counties, including, but not limited to Houston, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Dayton, Ohio; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Fulton County, Georgia which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Roswell, Georgia, and based on documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by law enforcement personnel during the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting on August 7, 2001, the mayor and council of the City of Roswell take note of the opportunity for unlawful sexual activities including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex to occur at adult bookstores and video stores which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or other reproductions depicting nudity, and for sexually transmitted diseases to spread as a result of the unhealthy conditions and unlawful activities associated with such booths, and the mayor and council further note that persons frequent such video viewing booths for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within such video viewing booths, and bodily fluids, including semen, urine and feces are found in such video viewing booths.
The mayor and council find that removal of doors on such video viewing booths and prohibiting holes between such booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in such booths. The mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the community to require that doors or other partitions on video viewing booths in adult bookstores and video stores be removed and that no holes be allowed to exist between adjoining booths. The mayor and council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing unlawful sexual activities and unhealthy conditions in video viewing booths found in adult bookstores and video stores. The mayor and council further find that these regulations will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this ordinance is hereby adopted.
