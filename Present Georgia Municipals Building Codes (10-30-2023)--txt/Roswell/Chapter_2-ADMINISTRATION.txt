Section 2.7.8 - Promoting Sustainability.
The City of Roswell (city) is a significant consumer of goods and services. The city desires to encourage the procurement of sustainable and environmentally preferred products and services. The City of Roswell Mayor and Council have resolved that the city will take an active role to promote the analysis of life cycle costs for products and services to encourage protection of the environment by showing preference for the procurement of sustainable products and services for the use in city operations.
(a)
In general, environmentally preferable products and services are those that would reduce negative effects on human health and environment when compared with the competing products and services. More specifically, this comparison would include consideration of all phases of the product's life cycle, including raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, operation, maintenance and disposal, including potential for reuse or ability to be recycled.
(b)
In practice, the objective is to purchase products that have been environmentally certified or eco-labeled because they have reduced environmental impact due to the way they are made, used, transported, stored, packaged and disposed. It means looking for products that do not harm human health, are less polluting and that minimize waste, maximize use of bio-based or recycled materials, conserve energy and water, and reduce the consumption of and disposal of hazardous materials.
(c)
Therefore, the City of Roswell will implement an environmentally preferable purchasing program that accounts for life cycle costs and gives preference to products that are recycled, recyclable and otherwise more environmentally friendly than traditional products; purchase Energy Star rated equipment and appliances when possible to do so and, purchase recycled copy, computer, and fax paper with at least thirty (30) percent recycled content whenever the use of the paper makes it possible to do so.

Section 2.7.14 - Competitive Sealed Proposals.
When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as:
(a)
When the quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or services;
(b)
When the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest;
(c)
If a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous; or
(d)
Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternative proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award.
The procedural steps for competitive sealed proposals shall be as follows:
(a)
Public notice shall be given as required by Georgia law, but in no event less than fourteen (14) days. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the city administrator or finance director. The advertisement shall state the time and place where specifications may be obtained, and the time and place for deadline for receipt of proposals. The advertisement shall state that the city reserves the right to reject any or all of the proposals.
(b)
Proposals shall be sealed. All proposals shall be received in public and the purchasing manager shall make or oversee the making of a record of the proposals received. The name of each proposer shall be announced but no other information shall be disclosed nor shall the proposals be considered an "open record" until a contract is awarded. The record of the proposals received shall be subject to public inspection after the deadline for receipt in the manner prescribed by law.
(c)
Award of contract shall be made to the proposer that submits the proposal deemed in the best interest of the city taking into account the evaluation factors outlined in the proposal documents. A team consisting of no less than three (3) persons shall evaluate and order rank proposals. This team shall include the purchasing manager, the head of the user department and an additional representative of the user department selected by the respective department head.
(d)
The purchasing manager may require the successful proposer to furnish a performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract. The performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and the form of the bond shall be included in the specifications. The city council may reject the bond of any proposer if they find it to be unacceptable.
(e)
All contracts of $25,000.00 or more, for professional services, to which this section applies shall be in writing and shall be approved by the city council. The city council may reject any and all bids.

Section 2.7.15 - Multi-Step Competitive Sealed Procurement.
The multi-step competitive sealed procurement method may be used when the city desires to award a contract not necessarily based on price, and when specifications may not be readily available or when technical qualifications are essential for the decision making process. This type shall take the form of requests for proposals (RFP) or request for information (RFI) and shall follow the following format. If time is of the essence, the two (2) steps can be combined with the priced offer submitted in a separate sealed envelope at the time of submission of the technical offer. The pricing data is to remain unopened until evaluation of technical offers is complete.
(a)
Public notice shall be given as required by Georgia law, but in no event less than fourteen (14) days. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the city administrator or finance director. The advertisement shall state the time and place where documents may be obtained, and the time and place for deadline for receipt of documents. The advertisement shall state that the city reserves the right to reject any or all documents received.
(b)
