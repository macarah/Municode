Article 13.2 - False Alarms[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2021-04-08 , § 1, repealed Art. 13.2 in its entirety, and § 2 of said ordinance enacted a new Art. 13.2 to read as herein set out. Former Art. 13.2, §§ 13.2.1—13.2.7, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the original codification.

Section 13.2.1 - Legislative Findings and Purpose of Article.
(a)
The mayor and council find that emergency response to false alarms creates additional risks to public safety by diverting limited public safety resources away from both real emergencies and normal patrol activities intended and designed to prevent criminal acts. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to promote public safety by making burglar and fire alarm users in the City of Roswell directly responsible for preventing false alarms.
(b)
Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm registration, the alarm user acknowledges that the city emergency services response may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels and prior response history.
