Repairs, maintenance, and restoration shall be allowed without conformity to any building or fire safety related code, standard, rule, or regulation, provided the building is brought into and remains in full compliance with this section.
(2)
In the case of fire or other casualty to a landmark museum building, it may be rebuilt, in total or in part, using such techniques and materials as are necessary to restore it to the condition prior to the fire or casualty and use as a totally preserved building.
(3)
If a historic building or structure, as a result of proposed work or changes in use, would become eligible and would be so certified as a landmark museum building, and the state historic preservation officer so certifies and such is submitted to the local fire and building code official with the construction or building permit application, then the work may proceed under the provisions of this section.
(c)
All landmark museum buildings shall comply with the following requirements:
(1)
Every landmark museum building shall have portable fire extinguishers as deemed appropriate by the local fire authority having jurisdiction based on the applicable state or local fire safety codes or regulations.
(2)
All landmark museum buildings which contain residential units shall have electrically powered smoke or products of combustion detectors installed within each living unit between living and sleeping areas. Such detectors shall be continuously powered by the building's electrical system. When activated, the detector shall initiate an alarm which is audible in sleeping rooms of that living unit. These unit detectors shall be required in addition to any other protective system that may be installed in the building.
(3)
For all landmark museum buildings, except those protected by a total automatic fire suppression system and one- and two-family dwellings, approved automatic fire warning protection shall be provided by installing at least one listed smoke or products of combustion detector for every 1,200 square feet of floor area per floor or story. In addition, all lobbies, common corridors, hallways, and ways of exit access shall be provided with listed smoke or products of combustion detectors not more than 30 feet apart. Detectors shall be so connected as to sound an alarm audible throughout the structure or building. With respect to buildings which are totally protected by an automatic fire suppression system, activation of the sprinkler system shall sound an alarm throughout the structure or building.
(4)
Smoke or products of combustion detectors shall be listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.
(5)
All multistory landmark museum buildings, except one- and two-family dwellings, with occupancy above or below the street or grade level, shall have manual fire alarm pull stations in the natural path of egress. The activation of a manual pull station shall cause the building fire warning system to sound.

Secs. 105-110—105-131. - Reserved.
ARTICLE IV. - FIRE DISTRICT

Sec. 105-132. - Legislative findings.
(a)
After review of the International Building Code, and the local climatic, geologic, topographic, and public safety factors concerning the downtown area of the city, the city council makes the legislative determination that it is in the best interest of the public welfare and safety of the city, that a fire district area be established for the downtown area of the city. The International Building Code, within appendix D of said Code, provides that it is optional for the governing authority to adopt the fire district provisions of appendix D (being essentially the provisions of this article), but the city council makes the legislative findings and determination that a fire district is appropriate for the downtown area due to the following factors:
(1)
The city, due to its geologic location and local climate, is more subject to ice and snow events than most of the state;
(2)
The city is subject to earthquakes, and the density of development of the downtown area would call for greater fire protection;
(3)
The topography of the downtown district is such that firefighting abilities are hampered by the slope of the natural terrain;
(4)
The access to the buildings in the downtown area is hindered by a narrow street network that negatively impacts access by emergency vehicles;
(5)
The proximity of the buildings in the downtown area to overhead power lines makes access to the buildings from the street by laddering a safety hazard;
(6)
And the city's zoning ordinance allows buildings within the downtown area to be constructed with no sideline setback.
(b)
Due to these legislative findings, the city, by and through its city council, finds that it is appropriate to create a fire district for the downtown area, and as provided hereinafter.
