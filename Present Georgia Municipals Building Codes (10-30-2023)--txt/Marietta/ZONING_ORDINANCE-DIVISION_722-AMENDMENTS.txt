DIVISION 722 - AMENDMENTS

722.01 - Generally.
A.
This article, including the Official Zoning Map, may be amended by the City Council on its own motion, or on recommendation of the Planning Commission, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or been submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation; provided, however, that after any such amendment has been submitted to and reviewed by the Planning Commission and its recommendation made thereon, the City Council shall have the right to modify such amendment or place conditions thereon, and it shall not be necessary to resubmit such amendment, as modified or conditioned, to the Planning Commission. Before enacting an amendment to this article, the City Council shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon.
B.
Application to amend this article may be in the form of proposals to amend the text or Official Zoning Map. Unless initiated by the City Council or Planning Commission, all applications for map amendments must be submitted by the owner (as determined by controlling at least a 51% interest in the property) or the authorized agent of such property. An application for an amendment affecting the same property shall not be submitted more than once every 6 months; however, this provision shall not apply to those properties affected by an amendment filed by the City Council or Planning Commission.
(Code 1996, § 7-8-2-22-010)
722.02 - Application for map amendments.
A.
Each application to amend the Official Zoning Map shall be filed with the Department of Planning and Zoning at least 31 days (or less at staff discretion) prior to the Planning Commission hearing at which they may be heard. Each application shall include such information as the Planning and Zoning Director may require including, but not limited to:
1.
a legal description of the tract(s) proposed to be rezoned;
2.
a plat showing the dimensions, acreage and location of the tract(s) prepared by an architect, engineer, landscape architect or land surveyor whose state registration is current and valid (his seal shall be affixed to the plat);
3.
the present and proposed zoning classification for the tract(s);
4.
the name(s) and address(es) of the owners of the land and their agents, if any;
5.
a copy of the recorded warranty deed (or other instrument of title) which vested title to the property in the applicant;
6.
a copy of the paid in full tax bill or a letter from the City of Marietta Tax Department stating that all taxes have been paid; and
7.
a site plan showing any and all proposed improvements to be constructed if the application is approved.
B.
This application shall be accompanied by a fee to partially defray the public expense of processing the application. A fee shall not be charged if an official governmental agency files the application or if the rezoning is a result of O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq., which requires all annexed properties to have a zoning hearing, provided said hearing designates a zoning classification which is the most equivalent to the existing county zoning.
C.
No submitted application may be amended after public notice of the request has been given provided, however, the Planning Commission and City Council may allow such application to be amended during the public hearing.
D.
The applicant or agent shall be present at the hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council with regard to said application. In the event that an agent is present, rather than the applicant, such agent must have full authority to act on behalf of the applicant with regard to all matters pertaining to said application.
E.
The applicant shall be allowed to submit renderings, site plans and other exhibits purporting to depict what is to be constructed should a map amendment be approved; however, the applicant may be required to develop according to such plans if approved by the City Council. Any deviation from such approved plans would require another rezoning application be filed. The City Council may also require or attach to any rezoning such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so as to improve the quality of life through the protection against air, water and noise pollution and promotion of aesthetic considerations.
F.
An application may not be withdrawn by the applicant within 48 hours prior to a hearing on the matter, however, the City Council may, by a majority of the members present, allow an application to be withdrawn without prejudice with respect to the 6-month limitation, or allow an application to be amended. Failure of the applicant or their representative to appear at the scheduled hearing may result in automatic dismissal with prejudice, rejection of the application or continuance of the hearing at the sole discretion of the Planning Commission or City Council.
