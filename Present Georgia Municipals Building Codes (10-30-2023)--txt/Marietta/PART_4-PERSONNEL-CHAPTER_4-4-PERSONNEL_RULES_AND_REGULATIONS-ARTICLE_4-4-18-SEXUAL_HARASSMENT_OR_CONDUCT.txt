4-4-18-010 - Policy.
A.
Sexual harassment is a form of employee misconduct which undermines the integrity of the work environment. Sexual harassment is also a form of sex discrimination in violation of various federal and state civil rights laws.
B.
It is the policy of the city/BLW to seek prevention of sexual harassment of its employees and applicants for employment.
(Code 1978, § 4-111; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
4-4-18-020 - Rights and responsibilities.
In order to preserve the rights of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual harassment and, also, to protect the legitimate privacy interests of innocent parties, the city/BLW will provide a method for the confidential resolution of sexual harassment complaints. All parties should but are not required to exhaust the informal remedies described herein before they resort to the formal grievance procedure.
A.
Supervisory Responsibilities. Supervisors are responsible for maintaining a positive work environment, setting a good example for others and promptly investigating all complaints of sexual harassment to determine what, if any, remedial action may be warranted. In resolving sexual harassment complaints, supervisors should seek advice and guidance from the human resources director and cooperate fully with his efforts to resolve any complaints referred to the human resources director by other parties. Supervisors should strive first and foremost to prevent any recurrence of prohibited activities or retaliation against victims.
B.
Aggrieved Employee/Applicant Responsibilities.
1.
An aggrieved party should try to tell the aggressor directly that his behavior is unwelcome, harmful or offensive to the aggrieved party. Some offenders may be genuinely oblivious to the effect of their words or conduct on other people and would be willing to change if only they knew they were hurting or offending someone. Aggrieved parties are strongly encouraged to promptly report the incident to the offender's supervisor or department head, or alternatively to the human resources department, so as to minimize the risk of repeated incidents or retaliation by the aggressor. Although supervisors and managers of the city/BLW are to take appropriate action when they have reason to suspect that harassment has occurred, employees should not assume that the city/BLW is aware of any problem. It is also the employee's responsibility to bring any complaint to the attention of the management of the city/BLW so that the problem may be resolved.
2.
Aggrieved parties should make reasonable, good faith efforts to resolve their complaints before they resort to the formal grievance process. However, failure to do so does not preclude resorting to the formal grievance procedure and/or disciplinary action or any other resolution by the appropriate manager as a result of such grievance.
C.
Human Resources Director Responsibilities.
1.
The human resources director shall facilitate the resolution of any complaints brought to his attention. Upon request, the human resources director will provide counseling and support to victims, supervisors and other involved parties. The human resources director shall serve as expert advisor to any supervisor who is part of the reviewing procedure in the formal grievance process. In this capacity, the director shall offer his best professional judgment as to whether certain allegations, if true, would constitute sexual harassment.
2.
The human resources director is responsible for providing training to city/BLW supervisors and managers on the subject of sexual harassment. The training should provide supervisors with current information on applicable laws, rules, regulations and procedures and provide techniques for the careful investigation and mediation of sexual harassment allegations.

Provides false witness against another;
shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action including, but not limited to, referral to professional counseling at the offending party's expense; oral and written reprimands, performance probation, suspension or termination.
B.
Some coercive behavior, such as threats or promises that employment reprisals or wards will follow the refusal or granting of sexual favors, constitutes gross misconduct and may provide just cause of immediate termination.
(Code 1978, § 4-1115; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96)
