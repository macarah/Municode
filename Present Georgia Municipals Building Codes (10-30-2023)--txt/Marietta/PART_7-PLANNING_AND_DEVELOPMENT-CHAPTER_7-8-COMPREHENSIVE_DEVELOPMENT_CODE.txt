No ordinance designating any property as historic property, or any ordinance designating any district as a historic district, nor any amendments thereto may be adopted by the council, nor may any property be accepted or acquired as historic property by the council, unless all procedural requirements have been met as set forth in this subsection.
A.
Requirements for Designation. In designating property as historic property or as a historic district, the council and commission shall comply with the notice requirements set forth in Section 7-8-9-040.
1.
Designation of Historic Property. Subject to Subsection B., below, in designating a property as a historic property, the commission shall set forth the name or names of the owners of the property, and shall require that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained from the commission prior to any material change in the appearance of the designated property, as set forth in Section 7-8-9-020 L.1.—5., except as noted in City of Marietta Code Section 7-8-9-050. Prior to any designation of a historic property, the owner or owners of the private property shall be given the opportunity to concur in or object to the designation. If the owner of the private property does not consent to the proposed historic designation, the historic property cannot be listed as a historic property under this chapter. Additionally, where the owner or owners of private property consent to the nomination, the rules and or guidelines under which they have consented to the designation may not thereafter be changed to be more restrictive without the consent of the owner or owners of the historic property.
2.
Designation of Historic District. Subject to Subsection B., below, designation of a district as a historic district shall include a description of the boundaries of the district, shall list each property located therein, shall set forth the name or names of the owners of each property, and shall require that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained from the historic preservation commission prior to any material change in the appearance of any structure, site, or work of art located within the designated historic district, as set forth in Section 7-8-9-020 M.1.—5., except as noted in City of Marietta Code Section 7-8-9-050. Prior to any designation of a historic district, owners of private properties shall be given an opportunity to concur in or object to the designation. If at least 60 percent of private property owners within a proposed district do not consent to the nomination, the area cannot be designated as a historic district. Additionally, where the 60 percent of the private owners within a proposed district consent to the nomination, the rules and or guidelines under which they have consented to the designation may not thereafter be changed to be more restrictive without the consent of at least 60 percent of the private property owners within that district.
3.
Each property owner within the proposed historic district shall have one vote per parcel of property owned by such owner. If a parcel of property is owned by more than one person or legal entity, the vote of the "owner" of that property shall be the vote of the majority of owners.
4.
If the parcel of property is a substandard lot (as defined by the City of Marietta Zoning Ordinance or a nonbuildable lot) and there is no structure built on the lot and it is vacant of any business or residence, there shall be no vote allowed for said parcel.
5.
A vote on a district (or a substantially similar district) shall not be conducted more than once every 12 months. The voting on a district shall be open for only a 60-day period from the time that notice or voting cards are mailed. The vote shall take place only after the guidelines are approved and the proposed district boundaries have been delineated by the Historic Preservation Commission.
6.
A property owner may not change his or her vote once it has been cast or returned to the city.
7.
a.
Voting cards or ballots shall be sent by certified mail to each owner that is eligible to vote as set forth herein for property that is within the proposed district mailed to the last address shown, on the ad valorem tax records of the City of Marietta for the most current year the city has in its possession. A letter giving notice that voting is taking place in the proposed historic district shall be sent via regular mail to "occupant" to the property address.
b.
Voting cards or ballots must be returned within 60 days to the director of the Department of Development Services.
c.
Approval of the vote by property owners in the proposed historic district shall mean that the affirmative vote of the total eligible to vote to approve or vote for the district by the required percentage set forth in Section 7-8-9-040 A.2.
B.
Procedural Steps for Designation as Historical Property or District. No ordinance designating any property as a historic property and no ordinance designating any district as an historic district, nor any amendments thereto may be adopted by council nor may any property be accepted or acquired as historic property by council until the following procedural steps are taken:
1.
The commission shall, subject to city council approval, make or cause to be made an investigation and shall report on the historic, cultural, architectural, or aesthetic significance of each place, district, site, building, structure, or work of art proposed for designation or acquisition. This report shall be submitted to the division of historic preservation of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources or its successor which will be allowed 30 days to prepare written comments concerning the report;
2.
The commission and council shall each hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance and a public hearing on the design guidelines. Notice of the hearing(s) for the ordinance shall be published at least three times in the principal newspaper of general circulation within the City of Marietta; and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed to all owners and occupants of such properties. Notice of the hearing(s) for the guidelines shall be published at least one time in the principal newspaper of general circulation within the City of Marietta; and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed to all owners and occupants of such properties. All the notices shall be published or mailed not less than ten nor more than 20 days prior to the date set for the public hearing; and
3.
Following the public hearing, council may adopt the ordinance as prepared, adopt the ordinance with any amendments it deems necessary, or reject the proposal.
C.
Notice to Owner/Occupiers. Within 30 days immediately following the adoption of the ordinance the owners and occupants of each designated historic property and the owners and occupants of each structure, site, or work of art located within a designated historic district shall be given written notification of such designation by the council, which notice shall apprise said owners and occupants of the necessity for obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change, as set forth herein, in the appearance of the historic property designated or within the historic district designated.
D.
Approval of Guidelines. Design guidelines or preservation guidelines must be approved by both the Historic Preservation Commission and city council at least one meeting prior to the establishment of a historic district or designation of a historic property that would be required to comply with said guidelines.
E.
Adoption into Zoning Map. The designated property or district shall be listed by the planning and zoning director on the official zoning map of the City of Marietta or, in the absence of an official zoning map, the designated property or district shall be shown on a map of the city and kept as a public record in the city clerk's office to provide notice of such designation in addition to other notice requirements specified by this article.
F.
Except as may hereinafter be modified, the city council may remove the designation as a historic property or historic district by a majority vote of those council members voting.
G.
An historic district may be amended by the addition of properties of property owners who have consented in writing to the addition of their properties, who have acknowledged in writing receipt of the historic preservation ordinance and guidelines and who have waived in writing all other notices. The commission and council shall each hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance of which the properties of said owners have consented to be included as an addition to the said historic district. The property or properties may be included in the existing district by first a majority vote of the commission and then a majority vote of the council. There will be no action required of the existing properties within the historic district for an amendment adding additional properties under the same guidelines. The properties comprising the amended addition will be subject to the ordinance as if part of the original formation of the historic district.

7-8-9-050 - Application for certificate of appropriateness.
A.
The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness unless it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historical, architectural, or cultural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district; notwithstanding the above, the proposed improvements may be approved if the project is of special merit by virtue of exemplary architecture, materials, and/or specific features that enhance the beauty and value of the property and the neighborhood to a greater extent than the existing property.
B.
Certificates of appropriateness are required before any of the following is commenced within the historic district except as set forth herein:
1.
The demolition of any historic building. Proved, however, that the action of the historic preservation commission shall constitute a recommendation and no certificate of appropriateness hereunder shall become final until approved by the Marietta City Council. Further provided, however, that any certificate of appropriateness approved by the city council must be implemented by commencement of substantial and ongoing construction within the period of 12 months from the date of final approval by the city council and if substantial and ongoing construction is not so commenced the final certificate issued by the city council shall expire and be void at the end of the 12-month period. Further provided that the city manager or his designee may grant a six-month extension of the certificate of appropriateness based upon a written request of the applicant. The following additional requirements shall be met:
a.
Except as provided in subparagraph c., below, any applicant requesting a demolition permit shall be required to provide a date certain for the commencement of new construction of a new building to replace the demolished building which shall be no greater than 90 days from the completion of demolition.
b.
Any applicant requesting a demolition permit shall be required to brick, stucco or otherwise reface any and all deteriorating walls that are open to public viewing as part of the demolition permit if no date certain exists to build a new structure or if due to other circumstances a new structure cannot be built in a manner provided in subparagraph a., above.
c.
Any applicant requesting a demolition permit who certifies that a new building will not be constructed on the demolition site shall restore the site within 30 days of completion of demolition to a condition which is safe, properly drained, stabilized, grassed and otherwise in compliance with the Marietta City Code. The city manager or his designee is hereby authorized to grant a 30-day extension based upon a request from the applicant.
2.
Any new construction of a principal building; or new accessory building or structure subject to view from a public street or walk;
3.
Additions or changes adding to existing fences, steps, sidewalks, streets and paving, or construction of a new fence, steps, sidewalks, streets and paving, subject to view from a public street or walk;

5.
The painting of exterior unpainted surfaces subject to view from a public street or walk.
C.
Application Requirement. After the designation by ordinance of a historic property or of a historic district as set forth in Section 7-8-9-040, no material change in the appearance of the historic property or of a historic structure, site, or work of art within the historic district, as defined in Section 7-8-9-020 M.1.—5., and referenced in Section 7-8-9-050 B., shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof unless and until application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the commission, except as set forth herein.
1.
Such application shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, plans, or other documentation showing the proposed exterior changes or new construction, where necessary. Detailed drawings shall not be required.
D.
Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this article:
1.
The department of transportation and any contractors, including cities and counties, performing work funded by the department of transportation are exempt from this article.
2.
Local governments are exempt from the requirements of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness; provided, however, that local government shall notify the commission 45 days prior to beginning an undertaking that would otherwise require a certificate of appropriateness and allow the commission an opportunity to comment.
3.
Minor repairs:
i.
Minor repairs that do not alter the historic or architectural features existing on the building. Examples of items falling within this category, which do not require a certificate of appropriateness, are the following:
a.
The painting of existing surfaces where the surface was previously painted;
b.
A change in color to a previously painted surface;
c.
New roofs or caps on roofs which are not visible from public rights-of-way and which do not change the character of the roof;
d.
Roof repair or replacement where the color is the same as the roof it replaced or gray or black or white;

The replacement of HVAC where such replacement is in the same location and of the same scale (or slightly larger to accommodate higher energy efficient equipment) as that of the original equipment. Excluded from the exception in this paragraph are window units;
f.
The replacement of gutters where the replacement is in the same location and of the same scale as that of the original equipment;

The replacement of historic windows (nonhistoric windows would be exempt) with like kind;
j.
New gutters where none existed before.
ii.
In the event an applicant is not certain about whether an item requires a certificate of appropriateness or not, an application shall be submitted to staff for review. In the event staff determines that they have the authority to approve the application because the change to the building is a minor repair, as defined in this section, then staff is given the authority to do so. In the event staff is not certain about whether the application would be considered a minor repair or a structural change then staff shall submit the application to the commission for consideration.
E.
Effective Period. Except for a final certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., once a certificate of appropriateness has been approved, the action permitted under the certificate shall be commenced within three years. However, if a project under consideration for a certificate of appropriateness is submitted in phases and may be commenced accordingly, each phase shall be good for successive period of three years (i.e., three years for the first phase, three years for the second phase, etc.). The certificate of appropriateness may be renewed prior to expiration of the terms set forth herein by application to the commission for renewal. Said renewals shall be granted unless there are significant changes in the district that would be adverse to the granting of the renewal. Notwithstanding any other provision under this code section, all actions permitted shall be governed by the applicable construction codes and ancillary ordinances governing construction as of the date of the issuance of the permit.
F.
Variances. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meeting of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that the architectural or historic integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. Variances for undue hardship shall only be granted where the undue hardship arises from circumstances not caused, controlled, or contributed to by the owner or occupant. Variances may also be issued for projects deemed to have "special merit" as described in Section 7-8-9-50 A.
G.
Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness has 30 days to appeal such determination to the city council. The council or other governing body may approve, modify and approve, or reject the determination made by the commission if the council or other governing body found that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Further appeal may be taken in the manner provided by Georgia law.
H.
Enforcement and Penalty for Violation.
1.
Once a certificate of appropriateness has been issued, the work must conform to the certificate as issued. Failure to comply shall be grounds for the building inspector or the commission to issue a cease and desist order.
2.
The city council, commission, or building inspector shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in the appearance of a designated historic property or district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of an ordinance adopted in conformity with this article, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. Violations of any ordinance adopted in conformity with this article shall be punished in the same manner as provided by charter or local law for the punishment of violations under zoning ordinance Section 718.08.
I.
Effect on Building and Demolition Permits. Any activity that does not require a building permit will not be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness. Also, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit or demolition permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officials charged with issuing such permits; and, in such case, no permit shall be issued.

The commission has no authority to review such interior arrangements in its review of applications for certificate of appropriateness.
3.
Exempt Material Changes. Nothing in this article shall require a certificate of appropriateness or be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a historic property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a material change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent any property owner or occupant from making any use of his property not prohibited by other laws, ordinances, or regulations. Refer to Section 7-8-9-050 C. for a listing of specific exemptions.
C.
Rejection of Applications. Except for a final certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., in the event the commission denies an application, or recommends denial pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., it shall state its reasons for doing so at the meeting and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefore, in writing, to the applicant within seven days of the meeting. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if so desired, may make modifications to the plan and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
D.

Following the review period, the commission shall present its recommendation at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city council, pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1. Except for a certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., evidence of approval shall be by recommendation of a certificate of appropriateness by the commission.

1.
The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the public works director or designee. If floodway data is not available from the public works director or designee, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the public works director or designee.
2.
Following a pre-design conference with the public works director or designee, the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the (development or stormwater) site plan containing existing topographic information.
C.
General Standards.
1.
No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following:
a.
Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;
b.
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity;
c.
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or
d.
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
2.
Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of the future-conditions flood hazard allowed above shall also meet the following conditions:
a.
Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-conditions flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
b.
Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent;
c.
Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;
d.
Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of Section 7-8-10-040 D.;
e.
Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and
f.
Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the public works director or designee using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR).
D.
Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the public works director or designee prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
1.
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
2.
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the public works director or designee. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and future-conditions flood profiles;
3.
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; and
4.
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
E.
Floodway Encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in Subsection 2. below.
2.
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
3.
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the public works director or designee until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the public works director or designee.
F.
Maintenance Requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The public works director or designee may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the public works director or designee.
The property owner's failure to maintain facilities will be considered a violation of this article.

A.
Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the city council. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
B.
Any person adversely affected by any decision of the city council shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Cobb County Superior Court in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the city council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard.
C.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Cobb County Superior Court, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
D.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
E.
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
F.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
G.
In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
H.
Conditions for Variances.
1.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
2.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
3.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the city council specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided; and
4.
The public works director or designee shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
I.
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the public works director or designee and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
J.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
K.
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact".

7-8-12-040 - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
A.
General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
B.
Minimum Requirements/BMPs.
1.
Best management practices as set forth in Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C. shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph 2. of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
2.
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
3.
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
4.
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
5.
The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Subsections C.15., 16. and 17., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c) (City of Marietta Stream Buffer Protection Ordinance, Article 7-10).
C.
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
1.
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
2.
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
3.
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
4.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
5.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
6.
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
7.
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
8.
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
9.
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
10.
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
11.
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
12.
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
13.
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
14.
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 7-8-12-040 B.2.;
15.
Except as provided in paragraphs 16. and 17. of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except:
(1)
Where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8; or
(2)
Where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented;
(3)
Where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or
(4)
Along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer (City of Marietta Stream Buffer Protection Ordinance, Article 7-10):
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines;
16.
There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines;
17.
There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the coastal marshland buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, "maintenance" shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction.
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a coastal marshland buffer and a coastal marshland buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a coastal marshland buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a coastal marshland buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
b.
The coastal marshland buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the coastal marshland buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented;
c.
The coastal marshland buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this article and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot coastal marshland buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; and
d.
Activities where the area within the coastal marshland buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of coastal marshland buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved coastal marshland buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities.
D.
Nothing contained in this article shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C.
E.
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(Ord. No. 8051, 10/10/2018, § 1)
7-8-12-050 - Application/permit process.
A.
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review before submittal the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, stream buffer protection ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
B.
Application Requirements.
1.
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the public works department to perform such activity and providing a copy of an NOI submitted to EPD, if applicable.
2.
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the public works department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 7-8-12-050 C. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C. will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by a copy of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
3.
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
4.
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by Sections 7-8-12-040 C.15., 16. and 17. have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Section 7-8-12-050 B.6., have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
5.
If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
6.
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
C.
Plan Requirements.
1.
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C., or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

(Ord. No. 8051, 10/10/2018, § 1)
7-8-12-060 - Inspection and enforcement.
A.
The public works department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities, as defined herein, has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
B.
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
C.
The public works department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
D.
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
E.
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
F.
The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

Site reconnaissance and surveying techniques shall be used to complete a thorough assessment of existing natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic, found on the site. Resources to be identified, mapped, and shown on the Stormwater Management Plan, shall include, at a minimum, as applicable:
1.
Topography, with a minimum of two-foot contours, and steep slopes, i.e., areas with slopes greater than 15 percent;
2.
Natural drainage divides and patterns;
3.
Natural drainage features, e.g., swales, basins, depressional areas;
4.
Natural feature protection and conservation areas such as wetlands, lakes, ponds, floodplains, stream buffers, drinking water wellhead protection areas and river corridors;
5.
Predominant soils, including erodible soils and karst areas; and
6.
Existing predominant vegetation including trees, high quality habitat and other existing vegetation.
C.
Better Site Design Practices for Stormwater Management. Stormwater management plans shall preserve the natural drainage and natural treatment systems and reduce the generation of additional stormwater runoff and pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. Additional details can be found in the GSMM Section 2.3.
D.
Stormwater Runoff Quality/Reduction. Stormwater runoff quality/reduction shall be provided by using the following:
1.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted before December 10, 2020, the applicant may choose either:
a.
Runoff reduction; or
b.
Water quality.
2.
For development with a stormwater management plan submitted on or after December 10, 2020, the applicant shall choose a. runoff reduction and additional water quality shall not be required. To the extent a. runoff reduction has been determined to be infeasible for all or a portion of the site using the practicability policy, then b. water quality shall apply for the remaining runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event and must be treated to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM.
a.
Runoff Reduction. The stormwater management system shall be designed to retain the first one inch of rainfall on the site using runoff reduction methods, to the maximum extent practicable.
b.
Water Quality. The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load or equivalent as defined in the GSMM for runoff from a 1.2 inch rainfall event.
3.
If a site is determined to be a hotspot as detailed in Section 7-8-14-010(D), the City of Marietta may require the use of specific or additional components for the stormwater management system to address pollutants of concern generated by that site.
E.
Stream Channel Protection. Stream channel protection shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches:
1.
Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event;
2.

Overbank Flood Protection. Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event.
G.
Extreme Flood Protection. Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated.
H.
Downstream Analysis. Due to peak flow timing and runoff volume effects, some structural components of the stormwater management system fail to reduce discharge peaks to pre-development levels downstream from the site. A downstream peak flow analysis shall be provided to the point in the watershed downstream of the site or the stormwater management system where the area of the site comprises ten percent of the total drainage area in accordance with Section 3.1.9 of the GSMM. This is to help ensure that there are minimal downstream impacts from development on the site. The downstream analysis may result in the need to resize structural components of the stormwater management system.
I.
Stormwater Management System Inspection and Maintenance. The components of the stormwater management system that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the City of Marietta, including all drainage facilities, best management practices, credited conservation spaces, and conveyance systems, shall have an inspection and maintenance agreement to ensure that they continue to function as designed. All new development and redevelopment sites are to prepare a comprehensive inspection and maintenance agreement for the on-site stormwater management system.
