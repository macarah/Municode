DIVISION 730 - DESIGN STANDARDS

730.01 - Streets.
A.
The arrangement, character, extent, locations, and grade of all streets shall be done in accordance with acceptable land planning principles and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, orientation to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets. All proposed streets shall be designed in a manner which does not promote congestion. Single-family developments containing more than 51 dwelling units, multi family developments containing more than 100 dwelling units and non-residential developments containing greater than 51,000 gross square feet shall provide at least 2 access points to arterial or collector streets.
B.
The street pattern shall be in conformity with the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood area. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided and provide normal circulation of traffic within the vicinity. Except where topographic conditions warrant, block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet.
C.
Subdivisions which abut or have included within the proposed area to be subdivided any arterial roadway as shown on the City's Official Thoroughfare Map shall provide those treatments necessary for adequate protection residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. Intersections of minor subdivision streets with arterials shall be held to a minimum.
D.
Unusable Reserve Strips. Unusable reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited. Land shall not be subdivided in a manner which omits part of the original tract or avoids drainage improvements.
E.
Cul-de-sacs. Streets designed to have 1 end permanently closed shall provide a turnaround having a minimum roadway diameter of 80 feet and right-of-way diameter of 100 feet. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 700 feet in length.
F.
Required Right-of-way Widths, Paving Widths and Grades. The amount of right-of-way deemed reasonable to be required by dedication shall not exceed 100 feet in width. Along both sides of proposed major arterial streets, it is deemed reasonable to require an increased front setback of up to 20 feet more than that required by the zoning ordinance. Table L denotes the minimum specifications for all streets unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director:

Paving Specifications. Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, all of the materials, method of construction and workmanship for work covered in reference to street construction shall conform to the latest specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation.
1.
Residential local streets—The base course shall consist of 5 inches of crushed stone base material thoroughly compacted and brought to grade. The base shall be primed with 0.25 gallon of R.C. 70 bituminous prime material per square yard and the prime shall be cured until it does not pick up under traffic, in no case shall the curing period be less than 24 hours. After the prime is cured, 2 inches of "B" binder shall be applied. A final 1 inch of "F" topping with a tack coat shall be applied to the binder course at the rate of 0.05 gallon per square yard shall be applied as a wearing course when any of the following occurs:
a)
Ninety percent of the houses on the street are completed.
b)
The maintenance agreement or bond between the developer and the City is within 1 month of expiring.
c)
The Public Works Director approves or orders the final topping course to be applied.
2.
Streets other than local residential streets—One of the following combinations of base course, binder, and topping must be used:
a)
Eight-inch crushed stone base, 2 inches of "B" binder and 1½ inches of "F" topping; or
b)
Six inches crushed stone base, 3½ inches "B" binder and 1½ inches of "F" topping.
c)
Prime and tack shall be placed in the same amount and time frame as for residential local streets outlined above. The final topping coat shall be applied when 1 of the following occurs:
1)
Ninety percent of the lots are developed or 90% of the development is complete where land is not subdivided.
2)
The maintenance agreement or bond between the developer and the city is within 1 month of expiring.
3)
The Public Works Director approves or orders the final topping course to be applied.
H.
Alignment and Visibility.
1.
Minimum radii of horizontal curvature of the centerline shall be not less than 100 feet.
2.
Tangent lengths between reverse curves shall be approved by the Public Works Director. A minimum tangent of 100 feet shall be introduced between reverse curves on major arterials.
3.
Visibility. Clear horizontal visibility, measured along the centerline, shall be provided for at least 400 feet on major arterials; 300 feet on minor arterials; 200 feet on collector and local streets.
I.
Intersections.
1.
Submission of a grading plan, showing existing conditions and a detailed design for intersections which are unusual or located on different terrain may be required by the Public Works Director.
2.
Acute angles at street intersections are to be avoided and in no case will an angle of less than 60 degrees be permitted.
3.
Minimum radii of intersections.
a)
Property lines at all street intersections shall have chords in place of a radius. The chords shall connect the points where the radii for beginning and end of curb radius intersects the right-of-way lines.
b)
Roadway and curb intersections shall be made concentric and shall be rounded by a radius of not less than 25 feet.
4.
Location of intersections.
a)
Intersections of new subdivision streets with arterial and collector streets must be aligned with existing street intersections located along the frontage of the proposed project. The Public Works Director may approve other intersection locations when it is determined that alignment with an existing intersection is not appropriate.
b)
Acceleration and deceleration lanes are required to be constructed when new subdivision streets intersect with arterial and collector streets. Deceleration lanes and acceleration lanes must be a minimum lane width of 12 feet wide with 24 inches curb and gutter and a minimum length of 200 feet including 50 foot taper. Tapers on auxiliary lanes may be reduced or squared off on non-curbed roadways where lane extensions or widening is expected and on curbed roadways where its does not present a problem to traffic maneuverability, safety, drainage and sidewalk tie-ins. However, a painted delineation taper (50 ft.) must be provided in these conditions. In all cases auxiliary lanes shall be designed in accordance to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. The Public Works Director may approve reduced dimensions based upon existing site conditions.
