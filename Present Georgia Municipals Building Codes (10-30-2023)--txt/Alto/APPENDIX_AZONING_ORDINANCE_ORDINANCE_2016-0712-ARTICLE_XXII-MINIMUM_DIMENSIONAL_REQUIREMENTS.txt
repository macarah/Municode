  ** See Article XI, Section 1103 and 1104.
Measurements for all setbacks are taken beginning from the end of the right-of-way.
NOTE: Additional setbacks may be required for specified uses as provided in permitted uses sections of particular zoning districts or as to special uses granted by permit.
(A)
When development in this district abuts an A, R-I, R-II, or R-IV zoning district boundary, a vegetative buffer with a minimum width of five (5) feet and six (6) feet in height shall be provided along the entire property line abutting said zoning district.
(B)
When development in this district abuts an A, R-I, R-II, or R-IV zoning district boundary, a vegetative buffer with a minimum width of five (5) feet and six (6) feet in height shall be provided along the entire property line abutting said district. A five (5) foot vegetative wide buffer shall be required when this district abuts an R-3, MHP or O-P zoning district.
(C)
When development within this district abuts an A, R-I, R-II or R-IV zoning district boundary, a vegetative buffer with a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet shall be provide along the entire property line abutting said zoning district. A twenty (20) foot wide vegetative buffer shall be required when this district abuts an R-3, MHP or O-P zoning district.
How many square feet in an acre?
There are 43,560 square feet in one acre.
To determine the acreage size of your lot, divide the total square footage by 43,560.
For example, a lot is 110 feet wide by 115 deep.
• 110 x 115 = 12,650 square feet
• 12,650 ÷ 43,560 = 0.29 acre
If you have 110.25 acres:
• 110.25 x 43,560 = 4,802, 490 square feet

  ** Additional density could be allowed by variance in the form of a credit for consumption of (REUSE) non-potable water usage in business application and/or land application, but will expire upon consumption decline or abandonment of service. To be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Town Council depending upon availability services.
Sustainable Growth Design and Application is intended to allow for the above-mentioned criteria and the application of design & application procedures creating performance based planning as follows: a reduction in infrastructure needs, an enhancement of transportation needs and/or alternatives, improvement of community land use reducing the immediate impact on surrounding property by an increase in overall setbacks for the exterior of the development, enhancement for reduction of environmental impact, requiring submittal of watershed protection, urban reuse, slope and grade study and storm water management with site plan development. This application is not limited to residential application and should be explored for commercial and industrial application. The design and application lend themselves to conservation and allow for new development to be measured for numerous aspects of impact allowing for a reduction in development cost, a reduction in short and long term maintenance, and a benefit to the future property owners in sustaining values to the tax digest and the community taxpayers. Such developments will be considered in the planned development districts.
