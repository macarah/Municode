Sec. 5-56. - Precautions to be taken by owners of vicious animals or fowl.
(a)
No person owning or having custody or control of any dog or other animal/fowl known by such person to be vicious, dangerous or potentially dangerous shall permit it to run at large, or permit it to run loose on or within the premises of such person in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any person lawfully entering such premises.
(b)
It shall be the duty of every owner of any vicious animal/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, or anyone having any animal in his possession or custody, to ensure that the vicious animal/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog is kept under restraint as prescribed in subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section and that reasonable care and precautions are taken to prevent the vicious animal/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog from leaving, while unattended, the real property limits of its owner, custodian or harborer, and it is securely and humanely enclosed within a house, building, fence, locked pen, or other enclosure out of which it cannot climb, dig, jump, or otherwise escape on its own volition; and such enclosure must be securely locked at any time the animal is left unattended so that children are prevented from entry and to prevent the vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog from escaping.
(c)
For owners of vicious animals/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog who maintain their animal/fowl out-of-doors, a portion of their property should be fenced with a perimeter of area fence. Within this perimeter fence, the vicious animal/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog must be humanely confined inside a locked pen or kennel of adequate size. The pen or kennel may not share common fencing with the area or perimeter fence. The kennel or pen must have secure sides; a secure top attached to all sides; the sides must be securely set into the ground or onto a concrete pad, or securely attached to a wire bottom. The gate to the kennel must be locked when the animal is unattended. This enclosure shall provide protection from the elements.
(d)
A vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog shall not be upon any street or public place except when securely restrained by a leash not more than six (6) feet in length and humanely muzzled when appropriate, as determined by the animal control officer, and in the charge of a competent person.
(e)
Whenever outside of its enclosure as provided for in subsections (b) and (c), but on the owner's property, a vicious animal or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog must be attended by the owner and restrained by a secure collar, muzzled when appropriate, as determined by the animal control officer, and leash of sufficient strength to prevent escape.
(f)
No vicious animal/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog shall be chained, tethered, or otherwise tied to any inanimate object such as a tree, post, or building, outside of its primary enclosure.
(g)
A warning sign (i.e., "Beware of Dog") shall be conspicuously posted denoting a vicious animal/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog is on the premises. These signs are exempt from building permit requirements.
(h)
Failure to keep any animal/fowl or dangerous or potentially dangerous dog confined or under restraint as provided for in the section shall be unlawful and shall be punishable as hereinafter provided.

At the hearing, the owner of the dog shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence, and, in addition thereto, the hearing board shall receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as the hearing board may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify, or overrule the animal control officer's classification of the dog.

(f)
Issuance of a certificate of registration or the renewal of a certificate of registration by the animal control officer does not warrant or guarantee that the requirements specified in section 5-56 of this chapter are maintained by the owner of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog on a continuous basis following the date of the issuance of the initial certificate of registration, or following the date of any renewal of such certificate.
(g)
The owner of a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog shall notify the animal control officer within twenty-four (24) hours if the dog is on the loose, is unconfined, has attacked a human, has died or has been sold, stolen or donated. If the dog has been sold the owner shall also provided the name, address and telephone number of the new owner.
