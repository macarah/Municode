ARTICLE IV. - SPAY/NEUTER AND REGISTRATION OF DOGS AND CATS

Sec. 5-131. - Findings, purpose, and intent.
(a)
The mayor and city council find that unintended or uncontrolled breeding of dogs and cats within the city leads to the birth of unwanted puppies, kittens, dogs, and cats that become strays, suffer privation and hunger, and that may constitute public hazards, and are impounded and euthanized at great expense to the community and constituting a public nuisance and a public health hazard. Without action aimed at the cause of the problem this problem and its serious consequences, including the cycle of impoundment and euthanasia of unwanted animals will remain unabated and will be compounded with time. It is declared that every feasible means of reducing the number of unwanted dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens be encouraged.
(b)
The mayor and council find that one (1) of the most effective, economical, humane, and ethical solution to the problem of dog and cat overpopulation is to substantially reduce, if not eliminate, unintended breeding and by such reduction or elimination seeks to promote the public health, safety, welfare, and environmental interests of its citizens.
