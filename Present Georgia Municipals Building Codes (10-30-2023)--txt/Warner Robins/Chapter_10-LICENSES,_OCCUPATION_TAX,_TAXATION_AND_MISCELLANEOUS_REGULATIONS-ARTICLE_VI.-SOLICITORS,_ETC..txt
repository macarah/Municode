DIVISION 2. - BEGGING, PANHANDLING, AND CHARITABLE OR POLITICAL SOLICITATION

Sec. 10-126. - Purpose and findings.
The mayor and council do hereby find that:
(1)
It is the intent of mayor and council in enacting this division to recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and convenient travel in public spaces free from intimidating conduct, threats, and harassment that stem from certain types of abusive solicitation, or that may give rise to interference with other's activities if they occur in particular settings and contexts; and
(2)
Mayor and council find that there are numerous forms of solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or aggressive, including vocal requests for a donation; carrying or displaying sign requesting donations; shaking of jingling a cup of change; and ringing a bell in compliance with the city's noise ordinance; and
(3)
However, mayor and council find that there has been an increase in aggressive solicitation in the city, which threatens the security, privacy, and freedom of movement of both residents and visitors; and
(4)
Mayor and council also find that the presence of solicitors in certain specific areas (such as near to or adjacent to automatic teller machines, adjacent to outside seating areas, and in public parking lots) create reasonable concerns by citizens objectively worried about their privacy, freedom of movement, and personal security; and
(5)
Mayor and council further find that certain forms of solicitation impede the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and leads to concerns regarding traffic and public safety, particularly in congested roadways and sidewalks (as defined below to include highly traveled area, lines to enter buildings, commercial districts with narrow sidewalks or on small traffic medians of high-speed or high-volume streets and highways); and
(6)
This division is not intended impermissibly to limit an individual's right to exercise free speech associated with solicitation; rather it aims to impose specific time, place, and manner restrictions on solicitation and associated conduct in certain limited circumstances; namely, limiting aggressive panhandling, panhandling at locations or times deemed particularly threatening and dangerous, and panhandling in places where people are a "captive audience" and there is a wish to avoid or reduce a threat of inescapable confrontations; and
(7)
In promulgating this division, mayor and council seek to impose regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned significant governmental interests.
(Ord. No. 58-17, § 1, 12-14-17)
Sec. 10-127. - Definitions.

(1)
Confronting someone in a way that would cause a reasonable person to fear bodily harm;

(3)
Touching someone without his or her consent;
(4)
Using obscene or abusive language toward someone while attempting to panhandle or solicit him or her;

Areas

"Passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation" includes conduct that falls within said definition in this section, but only such conduct that involves requests for contributions presented in writing without speaking, oral requests for contributions that do not constitute "aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation," or other activities that do not fall within the definition of "aggressive begging, panhandling or solicitation" as defined above.
(Ord. No. 58-17, § 1, 12-14-17)
Sec. 10-128. - Passive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation: when regulated.
Passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation permitted except where expressly prohibited.
The mayor and council find that "passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation," as defined in section 10-127 of this division, should be treated as speech protected under the First Amendment unless other well-ground governmental concerns are implicated. Accordingly, passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation is permitted throughout the jurisdiction except as prohibited in sections 10-130 and 10-131 of this division.
(Ord. No. 58-17, § 1, 12-14-17)
Sec. 10-129. - Aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation prohibited.
(a)
Aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation prohibited. No person shall engage in aggressive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation as defined in section 10-127 of this division at anytime, anywhere in this jurisdiction.
(b)
Violators shall be subject to the maximum penalties provided by law.
(Ord. No. 58-17, § 1, 12-14-17)
Sec. 10-130. - Regulation of panhandling, begging, charitable and political solicitation in areas with specific personal safety and privacy concerns.

(Ord. No. 58-17, § 1, 12-14-17)
Sec. 10-131. - Panhandling, begging, charitable protection of public access and vehicular safety in public streets and highways and on traffic medians and on high volume and high speed highways.
(a)
Areas regulated. Areas regulated by this section include those defined as "areas with heightened public safety concerns" as defined in section 10-127 of this division.
(b)
Findings. The mayor and council find as follows:
(1)
Public safety. Both aggressive and passive begging, panhandling, charitable or political solicitation within streets and highway rights of way, or on small traffic medians (under eight (8) square feet in size), or on traffic medians located on high speed and high-volume traffic corridors as identified in this division, give rise to an increased risk of injury to solicitors on medians, traffic congestion, and traffic accidents that may affect drivers or solicitors.
(2)
Alternative sites. This division provides ample alternative sites for passive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation in areas that do not give rise to enhanced public safety concerns or personal privacy and security concerns.
(3)
Evidence. The city council has undertaken and carefully reviewed studies designed to identify areas in which small traffic medians may put solicitors or motorist at risks, and high speed and high volume traffic corridors that likewise are especially dangerous, in order to assure that those regulations are grounded in appropriate governmental concerns, are narrowly tailored, and allow alternative avenues for communication.
(c)
Prohibitions.
(1)
Generally. Both passive and aggressive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation shall be restricted in "areas with heightened public safety concerns" as defined in section 10-127.
(2)
Exceptions. The mayor and council may identify limited periods each year in which these prohibitions should not be enforced as a result of particularly pressing governmental concerns related to such activities.
a.
Charitable initiatives. Mayor and council may designate up to sixty (60) days a year as days on which these prohibitions shall not apply in order to allow effective solicitation for designated charities, provided that appropriate safety measures are implemented and a permit issued by the police chief.
b.
Election activities. The council may designate up to five (5) days a year as days on which these prohibitions shall not apply in order to allow effective political communications in connection with local, state, and federal elections, provided that appropriate safety measures are implemented.
c.
Documented public safety plan. In the event that the mayor and council designate days as exceptions from this division's requirements, it shall also adopt a documented public safety plan to reduce risks to public safety that might otherwise arise.
d.
Comparable treatment. To the extent that the mayor and council adopt exceptions to the prohibitions set forth in section 10-131(c)(1), relating to charitable initiatives and election activities, such exceptions shall extend to all parties otherwise covered by the provisions of this division relating to begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation.
