(2)
Backflow preventer. A device or means to prevent backflow.
(b)
Minimum required airgap.
(1)
How measured. The minimum required airgap shall be measured vertically from the lowest end of a potable water outlet to the flood rim or line of the fixture or receptacle into which it discharges.
(2)
Size. The minimum required airgap shall be twice the effective opening of a potable water outlet unless the outlet is a distance less than three (3) times the effective opening away from a wall or similar vertical surface, in which cases the minimum required airgap shall be three (3) times the effective opening of the outlet. In no case shall the minimum required airgap be less than shown in the Standard Plumbing Code.
(c)
Approval of devices. Before any device for the prevention of backflow or backsiphonage is installed, it shall have first been certified by a recognized testing laboratory acceptable to the city. Devices installed in a building potable water supply distribution system for protection against backflow shall be maintained in good working condition by the person responsible for the maintenance of the system. The city shall inspect routinely such devices and if found to be defective or inoperative shall require the replacement thereof.
(d)
Installation of devices.
(1)
Vacuum breakers. Vacuum breakers shall be installed with the critical level at least six (6) inches above the flood-level rim of the fixture they serve and on the discharge side of the last control valve to the fixture. No shutoff valve or faucet shall be installed beyond the vacuum breaker. For closed equipment or vessels such as pressure sterilizers the top of the vessel shall be treated as the flood-level rim but a check valve shall be installed on the discharge side of the vacuum breaker.
(2)
Reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. A reduced pressure principle type backflow preventer may be installed subject to full static pressure.
(3)
Devices of all types. Backflow and backsiphonage preventing devices shall be accessibly located preferably in the same room with the fixture they serve. Installation in utility or service spaces, provided they are readily accessible, is permitted. Vacuum breakers and backflow preventers equipped with atmosphere vents or with relief openings shall be so installed and so located as to prevent any vent or any relief opening from being submerged. The preventing devices shall be installed in the position as required by the manufacturer and shall be protected from freezing.
(4)
Thermal expansion control. Where water is heated in a distribution system or a branch of the system that has been provided a vacuum breaker or backflow preventer, a thermal expansion control device shall be installed between the vacuum breaker or backflow preventer and the water heater to limit the static pressure increase due to thermal expansion of the heated water.
(e)
Tanks and vats: below rim supply.
(1)
Where a potable water outlet terminates below the rim of a tank or vat and the tank or vat has an overflow of diameter not less than given in the Standard Plumbing Code, the overflow pipe shall be provided with an airgap as close to the tank as possible.
(2)
The potable water outlet to the tank or vat shall terminate a distance not less than one and one-half (1½) times the height to which water can rise in the tank above the top of the overflow. This level shall be established at the maximum flow rate of the supply to the tank or vat and with all outlets except the airgap overflow outlet closed.
(3)
The distance from the outlet to the high water level shall be measured from the critical point of the potable water supply outlet.
(f)
Connections not subject to backpressure. Where a water connection is not subject to backpressure, a vacuum breaker shall be installed on the discharge side of the last valve on the line serving the fixture or equipment.
(g)
Connections subject to backpressure. Where a potable water connection is made to a line, fixture, tank, vat, pump or other equipment with a hazard of backflow or backsiphonage where the water connection is subject to backpressure, and an airgap cannot be installed, the city shall classify the connection as to the degree of hazard and shall require the installation of backflow preventers required by the degree of hazard as set forth in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Such connections include, but are not limited to, chemical lines, individual water supplies, industrial process water lines, pressure tanks, pumps, steam lines, swimming pools, tanks and vats (bottom inlets), and hose bibbs.
(h)
Barometric loop. Water connections where an actual or potential backsiphonage hazard exists may in lieu of devices specified above be provided with a barometric loop. Barometric loops shall precede the point of connection.
(i)
Low pressure cutoff required on booster pumps. When a booster pump is used on a water pressure booster system and the possibility exists that a positive pressure of 10 psi or less may occur on the suction side of the pump, there shall be installed a low-pressure cutoff on the booster pump to prevent the creation of a vacuum or negative pressure on the suction side of the pump, thus cutting off water to other outlets.
(Code 1977, § 5-2059(d)(9))
Sec. 24-127. - Maintenance requirements.
(a)
Generally. It shall be the responsibility of building and premises owners to maintain all backflow preventers and vacuum breakers within the building or on the premises in good working order and to make no piping or other arrangements for the purpose of bypassing backflow devices.
(b)
Backflow preventer. Periodic testing and inspection schedules shall be established by the city for all backflow preventers and the interval between such testing and inspections and overhauls of each such device shall be established in accordance with the age and condition of the device. Inspection intervals should not exceed one (1) year, and overhaul intervals should not exceed five (5) years.
