ARTICLE XV. - INDOOR SHOOTING RANGES

Sec. 10-351. - General requirements.
(a)
Any gallery range license applicant within the City of Warner Robins must show intent to comply with these code requirements before a building permit will be granted and must demonstrate compliance before occupancy in order to receive a license to operate.
(b)
The range is understood to include the entire space enclosed by the building structure in which the discharge of firearms may take place.
(c)
Compliance will be determined from the building plans provided for obtaining the building permit and from such additional data as may be requested.
(d)
In recognition that special considerations are sometimes involved, the building official may add further requirements as he sees fit.
(e)
The primary type of shooting activity that will be conducted must be established for the record. All other shooting activities that might be conducted must also be established. In case of conflict the most severe activity will govern compliance.
(f)
Except as provided in the sections for special ranges, the range must be of the fixed firing line type in which the shooters remain at one firing line and the targets are brought back and forth to the target line(s) mechanically.
(Ord. No. 40-97, § 1(1), 5-1-97)
Sec. 10-352. - Site selection.
The range must not constitute a nuisance nor a hazard to its contiguous areas. It must be established that:
(1)
The owner controls the contiguous areas;
(2)
The zoning or natural configurations of the contiguous areas prevents them from being occupied by sensitive areas; or
(3)
There will be no more than sixty-five (65) dB of noise emanating from the range into contiguous properties.
(Ord. No. 40-97, § 1(2), 5-1-97; Ord. No. 26-17, § 1, 5-15-17)
Sec. 10-353. - Special considerations.
(a)
The range must be totally enclosed.
(b)
The length must be sufficiently great that the shooters will never be closer than thirty-five (35) feet to the bullet trap (as measured by the longest projection of the bullet trap upon the floor) and sufficient for proper door placement as defined.
(c)
The width must be sufficient to provide three-foot minimum width shooting points for ranges with shooting separators and five-foot minimum width points for those without separators.
(d)
The height at the firing line must be eight-foot minimum from floor to ceiling.
(e)
The following regulations apply to doors:
(1)
There shall be no downrange doors into occupied areas. Downrange shall be understood to be from a point three-foot behind the firing line to the bullet trap. If there is more than one firing line the most distant one from the trap governs.
(2)
There may be downrange doors into unoccupied areas if human egress is not possible.
(3)
There may be downrange doors into normally unoccupied areas that permit human egress providing that they are equipped with electrical safety devices that will provide an alarm to the firing line if the area is occupied and that will provide an alarm in the area if any of the ordinary range functions are commenced (turning on target lights, target systems, etc.).
(f)
Windows are governed by the following requirements:
(1)
There shall be no windows into contiguous areas not controlled by the owner.
(2)
Downrange windows shall be governed as stipulated for down range doors.
(Ord. No. 40-97, § 1(3), 5-1-97)
Sec. 10-354. - Ballistical security; prevention of bullet escape.
(a)
Weapons. It must be established for the record what weapons and ammunition will be used.
(b)
Secure area. If the range is situated so that an escaped bullet cannot fall into or pass through occupiable areas; there is no ballistical security requirement for the structure separating the range from such areas. The range design manuals of the regular military services shall govern the amount of secure area required in such cases.
(c)
Earth separation of three (3) feet or greater is sufficient to eliminate any ballistical security requirement of the structure in that particular direction.
(d)
Critical zones must be penetration proof for the heaviest ammunition that might be used on the range fired point blank into it (at ninety (90) degrees to the surface).
(1)
The horizontal critical zone is any surface that a shooter in any shooting point can hit from forty-five (45) degrees downrange on either side to twenty (20) degrees behind him on either side.
(2)
The vertical critical zone is any surface that a shooter in any shooting point can hit when facing downrange from straight down to straight up.
(Ord. No. 40-97, § 1(4), 5-1-97)
