(2)
Hearing Procedure. All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the mayor/council agenda under a section entitled "Public Hearings". After an initial staff presentation of a specific zoning and/or annexation/zoning request by the mayor/council or their designated staff, citizens' comments will be heard in an orderly fashion. The mayor, mayor pro-tem or designated council member will ask for those citizens speaking against the request first, followed by those in favor of the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. When there are a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke time limitations on speakers. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of the issue equally, and shall be a minimum of ten minutes per side. Citizens may address their comments to the mayor/council as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of council members, city employees, or other citizens will be ruled out of order. After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the mayor/council. The council retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification. The mayor/council will then vote on the application.
When in the opinion of the mayor/council, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence not available to the planning commission at the time of their hearing, or should the mayor/council desire to request further study by the planning commission of a particular aspect of an application request, it is the policy of the mayor/council to table the matter and request the planning commission to restudy the request and affirm or amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the mayor/council prior to making a final decision.
12-2.9.
Standards for Exercise of Zoning Powers. In order to promote the public health, safety, morality and general welfare of the City of Millen against the unrestricted use of property, the recommendation of the planning commission, the following standards, and any other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interest, will be considered by the mayor/council in making any zoning decision:
(1)
The existing land use pattern;
(2)
The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts;

(11)
The extent to which the zoning decision is consistent with the adopted local comprehensive plan as determined by the planning commission.
12-2.10.

Is access into and out of the property adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and to allow access by emergency vehicles?
(3)
Are public facilities such as schools, water, sewer or other public utilities and police and fire protection adequate to serve the proposed special exception use?
(4)
Are refuse, service parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light, glare and other negative impacts?
(5)
Will the hours and manner of operation of the special exception use have no adverse impacts on other properties in the area?
(6)
Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties?
(7)

12-2.11.
Public Hearings Records Standards. The city/clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public hearings. If requested by any party, copies of mechanical or electronic recordings, not written verbatim transcripts, can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's file.
12-3. - Conditional Zoning.
In certain cases where it is deemed that a proposed use is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood but the required zoning would allow uses that are too intensive to mix compatibly with the surrounding area, the mayor and council of the City of Millen may, upon recommendation by the planning staff and/or the planning commission, or on its own initiative, apply certain conditions to a rezoning request in order to allow the proposed use while preserving the purpose and intent of this ordinance. In such cases where conditional zoning is approved, the approval shall be noted as follows: R-1A(c), P-1(c), B-1(c), etc. Any uses would be subject to the conditions applied to the rezoning.
12-4. - Administrative Map Corrections.
In the event that an error is discovered with the official zoning map, the planning director, zoning administrator, or their representative, may correct the error administratively, provided that the error can be proven and documented. A file must be created including all evidence and documentation as well as a map depicting the zoning prior to and after the correction. Such error correction shall not be considered an amendment.
