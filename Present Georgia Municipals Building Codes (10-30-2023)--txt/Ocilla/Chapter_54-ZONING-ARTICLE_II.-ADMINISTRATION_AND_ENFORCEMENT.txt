(3)
The extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent property in the same district.

Sec. 54-166. - General conditions.
These regulations, including the Official Zoning Map and Major Thoroughfare Plan, may be amended by the City Council on their own motion, on an owner's petition, or on recommendation of the Planning Advisory Commission, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the Planning Advisory Commission for review and recommendation. Before enacting an amendment to these regulations, the governing authority shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon as set forth in this section.
(1)
Establishment of Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan is established as official policy of the City. As such, the goals and policies of the Plan, and the resultant future land use Plan, shall serve as the guide under which the incorporated areas of the City are divided into zoning districts. The recommendation of the Plan is hereby established as official policy of the City, and shall receive due consideration all requests as reflected in Section 54-167(h)(5), standards for exercise of zoning power.
(2)
Limited use provision. The City Mayor and Council establish the "limited use" provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the City, a specific land use activity out of a general zoning classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of use in that specific zoning district. For this reason, an applicant may request in a rezoning petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only (for example, N-C LU - Neighborhood Commercial District limited to a funeral home). The requested limited use must be among the uses permitted in the zoning district classification for which the limited use is requested. Alteration or change of an approved limited use shall be treated as any normal zoning amendment.
(3)
Special conditions limitations. An applicant may file site plans, renderings, construction specifications, written development restrictions and other site planning or development conditions which the applicant proposes as binding conditions upon the development and use of the property involved in the application. Should the application be approved with these conditions, any alteration or change of a special condition's limitation shall be treated as any normal zoning amendment.

(h)
Hearing procedures.
(1)
Hearing called.
a.
Before taking action on a proposed amendment, the City Council shall hold a public hearing thereon. At least 15 but not more than 45 days' notice of the time, place, and purpose of said hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. Such notice shall also state the application number and date, and shall contain a summary of the proposed amendment, if a text amendment, and in the case of a map amendment, the location of the property, its area, the name of the owner or their authorized agent, and the present and proposed zoning classification or special exception use for the property affected.
b.
Further, such advertisement shall advise the public pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-3 that any opponent of a proposed rezoning action who has made campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to a local government official of the local government which will consider the application within two years of the date of the application shall be required to file a disclosure with the governing authority of the respective local government showing:
1.

Letters shall include information as to the application, date, time, and place of the public hearing.
(4)
Public hearing opening/closing matters.
a.
All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the City Council agenda under a section entitled "public hearings." The Mayor, or designee, shall officially declare the public hearing open and shall note that the City's written public hearing procedures, the City's standards for exercise of zoning powers, and a copy of Georgia's conflict of interest law are available to the attending public as a handout and are posted for public review.
b.
The Zoning Administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The Mayor shall then call for acknowledgment of a potential conflict of interest by members of the City Council (see Subsection (h)(8) of this section). The Zoning Administrator will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Ocilla/Irwin County Planning Advisory Commission. The Mayor shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide the speaker's name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. When there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally, such minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side. Citizens shall address their comments to the City Council as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of City Council members, City employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The City Council retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification.
c.
After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the City Council. The Mayor shall then declare the public hearing closed and no further public comment will be entertained. The City Council will then render a decision on the application. So that the purpose of this chapter will be served, health, public safety, and general welfare secured, the City Council may approve the application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the district requested, add or delete conditions of the application, deny an application, or defer consideration of an application to acquire additional information. An action by the Council to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application and no further notice is required. In the case of tabling of a matter, no further public comment will be entertained upon further consideration of the matter.
d.
When, in the opinion of the City Council, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Planning Advisory Commission at the time of their review of a zoning matter, or should the City Council desire to request further study by the Planning Advisory Commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the City Council to table the issue and request that the Planning Advisory Commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation which action shall be reported to the City Council prior to making a final decision.
e.
Under no circumstances will public comment be entertained by the City Council following the closing of the public hearing.
(5)
Standards for exercise of zoning powers. In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards, and other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interests shall be considered as they apply to any application brought before the Mayor and Council for a zoning decision:
a.
Is the proposed zoning or use suitable in view of the zoning and development of adjacent and nearby property?
b.
Does the request represent the possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts and will the proposed use adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
c.
Will the proposed use cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including, but not limited to, streets, schools, water, sewer, or other public utilities, including police and fire protection?
d.
Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan or is the proposed use compatible and consistent with the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan?
e.
Will the proposed change adversely influence existing conditions in the neighborhood or the County at large and are there substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently zoned?
f.
Are there potential adverse impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity?
g.
Are the costs required of the public in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and public safety necessities reasonable when considering the proposed changes?
h.
Will the proposed change be detrimental to the value or improvement of development of adjacent or nearby property in accordance with existing requirements and development standards?
i.
Is the proposed change out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or City or does the request reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare and the right to unrestricted use of property?
j.
Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted with the adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public?
(6)
Standards for special exception review. In addition to the standards enumerated in Subsection (h)(4) of this section, the following additional standards shall be considered for special exception requests:
a.
Is the type of street providing access to the use adequate to serve the proposed special exception use?
b.
Is access into and out of the property adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and to allow access by emergency vehicles?
c.
Are public facilities such as schools, water, sewer or other public utilities and police and fire protection adequate to serve the proposed special exception use?
d.
Are refuse, service parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light glare and other negative impacts?
e.
Will the hours and manner of operation of the special exception use have no adverse impacts on other properties in the area?
f.
Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties?
g.
Provided that the Mayor and Council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided that wherever the Mayor and Council shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any term, condition or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said Mayor and Council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
h.
Special exceptions granted by the Mayor and Council shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval, shall not be transferable except upon written approval of the Mayor and Council shall be executed within the granted period or become null and void and subject to procedures for resubmission as hereinabove established.
(7)
Public hearings records standards. The City Clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange, at the requesting party's expense, for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the City Council for its records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning application file.
(8)
Conflict of interest and disclosure rules. Any City Councilmember or Planning Commissioner shall refrain from discussion of or voting upon any matter where the following exist:
a.
Has any direct ownership in any real property to be affected by a rezoning action under consideration by the City government;
b.
Has a ten percent or more direct ownership interest in the total assets or capital stock in any business entity which has any direct ownership in any real property affected by a rezoning action under consideration by the City government; or
c.
Has a spouse, parent, sibling or child with any interest, as described in Subsections (h)(8)a and b of this section, shall disclose the nature and extent of such interest, in writing, to the Mayor and Council as soon as the Councilmember or Commissioner knows of its existence. Such an official, which shall include members of the Mayor and Council or Planning Advisory Commission, also shall be disqualified from voting on the rezoning action and shall not take any other action on behalf of the official or anyone else to influence action on the rezoning action. Any written disclosures made pursuant to this section which result in the inability of the Mayor and Council to obtain a quorum for the purpose of making a final decision when considering a rezoning action, the Mayor and Council shall initiate the special master process set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-5, as amended. Moreover, questions of interpretation as to the application of this statute should be resolved by reference to the Georgia State law governing campaign contribution disclosures, O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 67A (O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq.), as amended.
