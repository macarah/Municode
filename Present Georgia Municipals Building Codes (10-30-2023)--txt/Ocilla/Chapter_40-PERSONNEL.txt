Secs. 40-44—40-74. - Reserved.
ARTICLE III. - DISCIPLINE AND ADVERSE ACTIONS

Sec. 40-75. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish a policy to be used by management in determining appropriate disciplinary action for employee infractions. The policy also establishes administrative procedures to be followed in taking disciplinary action and in processing adverse actions against full-time employees. The schedule of offenses and penalties (Section 40-208) informs employees and supervisors of the range and types of penalties recommended for breaches of discipline committed by employees.
(Code 2003, § 2-7030; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3)
Sec. 40-76. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Adverse action means the procedure which must be followed when dismissing or demoting a full-time employee who has completed the probationary period.
Disciplinary action means and includes written reprimand, suspending an employee from duty without pay, demotion and dismissal.
Non-duty status with pay means placing an employee in a non-work status away from the job while continuing the employee's regular pay. This is only used while investigating an employee to determine if dismissal action is warranted and the employee's presence on the job is believed to constitute a hazard to the employee or others. It shall be done by letter giving the reason and contain instructions concerning contacts with this government during this period. It is not a disciplinary action.
(Code 2003, § 2-7031; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3)
Sec. 40-77. - Coverage.
The use of the disciplinary and adverse action procedures and schedule of penalties and offenses prescribed herein applies to all full-time employees who have completed their probationary period. Probationary full-time, part-time, temporary and excepted employees are not covered by this policy. Unless protected by some other policy, regulation or law, they may be separated at any time without advance notice or appeal.
(Code 2003, § 2-7032; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3, § 1)
Sec. 40-78. - Use of the schedule.
The schedule is intended to assist supervisors in determining how to discipline employees and at the same time correct their work habits or behavior in such a way that they can be retained as useful workers. Dismissal action should be taken on the first offense only for serious misconduct or when it becomes apparent that several lesser penalties have failed to rehabilitate a chronic offender.
(Code 2003, § 2-7033; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3, § 2)
Sec. 40-79. - Selection of the penalty.
(a)
The schedule is flexible since it recognizes that the selection of a penalty in any specific case will depend on the type of offense and how serious it is. It must also take into account the effect it will have on this government, other employees, and the public. Consideration must be given the employee's authority, seniority, past employment history, and the circumstances which led to the infraction. In many cases, for the first minor offense, the supervisor may decide to only caution and counsel the employee.
(b)
For most offenses, the schedule provides several levels of severity to choose from with respect to a penalty. This gives the responsible supervisor several alternative actions for each successive infraction. The least harsh penalty which the supervisor believes will have the desired corrective effect on the employee will normally be imposed. A penalty within the range shown for that number of offenses on the chart (Section 40-208) should be used. Example: first offense, second offense, third offense. It is not intended that for a series of minor offenses the penalty for the third offense must always be dismissal. Again, the primary consideration is judging whether or not the employee can be rehabilitated and what effect on the total organization the action will have.
(Code 2003, § 2-7034; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3, § 3)
Sec. 40-80. - Penalties.
The following penalties may be imposed:
(1)
Written reprimand is the lightest penalty. A letter signed by the department head or elected official will be given to the employee advising this is a written reprimand and what offense it is being given for. It will also state whether it is the first, second, third or fourth penalty imposed. The letter should warn that further infractions may lead to suspension or dismissal. A copy of the letter will be filed in the employee's personnel folder.
(2)
Suspension is a severe penalty. The employee may be suspended from work without pay for from one day, not to exceed ten days, depending on the seriousness of the offense. This must be done by letter in advance of the first day of suspension giving the reason and what day the employee is to report back to work. The letter will be signed by the department head and warn that further infractions may lead to dismissal. A copy will be filed in the employee's personnel folder.
(3)
Demotion is not normally used as a disciplinary action. It is more appropriate in those cases where the employee fails to perform satisfactorily because of inability rather than indolence. Providing the employee is otherwise satisfactory, and there is another position at a lower level that it is believed the employee can perform, the demotion action serves as a useful purpose. The employee will be notified in writing at least ten days in advance of the date of demotion. The letter will be signed by the EEO Officer. It will contain the specific reasons for the action, the date of the demotion, and inform the employee of the employee's right to appeal the action. (See Article IV of this Chapter, Adverse Action Appeals.) A copy will be filed in the employee's personnel folder.
(4)
Dismissal is the final penalty. The employee will be notified in writing at least ten workdays in advance of the date of separation. The letter should be delivered or mailed in advance of the beginning of the ten workdays period. The letter will be signed by the EEO Officer and will include in detail the specific reason for the dismissal, the date of separation, and inform the employee of any appeal rights. If should also inform the employee that if the employee is going to appeal, the date by which the appeal must be received. (See Article IV of this Chapter, Adverse Action Appeals.) A copy of the letter will be filed in the employee's personnel folder.
(Code 2003, § 2-7035; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3, § 4)
Sec. 40-81. - Timeliness of actions.
(a)
Normally, disciplinary action shall be initiated within one week after an offense has been committed or discovered. For extremely serious offenses, action may be taken as soon as management becomes aware of the infraction, regardless of the period of time which has elapsed since the offense occurred.
(b)
In assessing a penalty for a current offense which has been preceded by several other offenses for which a disciplinary penalty has been given, only those disciplinary actions taken within the three-year period just prior to the date of the current infraction may be used to justify a more severe penalty.
(Code 2003, § 2-7036; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3, § 5)
Sec. 40-82. - Disciplinary action authority.
(a)
Department heads are delegated authority to impose the following disciplinary penalties on employees under their supervision: Written reprimand and suspension without pay.
(b)
Authority to place an employee in a nonduty status with pay, and to take adverse actions involving demotion or dismissal charges against an employee rests with the EEO Officer. Department heads may recommend such action.
(c)
The Personnel Director, as specified in the City Natural Gas Department Anti-Drug Program's Policies and Procedures, shall have the authority and is hereby given the authority to discharge any employee of the gas department instanter upon such employee testing positive to drugs as defined in the policies and procedures and for any violation of the Natural Gas Department's Anti-Drug Policies and Procedures as adopted by the City.
(Code 2003, § 2-7037; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3, § 6; Ord. of 2-5-1991)
Sec. 40-83. - Schedule of offenses and penalties generally.
A schedule of offenses and penalties is set forth in Section 40-208. It is impossible to include every type of disciplinary problem which may arise, or describe every situation explicitly. For those not found in Section 40-208, supervisors should compare the unlisted offense with those listed and select the one most similar or of comparable seriousness. Apply the penalty to the unlisted offense in a like manner.
(Code 2003, § 2-7038; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 3, § 7)
Sec. 40-84. - Preparing charges.
(a)
Letters to employees proposing demotion or dismissal will contain the date of the proposed action and the reason for the action. These reasons will be specific and in detail and contain all facts being relied on to support the action. Nothing concerning prior disciplinary actions will be included in this paragraph of the letter.
(b)
In the next paragraph make reference to prior disciplinary actions, if any, taken against the employee, only if required by the schedule of offenses and penalties to justify the severity of the penalty proposed. Use only those occurring within the three years immediately prior to the date the current offense occurred, and for which a penalty was imposed. Briefly state the offense, the penalty imposed and date of each charge used.
(c)
In this paragraph, advise that if the employee desires to appeal the action, the date by which the appeal must be received (no later than the third workday following receipt of this letter). Include a statement that the appeal must be in writing and be received by the EEO Officer no later than the third workday following receipt of this letter, and that if a timely appeal is not received, no further notice of the dismissal will be given.
(d)
If at all possible, the letter should be delivered to the employee in person. When this is not possible, send by certified mail to the last known address and allow one extra day for receiving the appeal.
(e)
The letter must be dated, signed, and delivered in advance of the ten-day required notice period.

An employee may appeal a demotion or dismissal action. The appeal must be in writing and be received in the EEO Officer's office no later than the close of business (5:00 p.m.) on the third workday following receipt of the letter of notification; otherwise, it will not be accepted. The day the letter of notification is given the employee is not included in this three-day period. Upon receiving an appeal, the employee will be given a copy of this adverse action appeals procedures and advised to comply with it.
(b)
Employees have the right to be accompanied, advised and represented by a person of their own choosing in presenting their appeal under this procedure.
(c)
Management will normally be represented by the department head over the employee. However, the EEO Officer may designate another person to be management's representative.

ARTICLE VI. - EMPLOYEE CONDUCT

Sec. 40-169. - Purpose.
Employees are expected to conduct themselves, both on and off the job, in a manner which will reflect favorably upon themselves and this government.

(Code 2003, § 2-7060; Mo. of 12-6-1980, pt. 6)

Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.

Expose corruption wherever discovered.
(10)
Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

Sec. 40-177. - Drug-free policy.
(a)
The United States Congress has enacted the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988. The purpose of this law is to ensure that work done under federal contracts or federal grants is performed in a drug-free work environment. In addition to prohibiting employees from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illegal drugs in the workplace, this department prohibits its employees from engaging in such illegal activity at all times and at all places. Such activity, even during nonworking hours, clearly affects an employee's ability to perform the employee's public duties. Therefore, this City adopts the following as its drug-free policy:
(1)
No employee of this City may illegally engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance at any time or place, including while at the employee's workplace. Such unlawful activity will be considered a sufficient ground for a serious adverse personnel action, including dismissal from employment.
(2)
If an employee is arrested for or convicted (including a plea of nolo contendere) of violating any criminal drug statute of any jurisdiction, regardless of whether the alleged violation occurred at the workplace or elsewhere, the employee must notify the Mayor of this City in writing of each arrest or conviction as soon as possible but in no event more than five calendar days after the arrest or conviction.
(3)
Failure to comply with any part of this policy will result in serious adverse personnel action, including possible dismissal from employment.
(b)
Any questions concerning this policy should be directed to the employee's chief, superintendent, or supervisor, as the case may be.
