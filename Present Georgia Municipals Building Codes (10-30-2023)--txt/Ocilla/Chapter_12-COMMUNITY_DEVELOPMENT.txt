ARTICLE III. - BLIGHTED PROPERTY

Sec. 12-78. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "Ocilla Blighted Property Ordinance."
( Ord. of 10-2-2018 , § 2)
Sec. 12-79. - Violations; enforcement penalties.
(a)
The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the State and local government by increasing the need for government services, including, but not limited to, social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
(b)
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the City, the City Council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations in the Urban Redevelopment Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-61-1 et seq.), has designated those areas of the City where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
(c)
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Art. IX, Sec. II, ¶ VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State.

An inspection must be performed on the parcel of property. In order for an inspection to be performed:
a.
A request may be made by the public officer or by at least five residents of the City for inspection of a parcel of property, said inspection to be based on the criteria as delineated in ordinance; or
b.
The public officer may cause a survey of existing housing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or finalized within the previous five years, to locate or identify any parcels which may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel of property meets the criteria set out in this article for designation as being maintained in a blighted condition.

Written request for hearing shall be filed with the public officer and shall be date stamped upon receipt. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the public officer shall notify the Municipal Court and the Building Inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspection report.
(c)
Within 30 days of the receipt of a request for hearing, the Municipal Court Clerk shall set a date, time and location for the hearing and shall give at least ten business days' notice to the person requesting the hearing, the public officer and the Building Inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspection report. Notice of scheduled hearings shall be published as a legal advertisement in the Ocilla Star, or other designated legal organ in the County, at least five days prior to the hearing. Hearings may be continued by the Municipal Court Judge upon request of any party, for good cause.
(d)
At the hearing, the public officer shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this article. The Municipal Court Judge shall cause a record of the evidence submitted at the hearing to be maintained. Upon hearing from the public officer and/or their witnesses and the person requesting the hearing and/or their witnesses, the Judge of Municipal Court shall make a determination either affirming or reversing the determination of the public officer. The determination shall be in writing and copies thereof shall be served on the parties by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. The determination by the Court shall be deemed final. A copy of such determination shall also be served upon the Tax Commissioner of the County, who shall include the increased tax on the next regular tax bill rendered on behalf of the City.

Upon finding required work to be satisfactorily performed, the public officer shall issue a written determination that the real property is no longer maintained in a blighted condition. Copies of this determination shall be served upon the person chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes, and upon the Tax Commissioner of the County.
(c)
All plans for remedial action or redevelopment shall be in writing, signed by the person chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes on the real property and the Mayor, and contain the following:

Sec. 12-84. - Decrease of tax rate.
(a)
Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, as provided in Section 12-82, identification of blighted property, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of City ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.5 to the City millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in City ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years.
