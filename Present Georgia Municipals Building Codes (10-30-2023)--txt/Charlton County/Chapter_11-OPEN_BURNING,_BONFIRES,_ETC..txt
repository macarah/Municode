h.

(b)
Open burning, with permit issued by Georgia Forestry Commission only, is allowed for the purpose of land clearing, construction right-of-way maintenance, and agriculture provided the following conditions are met:

(c)
Variances:
(1)
Any person desiring a variance from these regulations for open burning or desiring one of the exceptions described in subsection l above shall make an application therefore to the fire chief or fire marshal.
(2)
The fire chief or fire marshal may grant specific or general classes of exceptions to or variances of the particular requirements of any rule, regulation or general order upon such conditions as he may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, if, upon petition, he finds that strict compliance with such rule, regulation, or general order is inappropriate for one (1) of the following reasons:
a.
Because of conditions beyond the control of the petitioner, i.e., those conditions which, though ordinary diligence is employed, remain unforeseeable or unpredictable, e.g., strikes, walkouts, or other industrial disturbances, acts of God, civil disturbances, embargoes, or other causes of like character; provided, however, that this shall not include conditions solely because they are dependent upon contingencies, i.e., including but not limited to, the variable cost or availability of maintenance, equipment, labor, raw materials, fuel or energy; or
b.
Because of special circumstances which would render strict compliance unreasonable, unduly burdensome, or impracticable due to special physical conditions or causes; or
c.
Because strict compliance would result in substantial curtailment or closing of the business operation; or
d.
Because no alternative method of handling is available.
(d)
General restrictions and appeals:
(1)
If the fire chief or fire marshal determines that certain open burning, otherwise permitted, imposes a threat to the public health, safety and general welfare, he shall have the authority to impose additional safety precautions or restrict the burning, including the issuance of a complete ban on the open burning in the particular location.
(2)
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the fire chief or fire marshal may appeal in writing to the board of commissioners, via the county administrator, within ten days from the date of such decision. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be deemed final.
(3)
Except for a reasonable period to get a fire started, no smoke of a shade darker than a No. 2 of the Ringlemann chart, or equivalent opacity, shall be emitted by a source of open burning listed in subsections (a) through (c) above.
(4)
During a fire risk emergency or air pollution emergency declared by the board of commissioners or other proper county or state authorities, no open burning of any kind shall be permitted unless open burning is required in the performance of an official duty or any public office, or a fire is necessary to thwart or prevent a hazard which cannot be properly managed by any other means or is necessary for the protection of public health.
(3)
Penalties: Violations of this section shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of sections 1-10 through 1-14 of Chapter 1, Subpart A, Part II of the Code of Ordinances.
