Sec. 22-59. - Methods of sorting, storing or handling of yard trimmings.
The productivity of the soils requires that nature's way of recycling vegetative matter be respected and such matter should be returned to the soil rather than being wastes by being buried in landfills.

(1)
Naturalized, low-maintenance landscaping requiring little or no cutting;
(2)
Grass cycling by mowing it high and letting it lie;
(3)
Stacking branches into brush piles for use as wildlife habitats and for gradual decomposition into the soil;
(4)
Composting on the site where the material was grown, followed by incorporation of the finished compost into the soil at that site;
(5)
Chipping woody material on the site where such material was generated;
(6)
Collecting yard trimmings and transporting them to another site to be chipped or composted for later use; and
(7)
Chipping woody material for later use as fiber fuel.
