Sec. 2-111. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
Those who are elected to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire, or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. The public entrusts its power and resources to its servants to use only in the public interest. Public trust requires public servants to fulfill their public duties faithfully and honestly, and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair.
(b)
It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government. Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.

(9)
To establish penalties, as appropriate, for public servants who violate the public trust; and
