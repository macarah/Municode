The city will not issue a building permit for such lots.
(e)
Special historic buildings. The provisions of the building codes relating to the construction, alteration, repair, enlargement, restoration, relocation or moving of buildings or structures shall not be mandatory for existing buildings or structures identified and classified by the state, county or city as historic buildings when such buildings or structures are judged by the city to be safe and in the public interest of health, safety and welfare regarding any proposed construction, alteration, repair, enlargement, restoration, relocation, or moving of buildings within fire districts.
(f)
Requirements for safe work. All work performed relating to the construction, alteration, repair, enlargement, restoration, relocation or moving of buildings or structures, including work on the building or structure itself, or the building's or structure's electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, shall be done in a safe manner, in compliance with the requirements of the standard building codes, and the International Property Maintenance Code, which is adopted by the city. Work not done in compliance with these requirements, whether or not it requires a permit, may be subject to citation, stop-work order, or other civil remedy by the city.
(g)
Permit required. Any owner, authorized agent, or contractor who desires to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, or change the occupancy of a building or a structure, or to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, convert or replace any electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system, the installation of which is regulated by the standard building codes, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make application to the city and obtain the required permit for the work, except as exempted below. Any time a new nonresidential business is beginning operation in an existing structure, or any time a new tenant is to occupy an existing nonresidential structure, such person or entity shall be required to notify the city and obtain an inspection prior to obtaining a business license and/or beginning tenancy (such requirements shall not apply to residential tenants such as apartment renters). It shall be unlawful to commence construction of a building or structure requiring a permit without first obtaining a permit, as required herein. It shall be unlawful to commence any land disturbance activity for the construction of any building, to commence construction of any building, to commence the moving or alteration of any building, or to commence the development of land for a use not requiring a building, until all necessary permits for such work have been issued.

The manufactured home shall still be required to be inspected after installation.
(4)
Fees. A permit and inspection fee shall be charged to the application to cover the cost to the city to process the permit application and inspect the pre-owned manufactured home once installed. Such fee shall cover the initial inspection and one follow-up inspection. The applicant shall be charged a fee for each additional follow-up inspection that may be necessary.
(5)
Certificate of completion. A certificate of completion shall be issued to the applicant at such time that the building official certifies that the requirements of this article have been met.

Installation of manufactured homes. Construction of manufactured homes is regulated by federal law and not this chapter; however, installation of manufactured homes must meet manufacturers' specifications and the requirements of this subsection (l) and the zoning ordinance before permanent utilities may be installed. An installation permit must be obtained prior to installation and an inspection must occur of the installation, including utility connections and underpinning, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(1)
Installation requirements. Manufactured homes must be installed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 8-2-160 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
(2)
Utility connections. Utility connections prior to the final inspection of the installation will be considered temporary and will be approved only when arrangements for complete installations have been made.
(3)
Entry landing. All manufactured home installations shall provide an adequate means of entry (including steps and a landing at each doorway).
(4)
Sewage management. A septic permit or a sewer tap must be secured and provided to building inspectors before an installation permit for a manufactured home will be permitted.

a.
The underpinning shall consist of one of the following: masonry, vinyl siding/panels or aluminum siding/panels, or such other material as may be approved by the building official prior to installation. The following types of materials are not permitted to be used, including, but not limited to, tin, wood (unless of a naturally decay-resistant type such as cedar), plastic sheeting or gypsum board (black board).
b.
The underpinning must be adequately secured to the manufactured home and where necessary for stability, secured to the ground. Two access doors are required to be installed in a manner which will provide adequate access for inspections and maintenance. Provisions must be made for adequate ventilation for the crawl space underneath the manufactured home.
(m)
Installation of industrialized homes. Construction of industrialized homes is regulated by the state department of community affairs and not this article. However, installation of homes must meet manufacturers' specifications and the specifications of the zoning ordinance before permanent utilities may be installed. An installation permit must be obtained prior to installation and an inspection must occur of the installation, including utility connections and foundation, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(1)
Installation requirements. Industrialized homes must be installed in accordance with O.C.G.A. title 8, ch. 2, art. 2, pt. 1 (O.C.G.A. § 8-2-110 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(2)
Utility connections. Utility connections prior to the final inspection of the installation will be considered temporary and will be approved only when arrangements for complete installations have been made.
(3)
Entry landing. All industrialized home installations shall provide an adequate means of entry (including steps and a landing at each doorway).
(4)
Sewage management. A septic permit or a sewer tap must be secured and provided to building inspections before an installation permit for an industrialized home will be permitted.
(5)
Foundations. The dwelling must be placed on a foundation, and a curtain wall, un-pierced except for required ventilation and access, must be installed so that it encloses the area located under the home to ground level. Such a wall shall have a minimum thickness of four inches and shall be constructed of masonry or similar material as approved by the building official.
(n)
Swimming pools. Any swimming pool shall be enclosed with a fence that is in compliance with the standard building code (International Residential Code), including, but not limited to, appendix G. Public swimming pools must also comply with applicable regulations of the county board of health.
(o)
Signs. Signs shall be constructed as permitted in Zoning Ordinance, Article VIII.
(p)
Moved houses. A house moved to another location in the city (or a house moved into the city from another county) must have the necessary improvements made so as to be in compliance with the standard building codes that are in effect for new construction at the time the home is placed in its new location. Where any particular improvements that would be required to the moved house are technically unfeasible or impractical, or would be cost prohibitive (especially in relation to the benefit received or the purpose, goal, or intent of the standard or regulation at issue), a written request may be made to the city requesting an exemption from the particular standard or requirement, and detailing why the request for exemption is being submitted. The city may grant exemption, if reasonable, or may deny the exemption. The exemption granted should not impair the public safety purposes of the standard building codes and should be the minimum necessary.
(q)
Prohibited exterior materials; temporary repair exception. It shall be unlawful to use roof or wall covering material that has not been approved by the applicable building code as exterior covering material, except in the event a building is damaged by natural or manmade disaster, or suffers a roof leak, other leak, or other damage. In such cases, temporary materials may be applied to a building to provide a temporary repair for no more than 60 days from the date of the damage. One 60-day extension can be requested from the city, for cause, if the structure is not able to be properly repaired with approved exterior covering material within 60 days. Examples of materials that are not approved as exterior covering materials include, but are not limited to, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, and OSB. This restriction shall not apply to buildings that would not require a building permit to construct, such as outbuildings and storage buildings.
(r)
Partially-built structures. The city finds that partially-built and subsequently abandoned homes and other buildings and structures are occurring more frequently and are an aesthetic harm to the community; they also reduce property values of adjacent and nearby property; they create a public safety hazard in that they can be dangerous; and they invite illicit activity. The city finds such structures to be a nuisance. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for a property owner to leave a residential, commercial or industrial structure in a partially-built status for more than six months with no substantial progress occurring on the construction. Partially-built means foundations that are poured or erected; basements that have been dug and partially completed; and structures that have been framed or dried-in (siding, roofing, windows and doors in place) but not completed. For homes that have been damaged by fire or disaster after completion, see the City of Emerson Zoning Ordinance. It shall be permissible to finish the exterior of a commercial shopping center or other commercial or industrial building without building-out the inside. It shall also be a violation for a partially completed building or structure to remain unfinished without a certificate of occupancy more than 30 days after the expiration of its building permit (building permits expire one year from issuance unless extended). The city shall be authorized to issue citations to the property owner or builder, and shall be authorized to seek abatement of the nuisance in the municipal court or superior court.
(s)
Retaining walls.
(1)
A building permit shall be required for any retaining wall that exceeds three feet in exposed wall height, or exceeds two feet in exposed wall height and supports a surcharge. A building permit application shall require a site plan showing the location, extent, and height of the retaining wall in relation to any building structure, pool, property lines, and public utility easements. It shall also require complete construction details of the retaining wall, and structural calculations for the wall, both stamped and signed by a professional engineer.
(2)
Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Exposed wall height means the vertical distance measure from the finish grade at the bottom of the wall (lower soil grade) to the finish grade at the top of the wall (upper soil grade). This height does not include the wall and depth of footing below grade.
Retaining wall means a wall designed to resist lateral earth and/or fluid pressures, including any surcharge, in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
Surcharge means a vertical load imposed on the retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of the retained soil. Examples of surcharges include sloping retained soil, structure footings supported by the retained soil, adjacent vehicle loads supported by the retained soil, and solid fences that are attached or directly adjacent to a retaining wall when wind pressures act on the fence.
(t)
Commercial car washes. Effective January 1, 2011, any commercial conveyor car wash (as defined in this subsection) that is permitted and constructed, shall install a recycled water system which captures and reuses water previously used in wash or rinse cycles. A minimum of 50 percent of the water utilized shall be recycled. The term "commercial conveyor car wash" means a commercial car wash where the car moves on a conveyor belt during the wash (regardless of whether the driver remains in the vehicle or not).

(e)
If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, or otherwise constitutes a public nuisance, then the court shall state, in writing, its findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order:
(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of said dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure, in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations, cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
a.
For purposes of this provision, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.
b.
In any action brought to enforce the provisions of this article, the city shall be entitled to its attorney's fees and other litigation costs, such to be a lien against the property, unless the court determines that the failure to comply with this article was substantially justified based on the record as a whole.
(f)
If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the zoning administrator may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed, or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement, by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The zoning administrator shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of any building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building/property is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes, or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(g)
If the zoning administrator has the structure demolished, reasonable efforts shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any sale of such salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The zoning administrator and the governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(h)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, attorney's fees and expenses awarded by the court, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(i)
The lien provided for in subsection (h) of this section, shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 103-63(c). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes, to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.
(1)
Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred, the zoning administrator shall transmit to the tax commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the tax commissioner or other official who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall collect and enforce liens imposed pursuant to this article in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 48-5-359.1 and 41-2-9(b). The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority whose lien is being collected.
(2)
Enforcement of liens may be initiated at any time following receipt by the tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article.
(3)
The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority or tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
(j)
The governing authority may waive and release such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(k)
Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, but rather commences in municipal court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
(l)
In addition to the procedures and remedies outlined above, the zoning administrator may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, and life safety codes adopted by the city, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem.
(m)
Nothing shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
