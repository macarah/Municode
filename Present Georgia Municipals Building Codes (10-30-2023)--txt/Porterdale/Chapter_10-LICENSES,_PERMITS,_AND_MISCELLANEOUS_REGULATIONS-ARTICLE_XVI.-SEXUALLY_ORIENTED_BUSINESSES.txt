ARTICLE XVI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-700. - Purpose, findings, intent, and incorporation of recitals.
(a)
Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote and protect the public health, safety, good order, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, to establish reasonable and uniform regulations of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing an unreasonable limitation or unreasonable restriction on the content of any lawful communicative materials including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to unreasonably restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene or otherwise illegal material.
(b)
Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council, as contained in the report to the mayor and city council of the city on regulation of sexually oriented businesses, prepared by the city attorney and on file with the office of the city clerk, and other matters and documents relating to all of the above, which report and materials hereby are incorporated by this reference, the city council finds:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises.
(2)
Sexually oriented businesses can lead to significant negative secondary effects, such as increased crime rates and increased ambient crime risk in the surrounding areas.
(3)
The negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses are present in urban environments, suburban environments, and in rural areas.
(4)
The negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses can be associated with all business models, including those that provide adult entertainment only for off-site consumption.
(5)
The negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated by allowing such businesses to cluster together.
(6)
The negative secondary effects associated with the presence of sexually oriented businesses in small towns are likely to be magnified beyond that which would be expected in larger cities because of the more compact nature of downtowns and their relationship to surrounding neighborhoods.
(7)
Certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses defined in this article engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments.
(8)
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers.
(9)
Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions.
(10)
Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult video facilities, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments.
(11)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and, in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
(12)
Studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films.
(13)
The findings noted in paragraphs (1)—(12), and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns.
(14)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(15)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(16)
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters and adult video facilities.
(17)
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments.
(18)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
(19)
The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article.
(20)
Commercial establishments exist in nearby cities and counties in Georgia where sexually oriented material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.
(21)
Commercial establishments exist in nearby cities or counties in Georgia where sexually oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude, or topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers.
(22)
Commercial sexually oriented businesses exist in nearby cities or counties in Georgia where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact, and other services providing sexual encounters. The workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in Georgia engage in physical contact or touching with customers including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness.
(23)
The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order, health, safety, economy, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the city.
(24)
When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses are present in establishments and businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property.
(25)
When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and businesses to move to other locations.
(26)
The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers, and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment.
(27)
Physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both, and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases.
(28)
In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at sexually oriented businesses.
(29)
The potential dangers to the good order, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate.
(30)
Requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contacts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments.
(31)
Prohibiting sexually oriented businesses from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse effects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses.
(32)
Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers, and pose a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression.
(33)
Sexually oriented businesses involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and, therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community.
(34)
The general welfare, health, good order, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.
(c)
Intent. It is the intent of this article to protect and preserve the good order, health, peace, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Porterdale. This article regulates conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq.
(d)
Authority. This article is enacted under the constitutionally derived home rule power of the city in the interest of the good order, health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city.
(e)
Recitals. It is the city council's further intention to accomplish those intents and purposes expressed by the city council in the recitals of the ordinance from which this section derives, each of which are incorporated by reference into this section.
(f)
Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit constitutionally protected expression or speech. This article is intended to reasonably regulate sexually oriented businesses which engage in commercial activities involving acts or services of a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or services involving matters which are sexual in nature.

DIVISION 3. - BUSINESS LICENSE

Sec. 10-706. - Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent deleterious effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this article to in any way condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material or material harmful to minors. Rather, it is the purpose of the article to regulate sexually oriented business establishments to prevent increases in criminal activity and undesirable community conditions. It is recognized that such regulation cannot approach prohibition, or a protected form of expression would vanish. Therefore, this article represents an attempt to balance the competing interests of reduced criminal activity and neighborhood protection versus the rights of sexually oriented business establishments and patrons.
