Sec. 107-59. - Historic district designation.
(1)
Findings and purpose.
(a)
The mayor and city council have found and determined that the historical, cultural and aesthetic heritage of the city are among its most valued and important assets and that the preservation of this heritage is essential to the promotion of the health, prosperity and general welfare of the people.
(b)
The areas of the City of Porterdale being designated as historic districts are among the best surviving examples of mill communities in Georgia, including three distinct mill complexes, an intact mill village, and numerous community landmark buildings, significant under themes of industry, community planning and development, and architecture.
(c)
In accordance with the ordinance to establish a historic preservation commission in the city, to provide for the designation of historic properties of historic districts, to provide for issuance of certificates of appropriateness, to provide for an appeals procedure, to repeal conflicting ordinances, and for other purposes as set forth in chapter 107 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Porterdale, the mayor and council hereby declare it to be the purpose and intent of this section to designate historic districts in geographically definable areas containing buildings, structures, sites, objects, landscape features and works of art or a combination thereof, which have special historic and aesthetic value or interest in representing one or more eras in the history of the City of Porterdale, Newton County, Georgia.
(d)
There are three districts being established hereby, designated as follows:
1.
The Rose Hill Historic District. This district is situated on either side of North Broad Street/State Route 81 at the easternmost edge of the National Register and Porterdale municipal boundaries. Out of 33 properties, there are 18 remaining contributing historic resources within this small district. Most of the contributing resources were built in 1912. A reflection of the Jim Crow era, the Rose Hill neighborhood specifically was built for the African-American mill workforce. The district is significant not only for its examples of architecture, but also as an example of early 20th century community planning as it affected African-Americans. The district is significant as an example of social history and African-American ethnic heritage. The saddlebag houses were built smaller and situated nearer to one another than in other areas of the city, and were located furthest from the mills.
2.
The Residential Historic District. This is the largest of the local historic districts in Porterdale, encompassing most of the properties within the National Register district boundaries that are not identified in the Rose Hill or Downtown Commercial Districts. Out of 508 properties, there are 475 contributing historic resources within this district. Seven houses originally were located on property south of the Yellow River that was first settled as Cedar Shoals, but were later moved to the north side of the river. The majority of the mill workers' housing units located in the Residential Historic District were constructed during the first two decades of the 20th century. These houses consist predominantly of four- and six-room wood framed houses and four-room gabled-ell houses. Six-room duplexes were constructed on empty lots within the district between 1920 and the early 1940's, many of which were later divided into apartments. This district is significant for its examples of late 19th and early 20th Century Revival architecture (Colonial, Late Gothic, Tudor), and early 20th Century American Movement. In addition, the district is significant as an example of community planning and development, as the residential areas were planned and developed as integral components of mill operations. The Residential Historic District is described in two sections: The first section consists of the historic residential areas of the city lying east of the Yellow River, while the second section consists of the historic residential areas lying west of the Yellow River.
3.
The Downtown Commercial Historic District. This district encompasses 28 commercial properties, most of which are situated along Main Street/State Route 81 from the Yellow River to the west and the former Welaunee Inn on the easternmost boundary. Included in this district is the still operational Osprey Mill complex, nestled within the residential district north of Main Street. Within this district, there are 24 remaining contributing historic resources, the oldest of which was built in the 1890's. The three mill complexes encompassed within the Downtown Commercial District are significant as they provide an understanding of all aspects of textile mill operations in Georgia, which operations were a major component of the state's economy for a century, beginning in the middle of the 19th century. Included within the Downtown Commercial District are the railroad depot, office buildings contracted for use of mill executives, a commissary building serving the community, and the Porter Memorial Gymnasium (although damaged by fire, recently partially reconstructed and re-purposed as an events venue). The Downtown Commercial Historic District is described in two sections: The first section consists of the historic mill complex lying north of Main Street/State Route 81, and surrounded by the Residential Historic District; the second section consists of the historic mill complexes and buildings situated along Main Street/State Route 81.
(2)
Districts created. There hereby are created and designated in and for the City of Porterdale three historic districts, to be known as the Rose Hill Historic District, the Residential Historic District, and the Downtown Commercial Historic District. Individual district boundaries necessarily will follow a mixture of street rights-of-way and legal property boundaries, as denoted on the Porterdale Commercial, Residential and Rose Hill Local Historic Districts Map prepared by the Northeast Georgia Regional Commission, effective date January 7, 2016, which map is attached hereto as Attachment A and made a part hereof by this reference, and which district boundaries are described as follows:
