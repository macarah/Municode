(2)
Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the chapter will in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of zoning appeals that the following conditions exist:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
b.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located.
c.
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located.
d.
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
e.
The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant.
f.
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.
g.
The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures, which are not permitted by right in the district involved.
(d)

(1)
In exercising its powers, the board of appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination, and to that end shall have all of the powers of the city council or building inspector and may issue or direct the issuance of a building permit.

(Code 2003, § 39-106(12); Ord. of 7-9-2007(2))
Sec. 119-42. - Building permits.
(a)
Generally. It shall be unlawful for any building to be located, erected, moved, or added to, or structurally altered, without obtaining a building permit issued by the building inspector. No building permit shall be issued except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
(b)
Application for permits.
(1)
An application shall be accompanied by two copies of a dimensional sketch or a to-schedule plan, signed by the owner, or his authorized agent, to include, as a minimum, the following:
a.
Lot dimensions with property line monuments located thereon;
b.
Shape, size, height, and location of the buildings proposed to be erected, demolished, altered, or moved, and of any buildings already on the lot, yard dimensions and use of structures, including the number of dwelling units within each structure where appropriate;
c.
Easements (private and public);
d.
Water courses;
e.
Fences;
f.
Street names and street right-of-way lines; and
g.
Such other information regarding abutting property as directly affects the application.
(2)
Each permit shall be conspicuously posted and displayed on the premises described in the permit during the period of construction or reconstruction.
a.
If the proposed excavation, filling, construction, or movement set forth in said sketch or plan are in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, and other appropriate codes and ordinances then in effect, the building inspector shall sign and return one copy of the sketch plan to the applicant and shall issue a building permit. The building inspector shall retain one copy of the building permit and one copy of the sketch or plan for his records.
b.
If the sketch or plan submitted describes work which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter, the building inspector shall not issue a building permit but shall return one copy of the sketch of plan to the applicant along with a signed refusal and shall cite the portions of these ordinances with which the submitted sketch plan does not comply. The building inspector shall retain one copy of the sketch plan and two copies of the refusal.
c.
Any building permit shall automatically expire six months from the date of issuance if the person, firm, or corporation to which the certificate or permit was issued has not clearly demonstrated that the permit is being exercised for the purpose for which it was issued, or if the work so authorized is suspended or discontinued for a period of one year.
(Code 2003, § 39-106(7)(A), (B))
Sec. 119-43. - Issuance of certificate of occupancy.
The building inspector shall sign and issue a certificate of occupancy if the proposed use of land or buildings, as stated on the application for such certificate and signed thereto by the owner or his appointed agent, is found to conform to the applicable provisions of this chapter and if the building, as finally constructed, complies with the sketch or plan submitted for the building permit.
(Code 2003, § 39-106(7)(D); Ord. of 7-9-2007(1))
Sec. 119-44. - Developments of regional impact (DRI).
(a)
The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 (O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-7.1, 50-8-7.2) authorized the department of community affairs to establish procedures for regional review of development projects that are of sufficient size that they are likely to create impacts beyond the jurisdiction in which the project will be located. The DRI review process involves the host local government, the reviewing regional development center (RDC), and other potentially affected local governments, RDCs and agencies.
(b)
Thresholds are used to determine whether a proposed development is a DRI. Because positive and negative impacts of DRIs are not necessarily confined to the host local governments' jurisdictional boundaries, impacts on other jurisdictions need to be assessed.
(c)
If a development project is submitted to the City of Porterdale for review, then the time deadlines imposed in by this chapter are suspended until the DRI review process is completed.
(Code 2003, § 39-106(8))
Sec. 119-45. - Nonconforming buildings and uses.
(a)
The elimination of existing buildings and structures or uses that do not conform with this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this chapter. It is also the intent of this chapter to administer the elimination of nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights.
(b)
Any structure or use of land lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this chapter and its amendments, but not in conformity with its use provisions, may be continued subject to the following provisions.
(1)
Unsafe structures. Any structure or portion thereof declared unsafe by an appropriate council may be restored to a safe condition, provided the requirements of subsection (b)(4) of this section are met.
(2)
Alterations. Any change in a lawfully existing nonconforming building, use, building site or yard area is subject to the following:
a.
No lawfully existing nonconforming building can be structurally altered, except repairs on the building or installation of plumbing fixtures required by law, changing of interior partitions or interior remodeling. Improvements on a lawfully existing nonconforming building shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the building as determined by the building inspector.
b.
No lawfully existing nonconforming building or lands, except those residential dwellings needing repairs on the building or installation of plumbing fixtures as required by law, can be substantially added to, moved, or extended in any manner unless such building or land is changed to conform with the provisions of this chapter.
c.
If a lawfully existing nonconforming building is moved, all nonconforming minimum yard requirements, as defined in this chapter, must be eliminated.
d.
Whenever an owner of a lawfully existing residential dwelling must make repairs on or installation of plumbing fixtures which will force the location of the future addition of the dwelling nearer the lot line than permitted, the addition to the dwelling shall be allowed to extend to the existing building line but no nearer the property line than any existing portion of the dwelling.
(3)
Extension. A lawfully existing nonconforming use is restricted to the lot occupied by such use as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. A nonconforming use must not be extended to include either additional building or land, except as permitted in this section, or unless the owner applies for and is granted a variance.
(4)
Restoration of damaged buildings. Unless otherwise specified, a lawfully existing nonconforming structure that is destroyed (damage equals or exceeds 50 percent of the structures' replacement value, as determined by the building inspector), through no intent of the owner, may not be reconstructed or restored to the same nonconforming use except upon approval of the zoning administrator. However, residential dwellings that are nonconforming because of area and minimum yard requirements may be replaced regardless of extent of damage.
(5)
Discontinuance. A lawfully existing nonconforming use which became such after the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and which has been discontinued for a continuous period of six months, shall not be reestablished. Any future use shall be in conformance with this chapter. Where government action impedes access to land, the time of any resulting discontinuance of a nonconforming use shall not be counted towards the time periods of this section.
(Code 2003, § 39-106(4))
Secs. 119-46—119-63. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - AMENDMENTS

Sec. 119-64. - Authority.
The council may from time to time amend the boundaries of the districts established on the official zoning map and/or the provisions set forth in this chapter. Proposed amendments shall first be submitted to the zoning commission for its recommendation.
(Code 2003, § 39-106(1)(A))
Sec. 119-65. - Application for amendment (rezoning application).
(a)
An application for amendment must be filed with the city clerk/treasurer at least 45 days prior the zoning commission meeting at which the request will be heard. An application for amendment must contain the following information:
(1)
A survey of the property prepared by the applicant showing existing and proposed structures and uses, access drives, easements, utilities, buffers, existing zoning, and any other supporting documentation required by the city clerk/treasurer to assist the zoning administration and council in rendering a decision, including concept plans.
(2)
A list of adjoining property owners as shown on the tax rolls.
(3)
Any additional information the applicant or the city clerk/treasurer believes to be pertinent.

(c)
Once the application is submitted it cannot be amended. Incomplete applications will not be processed.
(d)
The zoning administrator shall present the application and all its supporting documents, along with a written analysis of the requested zoning's impact, to the zoning commission at its regular business meeting the month in which the public hearing on the application is scheduled. The written analysis shall show that the zoning administrator has considered the proposed change in relation to the following, where applicable:
(1)
What is the existing land use pattern in the area?
(2)
Would approval create an isolated district designation unrelated to adjacent and nearby district designations?
(3)
Would approval significantly increase or possibly overtax available infrastructure, including, but not limited to, schools, streets, and public safety services?
(4)
Are the existing boundaries illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions on the property proposed for change?
(5)
Would changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment necessary?
(6)
Will the proposed change adversely influence living conditions in the neighborhood?
(7)
Will the proposed change create or excessively increase traffic congestion or otherwise affect public safety?
(8)
Will the proposed change seriously reduce light and air to adjacent areas?
(9)
Will the proposed change adversely affect property values in the adjacent area?
(10)
Will the proposed change be a deterrent to the improvement or development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations?
(11)
Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to an individual owner as contrasted with the public welfare?
(12)
Are there substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with its existing zoning?
(13)
To what extent is the proposed change consistent with the city's comprehensive plan?
(14)
What other factors, if any, should be considered in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety morality or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of the property?
(Code 2003, § 39-106(1)(B))
Sec. 119-66. - Public hearing, procedures, and rezoning standards.
(a)
Public hearing required. Before enacting an amendment to this chapter, one public hearing must be held by the zoning commission.

Publication of notice. Not less than 15 days, and not more than 45, days prior to the date of the public hearing, the city clerk/treasurer shall advertise the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in Porterdale. The notice shall also include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property. The notice shall further include a statement that any opponent of a rezoning action that has made, within two years immediately proceeding the filing of the rezoning action, campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to a local government official that will consider the application, must file a disclosure with the zoning commission showing:
(1)
The name and official position of the city official to whom the contribution was made; and,
(2)
The dollar amount and description of each campaign contribution made to the city official. The disclosure shall be filed at least five calendar days prior to the public hearing on the zoning application.
(d)
Sign.
(1)
In addition to the newspaper notice, and not less than 15 days prior to the zoning commission public hearing, the zoning administrator shall cause the applicant to have posted in a conspicuous place on the lot or parcel to be rezoned, one or more signs, which shall provide adequate notice of the zoning action. Each sign shall be approximately 32 inches in height and 24 inches in width and shall provide adequate notice of the zoning action. At a minimum, the sign must contain the following information: date, time, and location or the hearing, current zoning classification and proposed zoning classification, and a telephone number interested persons can call for additional information.
(2)
If, because of circumstances peculiar to the location of the property to be posted, the sign will either be inconspicuous or invisible from any well-traveled right-of-way, the sign shall be posted on the property to be rezoned and on other property in such a location that it is likely to be seen by persons potentially interested in the decision.
(e)
Zoning commission action. The zoning commission shall review the record and vote on the proposed amendment to this chapter or the zoning map. The commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. Within seven days of its decision, the zoning administrator shall so notify the applicant. If the zoning commission fails to act on the application within 60 days of its submission or by the next regularly scheduled zoning commission meeting (whichever is later) the application is deemed to have been approved unless the application or the matter is tabled, postponed, or withdrawn.
(f)
Council action. The council shall review the record, consider the zoning amendment criteria of section 119-67, and vote on the application. The council may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. Within seven days of its decision, the city clerk/treasurer shall so notify the applicant in writing. If the council fails to act on the application within 60 days of its submission or by its next regularly scheduled meeting, whichever is later, the application is deemed to have been approved unless the application is tabled, postponed, or withdrawn.
(g)
Withdrawal.
(1)
If an application for an amendment to this chapter or official zoning map is withdrawn in writing by the applicant at any time after the publication of the newspaper notice and posting of the required sign, but prior to the public hearing, then the same property may not be considered for zoning by the zoning commission until the expiration of at least 60 days immediately following the withdrawal of the rezoning application. The withdrawal must be in writing and signed by the applicant.
(2)
The application will be considered to have been withdrawn if the applicant, his authorized agent or his attorney fails to appear at the zoning commission and council hearing. By withdrawing in this manner, the same property may not be considered for rezoning by the council until the expiration of at least 60 days from the date of the scheduled public hearing for which the applicant failed to appear.
(h)
Denial.
