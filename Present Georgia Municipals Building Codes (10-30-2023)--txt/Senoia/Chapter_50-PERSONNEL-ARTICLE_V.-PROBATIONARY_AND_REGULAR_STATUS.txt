Sec. 50-82. - Regular status.
At least 15 working days prior to the expiration of the probationary period, the department head shall notify the personnel officer in writing whether or not the employee has satisfactorily completed his probationary period. If the employee's work record or attitude is not deemed at an acceptable level to warrant recommendation for career status, the department head may recommend dismissal or extension of the probationary period for a specified period of time not to exceed six months. If a probationary employee fails to qualify for regular status at the end of an extended probationary period, their appointment shall be terminated and they shall be removed from government service.
The city manager shall review recommendations from departments and shall approve or reject such recommendations. The effective date of regular status for original or promotional appointments shall be as designated by the department head and city manager. Never shall an employee be assumed to have attained regular status without recommendation of the appointing department and approval of the city manager.
