ARTICLE III. - DOGS

Sec. 10-30. - Running at large and restrictions on tethering.
(a)
Every person owning or having charge, care, custody or control of a dog shall keep the dog exclusively upon his own premises except that the dog may be off the premises if it is under the effective control of a person. The dog shall be construed to be under the effective control of a person if the dog is:
(1)
Confined within a vehicle, fencing or other adequate enclosure where the dog has no access to passerbys; or
(2)
Is attached to a leash not over six feet in length and held by a person of sufficient strength to restrain the dog.
(b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), a dog shall be deemed not to be under effective control of a person in the following situations:
(1)
When a female dog in pre-estrees, estrees, or post-estrees (in heat or in season) comes into contact with a male dog except for planned breeding; or
(2)
The dog inflicts injury to a person or inflicts damage to the property of someone other than its owner, custodian or possessor.
(c)
An owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog shall not tether the dog unless the following conditions are met:
(1)
Proper length. The length of the tether shall allow access to the maximum available exercise area and allow the animal free access to food, water, and shelter. No tether shall be less than ten feet in length. The length of tether shall not allow the dog to cross the property line on which it is tethered.
(2)
Proper weight. The weight of the tether shall not unreasonably inhibit the free movement of the dog within the area allowed by the length of the tether. A tether should not weigh more than one-eighth of a dog's body weight.
(3)
Proper material. The dog shall not be tethered by choke, chain, pinch, slip, halter, or prong type collar, or by any means other than with a properly fitted buckle-type collar or harness that provides enough room between the collar or harness and the dog's throat to allow normal breathing and swallowing.
(4)
Proper fit. The tether shall be properly fitted to the collar or harness. The tether shall not be attached to the dog in an area reasonably likely to cause injury or pain to the dog because of the entanglement or in an area likely to cause injury or pain to the dog because of surrounding structures or objections. The dog shall not be tethered in a manner that results, or could reasonably result, in the dog becoming frequently entangled on the restraint or another object. The tether shall allow the dog to sit, lie down, and stand comfortably without the restraint becoming taut and allow the dog a reasonable range of movement.
(5)
Free from injury, pain and interference. A tether shall not cause injury or pain to the dog because of the material of which it is made or because of the size or weight of the tether. If there are multiple dogs tethered, each dog shall be on a separate tether and not secured to the same fixed point. A dog shall not be tethered if it is ill, suffering from a debilitating disease, injured, in distress, in the advanced stages of pregnancy, or under six months of age.
(6)
Reasonable duration. A dog that is restrained outside by a tether may not be restrained for an unreasonable duration-of-time. Factors used to determine the reasonableness of the duration of time shall include, compliance with all other tethering restrictions pursuant to this section, physical condition of the dog, behavior exhibited by the dog and weather conditions.
(7)
Proper sanitation, adequate water and shelter. A dog shall not be restrained outside by tether in the case of extreme weather conditions, including conditions in which: the actual or effective outdoor temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit; a heat advisory has been issued by a local or state authority or jurisdiction; or a hurricane, tropical storm, or tornado warning has been issued for the jurisdiction by the National Weather Service. The shelter shall provide adequate protection from all elements such as rain, wind, heat and cold. A dog shall not be tethered in a manner that results in the dog being left in unsafe or unsanitary conditions or that forces the dog to stand, sit, or lie down in its own excrement or urine or in an otherwise unsafe or unsanitary space. A tethered dog shall have access to clean water and necessary shelter that is safe and protective while tethered. The shelter and water vessel shall be constructed or attached in such a way that the dog cannot knock over the shelter or water vessel.
(8)
Limited exemptions to tethering restrictions. Tethering restrictions do not apply to a dog that is:
a.
Tethered while it is receiving medical care or treatment under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian or is being groomed;
b.
Participating temporarily in an exhibition, show, contest, or other event in which the skill, breeding, or stamina of the dog is judged or examined;
c.
Being cared for temporarily after having been picked up as a stray or as part of a rescue operation;
d.
Being transported inside the main cabin of a motor vehicle or temporarily restrained or tied after being unloaded from inside the main cabin of a motor vehicle; or
e.
Being trained or used by a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency or military or national guard unit.
(9)
Penalty for first offense. A first offense in violation of subsection (c) shall result in a correction warning being issued requiring the offense to be corrected by the person who owns, keeps, or controls the dog within five business days after the date of the warning being issued in lieu of a fine or punishment provided by law unless the offense poses an imminent risk to the health or safety of the dog or the public or the dog has been injured or is suffering as a result of the offense, or the dog is likely to incur injury or suffer if the offense is not corrected.
