ARTICLE IV. - SPEED HUMPS

Sec. 3-4-350. - Purpose.
In response to an increasing number of complaints regarding speeding problems in residential neighborhoods, the Henry County Department of Transportation (the "department") has studied available alternatives and methods employed by other similarly situated communities and how effectively and successfully those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. The installation of speed humps was found to be a popular and relatively cost effective measure in reducing average speeds. When properly designed and installed, and with strong majority community backing and support, speed humps were found to be effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimenting and testing, including testing on Henry County roads, the use of speed humps has been widely endorsed by transportation authorities. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed humps has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). As a result of these preliminary efforts, the following procedures have been established for groups of citizens in Henry County who want to pursue the installation of speed humps in their neighborhoods.
(Ord. No. 97-03, 2-18-97)
Sec. 3-4-351. - Criteria for installation.
Henry County will consider the installation of speed humps only on streets classified by the department as local residential streets. Traffic studies conducted by the department must find that a speeding problem exists based on a standard eighty-fifth percentile of at least eleven (11) miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
(Ord. No. 97-03, 2-18-97)
Sec. 3-4-352. - Request for study; public hearing.
An authorized officer of an organized homeowners' association or the majority of homeowners within a platted subdivision may, through an informal petition or letter, request that a subdivision be studied for the speed hump installation. The letter or petition must demonstrate that the desires of a majority of the property owners in that subdivision are represented. The results of the subdivision traffic speed study may be directed to the subdivision representative by certified mail, or, upon request, will be presented by the department to a subdivision at a public hearing organized, arranged, and publicized by the subdivision group along with a general presentation on speed humps. All property owners in the subdivision shall be notified by an authorized representative of the subdivision group of the time and place of the public hearing.
(Ord. No. 97-03, 2-18-97; Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 3-4-353. - Preparation of the petition.
A formal petition in such form prescribed by the department shall be filed with the department requesting the speed humps be installed within the subdivision. All property owners in the subdivision shall be notified by an authorized representative of the subdivision group and afforded an opportunity to sign the petition. Each property owner shall indicate his or her preference for the installation of subdivision speed humps by marking a "YES or "NO" on the petition. If more than one (1) person owns the property, all parties shall sign the petition, individually to be counted. Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal property owner and may not sign petitions as related to this program. No valid signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the department. Each person signing the petition shall sign before a witness who shall be available to verify the signature of a property owner.
(Ord. No. 97-03, 2-18-97; Ord. No. 02-12, § 2, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 3-4-354. - Number of signatures required; filing of the petition.
At least fifty-one (51) percent of the property owners in a subdivision must indicate an affirmative preference for speed humps before a petition will be considered by the department for recommendation to the board of commissioners The percentages shall be calculated by dividing the total number of property owners by the total number of property owners indicating an affirmative preference. For purposes of determining the number of property owners in the subdivision, the geographical boundaries of the subdivision shall be established by the department using the data base of the county's taxing authorities. In the event a subdivision is not completely built out, a minimum of thirty (30) percent of the total number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the installation of speed humps will be considered. The completed petition must state the name and address of the representative of the subdivision group, it must be signed by the representative before a notary public and returned to the department where it will be checked against property tax records to insure that all requirements are met. Those petitions failing to meet specified requirements will be returned to the representative for compliance. Petitions meeting all requirements will be presented at the next regular board of commissioners' business meeting for approval or disapproval by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. No. 97-03, 2-18-97; Ord. No. 02-12, § 3, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 3-4-355. - Construction of the speed humps; warning posted.
The geometric design of speed humps has been proven to be a critical factor in terms of their safety and effectiveness in lowering speeds. Based on extensive research, speed humps shall be constructed with the following specifications:
Four (4) inches maximum vertical rise, twenty-two (22) feet in horizontal length, and incline-flattop-decline.
Each individual speed hump location shall require posting of standard warning signs that will be installed along the back of the curb within the county owned rights-of-way.
(Ord. No. 97-03, 2-18-97)
Sec. 3-4-356. - Procedure for removal.
The county shall remove speed humps under the following conditions:
(1)
A formal petition in the form as prescribed in section 3-4-353 above shall be filed with the department indicating that seventy-five (75) percent of the property owners request the removal of the speed humps;
(2)
The petition shall contain a statement acknowledging that the property owners are aware of the probability that vehicular traffic speeds within the subdivision may increase after the speed humps are removed; and
(3)
The humps shall not have been installed less than one (1) year from the date of receipt of the petition.
In the event a subdivision is not completely built out, a minimum of sixty (60) percent of the total number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the removal of speed humps will be considered.
(Ord. No. 97-03, 2-18-97; Ord. No. 02-12, § 4, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 3-4-357. - Timing.
