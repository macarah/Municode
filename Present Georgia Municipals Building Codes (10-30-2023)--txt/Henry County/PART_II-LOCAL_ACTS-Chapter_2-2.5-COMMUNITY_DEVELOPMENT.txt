Pursuant to Article IX, Section VII of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, as amended in 1984 (said amendment being set out at [as] Resolution Act No. 68, Ga. L. 1984, p. 1703), there is created one or more community improvement districts to be located in Henry County, Georgia, either wholly within the unincorporated area of the county, or wholly within any municipality in the county, or partly within one or more municipalities and partly within the unincorporated area of the county, each of which shall be activated upon compliance with the conditions provided in this section and which shall be governed by a board as constituted under Section 5 [Section 12-2.5-25] of this Act. The conditions for such activation shall be as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
There shall be adopted a resolution consenting to the creation of each community improvement district by:
(1)
The Henry County Board of Commissioners if the district is located wholly within the unincorporated area of Henry County;
(2)
The governing authority of the municipality if the district is located wholly within the incorporated area of a municipality; or
(3)
The governing authorities of Henry County and any municipality in which the district is partially located if it is located partially within the unincorporated area of Henry County and partially within the incorporated area of any municipality.
(c)
Written consent must be given to the creation of the community improvement district by:
(1)
A majority of the owners of real property within the district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district;
(2)
The owners of real property within the district which constitutes at least seventy-five (75) percent by value of all real property within the district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. For the purposes of this paragraph, value shall be determined by the most recent approved county ad valorem tax digest; and
(3)
The written consents provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be submitted to the Henry County tax commissioner who shall certify whether paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection have been satisfied with respect to each such proposed district.
(d)
No district or board created under this Act shall transact any business or exercise any powers hereunder until the conditions of this section are met. A copy of such resolutions shall be filed with the Secretary of State, who shall maintain a record of all districts activated under this Act, and with the Department of Community Affairs.
(Ga. Laws 1985, P. 4946, Act No. 502, § 4)
Sec. 2-2.5-25. - Administration, appointment, and election of board members.
(a)
Each district created pursuant to this Act shall be administered by a board composed of seven (7) board members to be appointed and elected as provided in this section. One board member shall be appointed by the Henry County Board of Commissioners if any portion of the district lies within the unincorporated area of Henry County, one board member shall be appointed by the governing authority of each municipality within which the district is now or hereafter partially located if any portion of the district lies within the incorporated area of such municipality, and the remaining board members shall be elected by the owners of real property within the district subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. The appointed board members shall serve at the pleasure of the governing body which appointed same, respectively. The initial elected board members shall serve for terms of office as follows: one-half thereof, or one less than half if an odd number, shall serve for two (2) years, and the remaining board members shall serve for four (4) years, respectively. Thereafter, all terms of office shall be for four (4) years, except the appointed board members who serve at the pleasure of the governing body which appointed them, respectively.
(b)
The initial board members to be elected as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within sixty (60) days after the adoption of the resolutions and the obtaining of the written consents provided in Section 4 [Section 2-2.5-24] of this Act at such time and place within the district as the Henry County Board of Commissioners, or the governing body of the municipality if the district lies wholly within the incorporated area thereof, shall designate after notice of the election shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Henry County once a week for three (3) weeks preceding such caucus. Thereafter, there shall be conducted biennially, not later than sixty (60) days following the last day for filing ad valorem real property tax returns in Henry County, a caucus of said electors at such time and place within the district as the board shall designate in such notice for the purpose of electing board members to those board member positions whose terms expire or are vacant. If a vacancy occurs in an election position on the board, the board shall, within sixty (60) days thereof, call a special election to fill the same to be held within sixty (60) days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within one hundred eighty (180) days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held under this subsection, notice thereof shall be given to said electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Henry County on four (4) dates, at least forty-five (45) days, thirty-one (31) days, seventeen (17) days, and ten (10) days, respectively, prior to such election.
(c)
The board members shall be subject to recall as any other elected public official by the electors as defined in this Act.
(d)
Board members, including appointed board members, shall be electors within the district. If a board member ceases to be an elector, such board member's position shall be declared vacant as of the date of the event terminating such status.
(e)
The board members shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. They shall elect one of their members as chairman and another as vice-chairman and shall also elect a secretary and a treasurer or a secretary-treasurer, either of whom may but need not be a member of the board.
(f)
If the boundaries of a district are subsequently changed after creation of the district to include land within a municipality which was not a party to the creation of the district, or if a municipality's boundaries are changed to include land within a then existing district, the governing authority of the municipality shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in Section 9 [Section 2-2.5-29] of this Act. If the boundaries of a district or municipality are subsequently changed after creation of a district to include land within the unincorporated area of Henry County and the district originally had no land within the unincorporated area of Henry County, the Henry County Board of Commissioners shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in Section 9 [Section 2-2.5-29] of this Act. The newly appointed board member in such cases shall take office upon the vacation of the first elected board member's office to be vacated, by expiration of term, death, resignation, or recall, and that office shall thereafter be appointed by such governing authority. If, by municipal annexation or by deannexation of land from a district, the district no longer includes land within the unincorporated area of Henry County or within a municipality, respectively, then upon such occurrence the board member of the district appointed by such governing authority in which the district is no longer located shall cease to be a board member and such member shall thereafter be elected as otherwise provided in this section.
(g)
Neither Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Election Code," nor Chapter 3 of Title 2 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Municipal Election Code," shall apply to the election of district board members. Should a vacancy in office occur of a district board member and the regular caucus of electors is more than six (6) months in the future, a special election shall be called to fill such vacancy, unless filled by appointment as required in this section. The district board may adopt such bylaws not inconsistent with this Act to provide for any matter concerning such elections.
(Ga. Laws 1985, P. 4946, Act No. 502, § 5)
Sec. 2-2.5-26. - Taxes, fees, and assessments.
(a)
The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed two and five-tenths (2.5) percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the county or municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Henry County if the district lies wholly or partly within the unincorporated area of Henry County or by the municipality within which the district lies if it is wholly within a municipality, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Henry County or the municipality, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Henry County or municipal ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of one percent thereof, but not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Henry County or the municipality who collects same to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized in this Act.
(b)
The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
(Ga. Laws 1985, P. 4946, Act No. 502, § 6)
Sec. 2-2.5-27. - Boundaries of the districts.
(a)
The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Henry County Board of Commissioners if wholly within the unincorporated area of Henry County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Henry County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated area thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in Section 4 [Section 2-2.5-24] of this Act or as may thereafter be added as provided in this section.
(b)
The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following:
(1)
Written consent is first obtained of a majority of the owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed and which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district;
(2)
Written consent of owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed which constitutes at least seventy-five (75) percent by value of the property which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. For the purposes of this paragraph, value shall be determined by the most recent approved county ad valorem tax digest;
(3)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and
(4)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the governing authorities of Henry County, if any portion of the district is or is to be in the unincorporated area of Henry County, and such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation.
(Ga. Laws 1985, P. 4946, Act No. 502, § 7)
Sec. 2-2.5-28. - Debt.
Each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Article IX, Section V of the Constitution of Georgia or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district.
(Ga. Laws 1985, P. 4946, Act No. 502, § 8)
Sec. 2-2.5-29. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this Act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing body of Henry County and any municipalities within which the district is partially located. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Henry County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and Henry County or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or county. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided in this district.

Sec. 2-2.5-31. - Bonds generally.
(a)
Notes or other obligations issued by a district other than general obligation bonds shall be paid solely from the property pledged to pay such notes or other obligations. General obligation bonds issued by any district shall constitute a general obligation of the district to the repayment of which the full faith and credit and taxing power of the district shall be pledged.
(b)
All bonds, notes, and other obligations of any district shall be authorized by resolution of its board adopted by a majority vote of the board members at a regular or special meeting.
(c)
Bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times (not more than forty (40) years from their respective dates), shall bear interest at such rate or rates (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time), shall be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors.
(d)
The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this Act. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.
(e)
There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district; and the usury laws of this state shall not apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of these districts.
(f)
Bonds issued by a district may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered, or both coupon and fully registered, and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability provisions as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may provide.
(g)
Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Henry County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
(h)
In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear, and the principal amount and maturities of such said bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.
(i)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.

(b)
The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by a district shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly as permitted in this Act, all or part of the cost of any project or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance with this Act.
(c)

The conditions for such activation shall be:
(1)
The delivery of a petition by any taxpayer, containing the project specifications for the proposed district, to the Henry County Board of Commissioners and, if applicable, the governing authority of any municipality in which any part of the proposed district is to be located;
(2)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the creation of each community improvement district, which resolution shall state that the district is created under the Henry County Project Financing Community Improvement Districts Act, and to the project specifications by:
(A)
The Henry County Board of Commissioners, if the district is located wholly within the unincorporated area of Henry County;
(B)
The governing authority of the municipality, if the district is located wholly within the incorporated area of a municipality and wholly within Henry County; or

(4)
If the proposed community improvement district is to lie in an area wholly or partially coexistent with one or more community improvement districts, then the governing board of the newly created district and the governing board of the preexisting district or districts shall have entered into a cooperative agreement whereby the collection of taxes and the provision of services in the overlapping areas of such districts shall be specified. The written consents and cooperative agreement, if required, provided for above shall be submitted to the Henry County Tax Commissioner who shall certify whether subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (2) of this subsection, as applicable, have been satisfied with respect to each such proposed district. No district or board created under this Act shall transact any business or exercise any powers hereunder until the foregoing conditions are met. A copy of such resolutions shall be filed with the Secretary of State, who shall maintain a record of all districts activated under this Act, and with the Department of Community Affairs.

(Ga. Laws 1991, P. 4339, Act No. 182, § 4)
Sec. 2-2.5-45. - Administration and appointment of board members.
(a)
Each district created pursuant to this Act which lies wholly within unincorporated Henry County shall be administered by the Henry County Board of Commissioners or by a five-member board appointed by the Henry County Board of Commissioners; provided, however, that so long as the directors of the Henry County Development Authority, created pursuant to the provisions of the Henry County Development Authority Act, Ga. L. 1967, p. 2291, as amended, shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Henry County, the members of the board of each community improvement district created hereunder shall be the same as and shall serve terms coextensive with the board of directors, as now or hereafter constituted, of the Henry County Development Authority.
(b)
Each district created pursuant to this Act which lies wholly within an incorporated area in Henry County or partially within an unincorporated area of Henry County and partially within an incorporated area of Henry County shall be administered by a board of which five (5) members are appointed by the Henry County Board of Commissioners and one member is appointed by the governing body of each municipality within which the community improvement district wholly or partially lies; provided, however, so long as the directors of the Henry County Development Authority are appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Henry County, the five (5) members of the board of each community improvement district to be appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Henry County shall be the same as and shall serve terms coextensive with the board of directors, as now or hereafter constituted, of the Henry County Development Authority.

The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed two and one-half (2½) percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property; provided, however, that no tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall exceed any lesser limitation designated in the project specifications and that no tax, fee, or assessment shall be levied beyond any time limitation designated as provided in the project specifications. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing the projects which are specially required by the degree of development within the applicable district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to Henry County or the municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Henry County if the district lies wholly or partly within the unincorporated area of Henry County, and by the municipality within which it lies if it is wholly within a municipality, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Henry County or the municipality, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Henry County or municipal ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied shall be transmitted by Henry County or the municipality who collects same to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized under this Act.
(b)
The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extent [extant] upon such event for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
(Ga. Laws 1991, P. 4339, Act No. 182, § 6)
Sec. 2-2.5-47. - Boundaries of the districts.
(a)
The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Henry County Board of Commissioners if wholly within the unincorporated area of Henry County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Henry County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated area thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in Section 4 [Section 2-2.5-44] of this Act or as may thereafter be added as provided in this Act.

(Ga. Laws 1991, P. 4339, Act No. 182, § 8)
Sec. 2-2.5-49. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this Act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing body of Henry County and any municipalities within which the district is partially located. If the parties to the cooperation agreement so agree, the cooperation agreement may provide that such private persons as are designated by the district perform the actual construction or improvement of the services and facilities provided by the district. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Henry County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and Henry County or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or Henry County. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein.

(a)
Notes or other obligations issued by a district, other than general obligation bonds, shall be paid solely from the property pledged to pay such notes or other obligations. General obligation bonds issued by any district shall constitute a general obligation of the district to the repayment of which the full faith and credit and taxing power of the district shall be pledged (subject to the power of the district to tax only in accordance with any limitations established by the project specifications).
(b)
All bonds, notes, and other obligations of any district shall be authorized by resolution of its board, adopted by a majority vote of the board members at a regular or special meeting.
(c)
Bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates; shall mature at such time or times, not more than forty (40) years from their respective dates; shall bear interest at such rate or rates, which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time; shall be subject to redemption on such terms; and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors.
(d)
The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted hereunder. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.
(e)
There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district; and the usury laws of this state shall not apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of these districts.

Bonds issued by a district shall be validated under and in accordance with Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A., the "Revenue Bond Law," or in accordance with such other successor provision governing bond validation generally as may be provided by law. Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Henry County shall be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.
(h)
In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear and the principal amount and maturities of such said bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest, which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time, and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate, which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time, so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint.
(i)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices of proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.

(c)
Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
