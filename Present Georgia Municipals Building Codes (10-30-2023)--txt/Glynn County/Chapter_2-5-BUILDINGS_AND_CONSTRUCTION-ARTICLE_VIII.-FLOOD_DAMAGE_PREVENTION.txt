DIVISION 2. - STATUTORY AUTHORITY, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

2-5-121 - Statutory Authority.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Glynn County Georgia, does ordain as follows:
2-5-122 - Findings of Fact.
a.
The flood hazard areas of Glynn County, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
b.
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
2-5-123 - Statement of Purpose.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
a.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
b.
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
c.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
d.
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and,
e.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
2-5-124 - Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
a.
To protect human life and health;
b.
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
c.
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
d.
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
e.
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
f.
To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and,
g.
To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in ANY increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
2.
Only if Section 2-5-137, paragraph d, subparagraph 1, above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this ordinance.

The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
b.
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in 2-5-141, subsection d.
2-5-140 - Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO Zones).
Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Section 2-5-127, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
a.
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 2-5-136, paragraph d, "Elevated Buildings".
The Building Official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
b.
New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required by this ordinance.
c.
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
2-5-141 - Coastal High Hazard Areas (V-Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 2-5-127, are areas designated as Coastal High Hazard Areas (V-Zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge, and therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. Note that other State and Glynn County regulations may require increased distances;
b.
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with Section 2-5-141, paragraph f, below;
c.
All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or shear walls; and
d.
All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on ALL building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the Standard Building Code.
e.
A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify, utilizing an elevation certificate, that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in Section 2-5-141, paragraphs b, c, and d herein.
f.
All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Breakaway walls, open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed:
1.
No solid walls shall be allowed; and,
2.
Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only.
3.
If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises.
g.
Prior to construction, plans for any structures having breakaway walls, latticework or decorative screening must be submitted to the Building Official for approval;
h.
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this Section;
i.
There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The Building Official shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered:
1.
Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction;
2.
Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and,
3.
Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping.
j.
There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage; and,
k.
Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of Section 2-5-141 are met.
2-5-142 - Standards for Subdivisions.
a.
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
b.
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
c.
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and,
d.
For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.
2-5-143 - Standard for Critical Facilities.
a.
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. Provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to critical facilities located on St. Simons Island.
b.
All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. Provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to critical facilities located on St. Simons Island.
2-5-144 - Variances.
a.
There is hereby created a FEMA Appeals Board (hereinafter referred to as the "Appeals Board") composed of the Community Development Director, the County Administrator, or the County Administrator's designee, and the County Engineer, or the County Engineer's designee.
b.
The Appeals Board, as established by the Glynn County Board of Commissioners, shall have the power to hear and decide requests for appeals or variances from the requirements of this ordinance.
c.
The Appeals Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Building Official in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. Appeals may only be filed by the applicant or Glynn County.
d.
Appeals shall be taken within 15 days following the decision or determination of the Building Official. Appeals shall be made by filing with the County Administrator a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Appeals shall be submitted on application forms obtained from the Building Official. Any communication purporting to be an application for an appeal shall be regarded as mere notice to seek relief until it is made in the form required. Appeals not taken with 15 days will be deemed abandoned and shall automatically be considered denied by the FEMA Appeals Board. All papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken shall forthwith be transmitted to the FEMA Appeals Board by the Building Official.
e.
Any party to the action before the FEMA Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Glynn County, as provided by O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
f.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
g.
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this ordinance is met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
h.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
i.
In reviewing such requests, the FEMA Appeals Board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance.
j.
Conditions for Variances:
(1)
A variance shall only be issued when there is:
i.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
ii.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship;
iii.
A determination that the special conditions or circumstances do not result from the action or actions of the applicant, i.e., a self-imposed hardship; and
iv.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The Building Official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
k.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the FEMA Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
