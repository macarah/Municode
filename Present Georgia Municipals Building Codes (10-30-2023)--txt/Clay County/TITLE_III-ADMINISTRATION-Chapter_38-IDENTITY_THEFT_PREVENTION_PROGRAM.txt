Chapter 38 - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM

Sec. 38.01 - Program adoption.
The Clay County Board of Commissioners operates a water and refuse collection system and an ambulance billing system through a third party ("utility") and developed this identity theft prevention program ("program") pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission's Red Flag Rule ("rule") codified at 16 CFR § 681.2, which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act of 2003. This program was developed with oversight by the county administrator ("program administrator") and approved by the Clay County Board of Commissioners. After consideration of the size and complexity of the utility's operations and account systems, and the nature and scope of the utility's activities, the board of commissioners has determined that this program was appropriate for the Clay County and therefore approved this program on April 21, 2009.
(Ord. No. 09-012, § (a), 5-19-2009)
Sec. 38.02 - Program purpose and definitions.
(A)
Fulfilling requirements of the red flag rule. Under the red flag rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to:
(1)
Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program;
(2)
Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
(3)
Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and
(4)
Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft.
(B)
Red flag rule definitions used in this program. The red flag rule defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" as "a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft". According to the rule, a county utility is a creditor subject to the rule requirements. The rule defines creditors to include finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies and telecommunications companies. Where nonprofit and government entities defer payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors. All the utility's accounts that are individual utility service accounts held by customers of the utility whether residential, commercial or industrial are covered by the rule. Under the rule, a "covered account" is:
(1)
Any account the utility offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and
(2)
Any other account the utility offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the utility from identity theft.
"Identifying information" is defined under the rule as "any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person", including; name, address, telephone number, Social Security Number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's internet protocol address or routing code.
(Ord. No. 09-012, § (a), 5-19-2009)
Sec. 38.03 - Identification of red flag.
In order to identify relevant red flags, the utility considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft.

(1)
Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
(2)
Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a customer or applicant;

(5)
Notice to the utility that a customer is not receiving mail sent by the utility;
(6)
Notice to the utility that an account has unauthorized activity;
(7)

(Ord. No. 09-012, § (a), 5-19-2009)
Sec. 38.06 - Program updates.
The program administrator will review and update this program at least once a year and as necessary to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the utility from identity theft. In doing so, the program administrator will consider the utility's experiences with identity theft situations, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, and changes in the utility's business arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, the program administrator will determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the program administrator will present the board of commissioners with his or her recommended changes and the county commission will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program.
(Ord. No. 09-012, § (a), 5-19-2009)
Sec. 38.07 - Program administration.
(A)
Oversight: Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this program lies with an identity theft committee for the utility. The committee is headed by the program administrator or his or her appointee. One of the members should have detailed technical knowledge of the utility's computer information systems. The program administrator will be responsible for the program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of utility staff on the program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the program.
(B)
Staff training and reports: Utility staff responsible for implementing the program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the program administrator in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a red flag is detected utility staff will provide reports to the program administrator on incidents of identity theft. Department heads are responsible to be familiar with the Identity Theft Protection Act and to meet with their staff to assess current compliance and document appropriate safeguard practices in writing.
(C)
Service provider arrangements: In the event the utility engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, the utility will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft:
(1)
Require that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and
(2)
Require that service providers review the utility's program and report any red flag to the program administrator.
(D)
Nondisclosure of specific practices: For the effectiveness of this identity theft prevention program, knowledge about specific red flag identification, detection, mitigation and prevention practices must be limited to the identity theft committee who developed this program and to those employees with a need to know them. Any documents that may have been produced or are produced in order to develop or implement this program that list or describe such specific practices and the information those documents contain are considered "security information" (as defined in the following paragraph) and are unavailable to the public because disclosure of them would be likely to substantially jeopardized the security of information against improper use, that use being to circumvent the utility's identity theft prevention efforts in order to facilitate the commission of identity theft.
"Security information" is defined as government data the disclosure of which would be likely to substantially jeopardize the security of information, possessions, individuals or property against theft, tampering, improper use, attempted escape, illegal disclosure, trespass or physical injury.
