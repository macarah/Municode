Fuel-burning equipment (incinerator) means any equipment, device or contrivance for burning any fuel except refuse and all appurtenances thereto, which is used for indirect heating and in which the material being heated is not contacted by, and adds no substance to, the products of combustion. Such equipment typically includes that used for; heating water, generating or super-heating steam, heating air as in warm air furnaces, furnishing process heat indirectly through transfer by fluids or transmission through process vessel walls.
Hand fired fuel-burning equipment means fuel- burning equipment in which fresh fuel is manually introduced directly into the combustion chamber.
Incinerator means any equipment, device, or contrivance used for the destruction and/or reduction of rubbish or other waste by burning, and all appurtenances thereto.
Multiple chamber incinerator means any article, machine, equipment, or contrivance which is used for disposal of refuse by burning and which consists of a series of three (3) or more combustion chambers physically separated by refractory walls, inter-connected by gas passages or ducts, lined with refractories having a pyrometric cone equivalent of at least 17, tested according to ASTM Method C-24, and is designed for efficient combustion of the type and volume of material to be burned.
Objectionable odor means an odor deemed objectionable by the public works director and at least twenty-five (25) percent of the people exposed to it if there are at least twenty (20) people so exposed or at least five (5) people if there are fewer than twenty (20) people exposed.

(1)
Initiation. Proceedings to abate the process or activity that causes hazardous waste to contaminate surface waters within the city shall be initiated by the city manager after investigation by the city utilities department and determination by the city manager that the hazardous waste and resulting contamination of surface waters threatens persons who come within the sphere of such hazardous waste. Upon recommendation of the city manager, the city attorney shall file with the city clerk a complaint stating the nature and location of the hazardous waste and of the process or activity causing such hazardous waste.
(2)
Notice of hearing. Upon filing a complaint as set out herein above, the city clerk shall issue a notice directed to the owner of the premises upon which the process or activity that causes the hazardous waste complained of is located and, if the person maintaining the same is a different person from the owner, then also to the person in control of such process or activity, calling on such person to show cause, either personally or by attorney, at the time and place directed by the city clerk, why such process or activity alleged to be causing such hazardous wastes to contaminate surface waters should not be ordered abated and/or removed by the municipal court. Such notice shall be served at least three (3) days prior to the date set for the hearing by any city police officer and shall be made either personally or by mailing a copy of the notice to the party's last known address, return receipt requested.
(3)
Order of abatement. If, after hearing all the evidence, the municipal court decides that the activity or process complained of causes hazardous waste that contaminates the surface waters, then the municipal court shall, by order, direct the chief of police to abate the process or activity creating the hazardous waste and may issue such other order as is necessary to prevent further contamination. A copy of such order of abatement shall be served on the party or parties that control such process or activity.
(4)
Effect of noncompliance. In the event of a refusal to comply with the order of abatement issued by the municipal court, the person controlling the process or activity that causes such hazardous wastes shall be subject to sanctions as set out in section 1-1-7 of this Code.
(Code 1958, § 16-23)
