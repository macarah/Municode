(1)
A minimum of ten existing trees, or ten percent of the existing trees, per acre of disturbed area shall remain on the site after the grading occurs. Each tree with a trunk diameter of 24 inches diameter breast height or larger may count as two trees toward meeting the minimum allowable coverage. If the current condition of the property does not include sufficient trees to meet the standards of this article then 20 percent of the remaining trees, six inches diameter beast height or greater shall be saved.
(2)
Land disturbance activities shall conform in all respects with the approved development plan. If any revisions are necessary, a revised development plan indicating the tree replacement area must be submitted to the zoning administrator for review and approval. This plan must show the location of the trees to be planted, their species, size, and tree unit points. If an insufficient number of trees are left on the site following the land disturbance activities, each tree less than the amount required shall be considered a lost tree and applicable penalties enforced. Specimen tree replacement penalties shall apply when appropriate as well.
(3)
If 25 percent or more of the trees required to remain are removed, in addition to the lost tree penalties, a penalty of $1,000.00 per tree, shall be assessed for each tree less than the amount required to be retained onsite. In any event, the total site density factor as established in the standards of practice of this article must be met prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval.
(4)
An as-built plan must be submitted and approved by the department of community development prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval. A development plan may be submitted as an as-built plan if no revisions or changes have been made to that plan.
(c)
Master plans. It is recognized that certain large tracts of land are planned for residential development or planned unit developments, and are developed in phases over many years. Large portions of these planned developments remain forest lands for many years and periodically require removal of certain trees to grow better. For those residential lands of ten acres or more, silviculture or selective thinning may be allowed subject to the following conditions:
(1)
An approved preliminary plan or master plan on file with the county zoning office.
(2)
An application for selective timber harvesting must be filed with the department of community development, which must include a map or plat of the property indicating the area to be harvested together with a silviculture plan prepared by a registered forester, engineer, or landscape architect. The silviculture (the timber management plan) plan must contain methods for protection of hardwoods from damage during the timber operation.
(3)
Only pine, yellow poplar, and sweet gum trees may be harvested and only to the extent that there remains in the harvest area the minimum total site density coverage as required in the tree replacement and protection standards.
(d)
Clear cutting is strictly prohibited. See section 86-67 for penalties.
(e)
Timber harvesting. See section 86-72.
(f)
Tree removal permit.
(1)
A tree removal permit shall be required for the removal of any tree with a diameter breast height of six inches or greater.
(2)
A tree removal permit shall be required for the removal of three or more trees with individual diameter breast heights of less than six inches.
(3)
Tree removal permit shall be posted within 24-hours of issuance.
(g)
Single-family residential. The removal of up to three trees, under 30 inches diameter breast height on any single-family residential property, within a two year period, unless such action is subject to a building permit that would allow land disturbance. However, no homeowner can remove trees within two years from the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for a residence when such trees have been preserved or planted by the developer or builder in order to meet the tree density requirements of this article.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.11; Ord. No. 2017-42, §§ 4, 5, 5-30-17)
Sec. 86-62. - Tree density unit (TDU) requirements.
(a)
TDU requirements. TDU requirements are outlined in section 86-73.
(b)
Minimum standards. On any site or development for which a development plan is required by this article, a combination of existing trees to be retained and/or new trees to be planted shall meet or exceed the required TDU standard per acre, exclusive of any acreage within a buffer area and any trees needed to meet buffer requirements of the zoning ordinance [appendix A] or conditions of zoning approval. The trees, both existing and new, shall be reasonably distributed through the site, with emphasis on tree groupings and trees visible from the roadways, to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees shall not be retained or planted for credit within a public right-of-way or clear zone without approval by the director of the department of transportation and development.
(c)
Additions or expansions. Site development which falls under the provisions of this article by virtue of additions or expansions as defined in this subsection shall be required to comply with the applicable TDU requested as established hereafter only and without regard to any specific placement of trees contained in this article regarding parking areas and regarding perimeter plantings.
(d)
TDU standard calculation. The tree density standard shall be calculated by summing the following credits and dividing by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application. To determine the required number of TDUs that are required by this article, two options are available.
(1)
Option 1. Calculate the total surface area of any proposed new impervious surface or improvements and plant new trees sufficient to meet the required TDUs for that area. Existing trees elsewhere on the site shall be excluded in the calculation of TDUs.
(2)
Option 2. Calculate required TDUs for entire site area according to zoning classification. Existing trees on the site may be counted to achieve required TDUs.
(e)
Tree credits. Tree credits shall be calculated as follows:
(1)
Credit for existing trees to be retained shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) by the units assigned in table A of section 86-73. Credit shall be given to all trees retained on a property having a diameter of four inches or more.
(2)
Credit for new trees proposed on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) by the units assigned in table B of section 86-73. Credit shall be given to all new trees on a property, except for new trees of less than two inches in diameter.
(3)
Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances:
a.
additional tree density credit may be granted by the department of community development for existing trees to be retained which have greater value as specimen, as defined herein.
b.
Existing trees to be preserved within a minimum yard area (as required by the applicable zoning district) or within a 100-year flood plain shall be granted a bonus credit of 50 percent of the units assigned in section 86-73 unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.12)
Sec. 86-63. - Tree preservation planting requirements.
The following requirements shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standards on a property. Mechanisms for compliance are defined within section 86-73.
(a)
Tree preservation area. A tree preservation area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained.
(1)
The tree preservation area shall include no less than the total area of the critical root zone of a tree or group of trees collectively.
(2)
Layout of the utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of the tree preservation areas.
(3)
Construction site activities, such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within the tree preservation areas.
(b)
Protective barriers.
(1)
Protective tree fencing, staking or continuous ribbon shall be installed between tree preservation areas and areas proposed to be cleared, graded or otherwise disturbed on the site, prior to any land disturbance. All protective barriers shall be installed according to the county standards of practice as determined from time to time by the tree commission.
(2)
All tree preservation areas are to be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted in addition to the required protection fencing, staking, or continuous ribbon. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree preservation standards are recommended for site entrances.
(3)
All tree preservation areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree preservation area.
(4)
All protective tree fencing, staking or continuous ribbon and all erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbance and construction process, and should not be removed until final landscaping is installed.
(c)
Encroachment. If encroachment into a tree preservation area causes irreparable damage to the trees, as determined by the county arborist, the development plan shall be revised to compensate for the loss in tree density. The irreparably damaged trees shall be designated "lost trees" and lost tree penalties shall be enforced. Under no circumstances shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of the article, nor shall plan revision activities stop the department from instituting action for violation of this article.
(1)
New trees proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard in a property shall comply with the following guidelines and the county standards of practice:
a.
The spacing of new trees must be compatible with site limitations and with responsible consideration towards species size when mature;
b.
Species selected for planting must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site;
c.
Species selected for planting must comply with the species recommended or allowed in section 86-70. Native/indigenous species are preferred;
d.
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor, so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability;
e.
In the event that new trees proposed to be planted to achieve the tree density standard are not installed or likewise compensated to the county tree bank or tree bank fund upon application for a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate), then a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to 110 percent of the value of the new trees and their installation shall be posted in accordance with the performance bonding requirements and provisions of the land development regulations;
f.
Upon final installation of new trees planted under the requirements of the article, and following acceptance by the department of community development, the owner shall warrant the new trees and provide for the replacement of those which do not survive for a period of no less than two years as determined by the department of community development.
(d)
Removal. Anytime a tree is cut within the county, the stump shall be removed and the land regarded where the tree was located.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.13)
Sec. 86-64. - Development plan specifications.
Development plans shall be prepared in accordance with the specifications for such plans contained herein.

(7)
Existing trees to be retained in the tree preservation areas: Trunk location, size and species (to the nearest inch in diameter at four and one-half feet above the ground) of individual trees four inches or greater diameter breast height proposed to remain for credit toward meeting the tree density standard on the property. Groups of three or more trees whose CRZs combine into a single tree preservation area may be outlined as a group and their species, number, by diameter, shown in the summary table. If the number and size of all existing trees to remain on the site exceeds the required tree density standard for the entire site, only those trees required to meet the minimum tree density standard must be shown. All tree preservation areas are to be outlined and labeled.
(8)
Tree preservation measures.
a.
A detail or description of the protective tree fencing, staking or continuous ribbon to be installed, and the location of such measures, which at a minimum shall follow the CRZ of all trees to be retained along adjoining areas of clearing, grading or other construction activity.

Trees grouped together in tree planting areas may be listed on the summary table by total number in the grouping, by size.
(10)
A summary table of the number of existing trees to remain and new trees to be planted by diameter to the nearest inch shall be shown, along with calculations showing the tree density achieved for the site. Additional credits shall be noted where applicable. Groupings of trees in tree preservation areas and areas for new tree planting may be keyed to the summary table by area rather than having each tree individually labeled on the plan.
(11)
Specimen trees to be identified and located.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.14)
Sec. 86-65. - Enforcement.
It shall be the responsibility of the department of community development to enforce this article. The director of the department of community development or his/her designee shall have the authority to revoke, suspend, or void any development or building permit, to withhold issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and to request the director of the department of transportation and development to revoke any clearing or grading permit. The director of community development shall also have the authority to suspend all work on a site or any portion thereof and assess fines and penalties where tree removal or damage occurs in violation of this article or the provisions of the approved as-built plan for the site.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.15)
Sec. 86-66. - Nonliability of county.
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to impose any liability upon the county or upon any of its officers or employees or to relieve the owner and occupant of any private property from the duty to keep trees and shrubs upon private property or under his control in a safe condition.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.16)
Sec. 86-67. - Violation and penalties.
Any person violating a provision of this article shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the county, and, upon conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, may be punished either by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per day, or confinement in the county jail not to exceed six months, or both. The court shall have the power and authority to place any person found guilty of a violation of this article on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. The owner of any property wherein a violation exists, and any builder, contractor or agent, who may have assisted in the commission of any such violation, may be guilty of a separate offense.
(a)
A violation of this article shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000.00 per day and/or a sentence of up to 30 calendar days incarceration per day per occurrence. Nothing herein shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violations. Replacement shall also be required.
(b)
In the event that a tree originally designated for preservation/protection is damaged and/or removed in violation of this article, said tree shall be designated a "lost tree" and violators shall be subject to replace the lost tree with trees having a total density equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four inch tree caliper or an equivalent payment to the tree bank fund. Furthermore, the location and extent of the tree's critical root zone shall permanently remain in a pervious state with no structures or buildings placed on it.
(c)
In the event that a specimen tree is damaged and/or removed in violation of this article, violators shall be subject to replace the specimen tree with trees having a total density equal to eight times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four inch tree caliper or an equivalent payment to the tree bank fund. Furthermore, the location and extent of the tree's critical root zone shall permanently remain in a pervious state with no structures or buildings placed on it.
(d)
In addition to the foregoing remedies, upon notice from the zoning administrator, work on any development that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article shall immediately cease. The stop-work notice shall be in writing and shall go to the owner of the property, or to his agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. When an emergency exists, the administrator shall not be required to give written notice prior to stopping the work. Further, in the event that work on any development is being done contrary to the provisions of this article, the administrator may revoke any permit previously issued by the county or any department of the county pertaining to the development activity for which the land disturbance permit has been issued, and may refuse to issue any further permit until, at the discretion of the administrator, the work on the development is brought into compliance with the provisions of this article.
(e)
In lieu of or in addition to the other remedies herein, the county attorney is authorized to file a petition seeking injunctive or other equitable relief to secure compliance with the provisions of this article. The county shall be entitled to its attorney's fees for any action through which relief is awarded.
(f)
If a violation were to occur anytime post certificate of occupancy or on any unimproved acreage then penalties shall be imposed based on the provisions of the recompense value for trees as set out in this article.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.17; Ord. No. 2017-42, § 6, 5-30-17)
Sec. 86-68. - Severability.
Should any part of this article be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the same shall not affect the validity of the article as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part declared to be invalid.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.18)
Sec. 86-69. - Effective date.
This shall become effective on June 26, 2008 and shall become a part of this Code. Notwithstanding the adoption of this article, tree removal activities which are undertaken pursuant to a validity issued, nonexpired development permit in effect on the date of the adoption of this article shall be subject to the regulations in effect at the time of the issuance of the permit; provided, however, that if the permit was issued only with respect to a portion or phase of a multi-phased development project, all further development of the project shall be subject to the provisions of this article.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.19)
Sec. 86-70. - Tree list.
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and protection for conservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees.
The following criteria are used by the administrator to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify, with the exception of trees designated as specimen trees for historic or cultural purposes.
The following list contains overstory and understory trees which are found in the Piedmont region and are recommended for use in meeting the tree requirements of this article. In selecting plant materials the standard for an overstory tree is that it attains a mature height in excess of 40 feet. An understory tree is one that does not reach 30 feet in height at maturity.
The majority of the planting should be large canopy trees. Understory trees and ornamentals should be used as accents or in places with limited space for larger crown development. Species diversity and use of native plantings are highly recommended and preferred. Constraints of urban sites may limit the use of diverse and less-suited native trees; however, use of varied and native species should be practiced whenever possible.

Please note: There is no set caliper for each type of tree as they vary in size (per contacts at landscape supply stores and nurseries). Root ball estimate: for a 2- to 2 1/2 inch in diameter tree, the root ball might be approximately 30 inch in diameter.
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, app. A; Ord. No. 2017-42, § 7, 5-30-17)
Sec. 86-71. - Specimen trees.
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and protection for conservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees.
The following criteria are used by the administrator to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify, with the exception of trees designated as specimen trees for historic or cultural purposes.
Size criteria.
• Large Hardwoods Trees: 24-inch DBH or larger—such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweetgums, etc.
• Large Softwoods Trees: 30-inch DBH or larger—such as pines, deodar cedars, etc.
• Understory Trees: Four inch DBH or larger—such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.
Condition criteria.
• At least ten years life expectancy.
• Trunk is relatively sound and solid with no extensive decay.
• No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
• No major insect or pathological problem.
Note: A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance.
In order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees, which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two times the assigned unit value shown in section 86-73. The CRZ of specimen trees will be protected with hog-back/wire-back tree save fencing with metal support posts.
If a specimen tree is requested to be removed, a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted to the administrator for approval.
Specimen trees that cannot be saved must be replaced with trees having three times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper by species with potentials for comparable size and quality.
Any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the administrator must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to eight times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper or an equivalent payment to the tree bank fund. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. Violations will be subject to the applicable penalties as described in section 86-67 of this article.

Further, such persons shall give notice of cessation of cutting within 24 hours after the job is completed.
(b)
The notice of harvesting operations required by this section shall be provided for each separate tract to be harvested. Such notice shall be made in such form as prescribed by rule or regulation of the Director of the Georgia Forestry Commission, and shall include the following information:
(1)
A map of the area which identifies the location of the tract to be harvested and, as to those trucks which will be traveling to and from such tract for purposes of picking up and hauling loads of cut forest products, the main point of ingress to such tract from a public road and, if different, the main point of egress from such tract to a public road. If multiple points of ingress and/or ingress will be used, all such points shall be identified;
(2)
A statement as to whether the timber will be removed pursuant to a lump sum sale, per unit sale, or owner harvest for purposes of ad valorem taxation under O.C.G.A. § 48-5-7.5;
(3)
The name, address, and daytime telephone number of the timber seller if the harvest is pursuant to a lump sum or per unit sale or of the timber owner if the harvest is an owner harvest; and
(4)
The name, business address, business telephone number, and nighttime or emergency telephone number of the person or firm harvesting such timber.
(c)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) below, the notice required by this article may be submitted in person, by transmission of an electronic record via telefacsimile or e-mail, or by mail.
(d)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (e) below, upon notification published by the Director of the Georgia Forestry Commission that a state-wide notification website or platform is available for public use, persons or firms wishing to utilize said website or platform to provide the notice required by this section may do so at their option, and Clayton County will accept notifications submitted in this manner.
(e)
On and after a date specified and published by the Director of the Georgia Forestry Commission, use of the state-wide notification website or platform shall be mandatory and shall be the sole means of providing the notice required by this section; on and after said date submission of the notice by any of the means listed in subsection (c) above shall cease and will no longer be deemed acceptable or in compliance with this section.
(f)
The notice required by this section shall not be or remain effective unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the director of community development or his or her designee a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting Clayton County against any damage caused by such person or firm in the amount of $5,000.00; provided, however, that at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of $5,000.00 may be provided in lieu of a surety bond. Such bonds or letters of credit shall be subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (g) and (h) of this section. No more than one bond or letter of credit shall be required from each person or firm harvesting timber, regardless of the number of tracts harvested in the county for so long as the bond or letter of credit remains in effect. The bond or letter of credit required herein shall be valid only for the calendar year in which it was delivered.
(g)
The bond or letter of credit required by subsection (f) of this section shall protect Clayton County against any damage requiring re-ditching or repair of existing ditch structures or the removal of any harvesting residue, including tree tops, debris, logs, pulpwood and other materials, placed in or around the county's rights of way caused by such person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall be available to reimburse the county for any cost incurred to repair such damages or remove such debris in or around the county's rights of way. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall also be available to reimburse the county for any costs incurred to maintain or repair county roads damaged by the ingress or egress of motor vehicles engaged in the harvest operations located within 500 feet of any point of ingress or egress of the timber harvesting operation. The right of Clayton County to call such bond or letter of credit in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this section shall be in addition to any other remedies available to the county at law or in equity for damage to county roads or rights of way.
(h)
When damage results from a person or firm's harvesting activities, the director of community development shall make and provide a written claim to the person or firm causing the damage within 30 business days after the director of community development becomes aware of the damage. Such claim may be given in person, by telefacsimile, email or mail. The claim shall describe the damage in detail and, in compliance with subsection (i)(1) of this section, give the person or firm the opportunity to repair such damage within 30 days of the notification; provided, however, the county shall be authorized to repair the damage immediately if the director of community development or his or her designee determines the conditions present a threat to public safety, health or welfare and, upon making such repairs, shall present to the person or firm and the issuer of the applicable bond or letter of credit an itemized list of expenses incurred as a claim against the responsible party and the issuer of its bond or letter of credit. Upon the issuance of a claim as provided in this section, the director of community development or his or her designee shall notify the issuer of the bond or letter of credit that a claim has been made and will be resolved or adjudicated according to the terms of this article.
(i)
Within 30 days of receipt of the written claim described in subsection (h), the person or firm against whom the claim is submitted may:
(1)
Repair such damage at his or its own expense with the approval and supervision of the directors of the department of transportation and development and the department of community development or their designees. When repairs are completed to the satisfaction of these directors, the director of community development or his or her designee shall provide a written notification of satisfactory completion within five business days to the responsible person or firm and to the surety issuing the bond or the bank issuing the letter of credit, thereby terminating the claim.
(2)
In the event of inclement weather or other factors preventing repair of the damage, request a 30 day extension to repair the damage from the director of community development, provided that no extensions shall exceed 90 days from the date the claim was tendered. Approval of any extension shall be at the discretion of the director of community development or his or her designee.
(3)
Appeal the claim to the Magistrate Court of Clayton County. Any such appeal must name the issuer of the bond or letter of credit as a party, who shall be served with all pleadings in the action and shall have the right to appear. The magistrate court will hear evidence and arguments within 30 days of the written appeal and issue a ruling within ten days of such hearing. Any such appeal shall toll the 30 day period, or any extension thereof required by subsection (h) of this section. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county. If the magistrate court rules in favor of the county, the court shall determine the amount of damages to which the county is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly; the director of community development, subject to approval by the board of commissioners, shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
(4)

(k)
In the event a bond or letter of credit tendered pursuant to the requirements of this section is revoked by the surety or bank, then a valid replacement bond or letter of credit must be delivered to the director of community development within five business days after the date of revocation in order for timber harvesting operations to continue. In addition, if the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit caused its revocation, the amount of the bond or letter of credit required shall be increased to $7,500.00 after the first revocation, and $10,000.00 after a second revocation caused by the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The maximum amount of the bond or letter of credit shall not exceed $10,000.00.
(l)
Submission of the notice required by this section shall authorize the person or firm submitting same to undertake the timber harvesting operation described in the notice and shall remain in effect until such time as the person or firm gives notice that the harvesting operation is complete; provided, however, that any change in the facts required to be provided for purposes of such notice, including but not limited to a change in the scope or extent of the operation, must be reported to the director of community development within three business days after such change.
(m)
Any person or firm that engages in a timber harvesting operation in the unincorporated portion of Clayton County without complying with the notice requirements of this section shall be subject to a citation and trial, and upon conviction shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 for each violation.
(n)
This section applies to activities which qualify as forestry land management practices or agricultural operations under O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(5) and (6) on land that is zoned for or used for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural purposes.

Sec. 86-73. - Tree protection and replacement standards.
The objective of the tree protection and replacement standards is to delineate the required methods of providing tree protection and replacement as determined by this article.
A basic requirement of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area (a standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with "tree."
This density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula:
SDF - EDF = RDF
SDF (site density factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (units per acre).
EDF (existing density factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
RDF (replacement density factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site.
The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by the desired density (minimum of 20 units per acre or greater).
The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units. Using table A below does this.
The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in table B.
Example: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 × 20 = 44
A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2-acre site. The tree inventory is as follows:
7—12 inch diameter pines
3—14 inch diameter pines
3—18 inch diameter oaks
1—21 inch diameter hickory
1—30 inch diameter oak
Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined as follows:
EXPAND
DBH Units No. of Trees Totals
12 inches 0.8 × 7 = 5.6
14 inches 1.2 × 3 = 3.6
18 inches 1.8 × 3 = 5.4
21 inches 2.6 × 1 = 2.6
30 inches 4.4 × 1 = 4.4
21.6
  RDF = 44 - 21.6 = 22.4

Note: Values for tree sizes 24 [inches] and greater are for trees that do not qualify as specimen trees and are not subject to specimen tree designation under section 86-71. Trees qualifying as specimen trees are subject to the benefits and restrictions note in the previously cited section.
Note: Multi-trunked trees shall be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk only. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit.

Tree planting standards.
Tree planting standards shall follow the requirements outlined in section 86-63 of this article. Additionally, the following guidelines shall be followed:
(1)
No more than thirty (30) percent of all trees planted for replacement density credit may be of any one (1) species.
(2)
Seven gallon pine trees to be planted to meet required replacement densities must be a least one inch in caliper and greater than or equal to four feet tall.
(3)
Specimen tree replacement/recompense trees must be at least four inch caliper.
(4)
No more than 20 percent of all trees planted for replacement density credit may be under two inch caliper.
(5)
The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with the spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration toward species size when mature.
(6)
Trees selected for planting shall be a species listed in section 86-71.
(7)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor, so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability.
The planting of materials shall conform to the standardized landscape specifications as identified in the most recent edition of the American Nursery and Landscape Association ("ANLA"), The American Standard For Nursery Stock, (2004), which document is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety herein (said document may be obtained by contacting ANLA at 1000 Vermont Ave NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20005 (202/789-2900). All trees shall have tops which display a natural growing shape or condition. Trunks shall be healthy and free of defects or mutations such as, but not limited to, over guying.
A secondary reference for tree planting and maintenance may be the best-practice recommendations of the International Society of Arboriculture (www.treesaregood.com).
It is also noted (per the Georgia Model Urban Forest Book):
(1)
Using a pneumatic excavating tool for excavation work that must happen inside the CRZ greatly reduces tree damage. This tool can remove soil around the tree's roots without harming them.
(2)
Preconstruction preparation and post-construction follow-up are essential to tree success, especially for larger trees. The older the tree the longer the post-operation care period.
(3)
When developing adjacent to or within existing forest, the shape and size of the resulting forest remnant is important to its success. Long narrow shapes with larger perimeters but small interior areas make it harder to develop successful tree preservation schemes but may be successful as buffers or wild life corridors. Rounder shapes make tree preservation easier.
(4)
Trees transplant better when they are dormant and the environmental conditions are not going to be a stress factor. This would be October until bud break. The fall is considered optimal because the earth is still warm and roots can grow somewhat before cold winter temperatures.
