Sec. 4.5 - Supplemental Requirements.
A.
Supplemental requirements for small drinking water supply watersheds: The following applies to all locations in a small drinking water supply watershed:
1.
New sanitary landfills are allowed only if they have synthetic liners and leachate collection systems.
2.
New hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities are prohibited.
3.
New facilities, which handle hazardous materials of the types and amounts determined by the Department of Natural Resources, shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by the Department of Natural Resources.
4.
All developments within the small drinking water supply watershed must comply with the Clayton County Water Authority Guidelines.
B.
Perennial Stream Corridors: The perennial stream corridors within a 7-mile radius of the drinking water intake are protected by the following:
1.
A 100-feet buffer on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
2.
Impervious surfaces are prohibited within a 150-feet setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the 150-feet setback areas on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
C.
Small Drinking Water Supply: The perennial stream corridors within the small drinking water supply watershed and outside of the 7-mile radius of the drinking water intake are protected by the following:
1.
50-feet buffer on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
2.
Impervious surfaces are prohibited within a 75-feet setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
3.
Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the 75-feet setback areas on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream bank.
D.
J.W. Smith Reservoir: In addition to the above, all lots abutting the J.W. Smith Reservoir property must also comply with the following restrictions:
1.
All such lots are to be at least 50,000 square feet in area.
2.
Such lots are generally to have a minimum depth of at least 400 feet. However, up to ten percent of such lots may vary from this standard; provided that compliance with the standard would pose a unique hardship due to the configuration of the reservoir property; and the average depth of nearly all such lots is 400 feet or greater.
3.
All such lots shall have a permanent 150-feet protection buffer adjoining the reservoir property. No septic tanks, septic tank absorption field, related structure or feature, substantial structure, or other feature which may adversely impact the reservoir may occupy any portion of this 150 feet buffer. Additionally, it is preferable that this area be a natural vegetated buffer.
4.
Access to the J.W. Smith Reservoir to conform to the Clayton County Water Authority policies.
5.
Sanitary sewer to be installed unless EPD indicates such sewer should not be installed.
E.
Supplemental requirements for large drinking water supply watersheds: New facilities located within 7-miles of a drinking water intake in a large drinking water supply watershed, which handle hazardous materials of the types and amounts determined by the Department of Natural Resources, shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by the Department of Natural Resources.
