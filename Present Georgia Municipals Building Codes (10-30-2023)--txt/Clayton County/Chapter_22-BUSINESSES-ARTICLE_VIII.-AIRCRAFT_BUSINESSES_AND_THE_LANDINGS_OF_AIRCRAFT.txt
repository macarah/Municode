ARTICLE VIII. - AIRCRAFT BUSINESSES AND THE LANDINGS OF AIRCRAFT

Sec. 22-500. - Findings; public purpose.
Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities within the Atlanta metropolitan area, which experiences are relevant to the issues and concerns encountered by Clayton County, and based upon the evidence and testimony of certain citizens of Clayton County, the board of commissioners takes note of the desire of certain individuals to engage in the landing of aircraft for business, recreation, and other purposes. The board of commissioners further takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to this activity, if unregulated. Moreover, it is the findings of the board of commissioners that, under certain circumstances, the landing of aircraft would be beneficial to various individuals. However, unregulated, such activity may lead to hazardous conditions and result in an adverse affect to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Clayton County. Accordingly, the board of commissioners deems it in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Clayton County to provide for the licensing of individuals who engage in the landing of aircraft for business purposes and the regulation of the landing of aircraft for recreation and other purposes. To this end, this article is hereby adopted.

Helicopter stop means a minimum facility without the logistical support provided at a helicopter port at which helicopters land and take off, including the touchdown area.
