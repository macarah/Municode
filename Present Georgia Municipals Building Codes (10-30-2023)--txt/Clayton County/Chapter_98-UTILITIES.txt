(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2010-11, § 3, 5-18-10; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-3. - Sewer service charges.
A charge is hereby levied on users of the Clayton County Water Authority's POTW for the total cost of operation and maintenance of such works, including replacement. The system of charges shall be established, maintained and annually reviewed and revised to assure that each recipient of wastewater treatment services pays its proportionate share of the total cost of operation and maintenance, including replacement. In setting said rates, factors such as strength, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered by CCWA and included as the basis for the user's contribution to insure proportional distribution of total operation, maintenance and replacement cost to each user or class of user. CCWA shall review user charges annually, and revise them periodically to reflect actual treatment works total operations, maintenance and replacement cost. Sewer user service charges and rates shall be set for the purpose of generating sufficient revenue to offset the cost of all treatment works operations, maintenance and replacement costs.
(1)
Service charge determination. Sewer user service charge shall be determined as follows:
a.
The said sewer user service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used by the said premises or facility therein or thereon as the same is measured by a water meter or meters therein used, or as otherwise currently established.
b.
Said sewer user service charge shall be established by a formula consisting of the fraction of the "total operation, maintenance and replacement cost per unit time" over the "total volume contribution from all users per unit time" multiplied by the "volume contribution from the user per unit of time".
c.
Said sewer user service charge shall consist of a charge per 1,000 gallons of water consumed, including adjustments thereto.
d.
Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in section 98-3(2) and that portion of the sewer user service charge for the portion of sewerage shall be computed according to section 98-3(1).
(2)
Other water sources. In the event a lot, parcel of land, premise or facility discharging wastewater, industrial waste, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into CCWA's wastewater system, or which ultimately enters the sewer system, is supplied either whole or in part, with water from wells, or any source other than CCWA, then such wells other source of supply shall be registered with CCWA, and if the water from said well or other supply is not measured by a water meter, the owner or occupant shall, at his own cost, install and maintain a meter on said supplies in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to CCWA. These meters shall serve as a control for the establishment of the sewer service charge and shall be read monthly or bimonthly by agents of CCWA.
(3)
Wastewater not discharged to POTW. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the manager that a significant portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the wastewater system, then the manager may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion that does not enter the wastewater system, and the correct meter flow will be used for billing of the sewer user service charge. All such additional facilities will be provided by the owner of the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to CCWA.
(4)
Termination of service. If the payment of the sewer user service charge and/or the industrial waste surcharge is allowed to go into default by the customer, CCWA may take appropriate action to terminate the customer's water and sewer service, until such time as all sums due for sewer service, including penalties, are paid in full.
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-4. - Industrial waste surcharge.
All persons discharging industrial waste into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following base-level concentrations:
A five-day, 20° C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 225 mg/l;
A Total Suspended Solids (TSS) of 225 mg/l;
A Total Kjehldahl Nitrogen (TKN) of 40 mg/l;
A total Phosphorus of 6 mg/l; or
Any other pollutants in excess of the "normal" level of such pollutants.
The amount of such surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by CCWA in handling the excess pollutants. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of the following: fixed charges for maintenance, operation and replacement of the sewerage system to include sewers, plants, pumping stations and other necessary systems including depreciation and other incidental expenses.
(1)
Surcharge determination. When the concentration of BOD, TSS, TKN, or Phosphorus of the water or waste accepted for admission to CCWA's wastewater system exceeds the base-level concentration for such element, the excess concentration shall be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula:
Amount of surcharge = [B1 (B) + S1 (S) + N1 (N) + P1 (P) + X1 (X)] V
B1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of BOD.
B = concentration of BOD from the user above the base-level concentration for such element.
S1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of TSS.
S = concentration of suspended solids from the user above the base-level concentration for such element.
N1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of TKN.
N = concentration of TKN from the user above the base-level concentration for such element.
P1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of Phosphorus.
P = concentration of Phosphorus from the user above the base level concentration for such element.
X1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of any pollutant.
X = total contribution of any pollutant from the user above the base level concentration for such pollutant.
V = volume contributed from the user per unit time.
(2)
Annual review and billing. The rates of surcharges shall be reviewed annually by CCWA in order that the above factors may correctly represent current treatment cost, and may be modified at any time. Industrial waste surcharges provided for herein shall be prepared and rendered with the regular water and sewerage bill.
(3)
Flow measurement. The volume of flow used to compute industrial waste surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by CCWA. In the event that a person discharging waste into the public wastewater system produces evidence to the manager that a significant portion of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the public sewer system, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be agreed upon between the manager and the persons discharging industrial waste into the sewer. Some installations will require wastewater flow measurement as agreed upon by the manager and the persons discharging the industrial waste into the sewer. At the manager's discretion, any permitted significant or categorical industrial user may be required to install a flow meter that measures instantaneous maximum flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM).
(4)
Sampling frequency and methodology. The industrial waste of each person discharging the same into the public wastewater system shall be subject to periodic inspection and determination of characteristics and concentration of said waste shall be made semi-annually, or more often as may be deemed necessary by CCWA. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the actual quality of the waste. All measurements, tests and analyses of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with sections 98-11(a) and (b).
(5)
Disputes. In the event that an analysis of waste as determined by the sampling and gauging of waste from a person or industry by CCWA is disputed, a program of resampling and gauging, with subsequent chemical determinations may be instituted as follows:
a.
The person or industrial user interested must submit a request for resampling and gauging of their waste to CCWA by letter and bind themselves to bear the expenses incurred by CCWA in the resampling and gauging and subsequent chemical determination of the waste.
b.
The chemist or engineer employed by the company or person responsible for the request submitted to CCWA must confer with CCWA's representative in charge of gauging and sampling. They will establish the length of the rerun and the methods to be employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow.
c.
The chemist or engineer engaged by the person or industry may be present during the gauging and sampling operation and also in the laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis.
d.
The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and quality of the flow shall be considered as analysis of record and shall be used to establish current billing procedures.

It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within Clayton County, or the area under the jurisdiction of CCWA, any wastewater or other polluted waters, including septic tank effluent or cesspool overflow to any open drain or well-penetrating, water bearing formation, except where suitable treatment has been provided in the accordance with this article.
(a)
Prohibited discharge standards.
(1)
General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
(2)
Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
a.
Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140º F (60ºC) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
b.
Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 12.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;
c.
Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case solids greater than one-half inch (0.5") in any dimension;
d.

(3)
Other prohibitions. The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste shall be limited in discharges to the public sanitary sewers to concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. CCWA may set limitations lower than the limitations established in the regulations below if, such more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In determining acceptability, CCWA will consider the quantity of subject waste in relation to the flows and velocities in the sewers, materials or construction of the sewer, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant, the toxicity of the pollutant, its persistence, degradability, and other pertinent factors. The limitations and restrictions on the materials or characteristics of the wastes or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without written approval of the manager or his designated representative are as follows:
a.
Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair;
b.
Wastewater that imparts color, which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes, and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating CCWA's NPDES permits;
c.
Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
d.
Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the manager;
e.
Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes;
f.
Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the manager in a wastewater discharge permit;
g.
Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test;
h.

k.
Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment process employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such a degree that the wastewater plant effluent can not meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over the discharge to the receiving waters.
l.
Water or wastes containing taste and odor producing contaminants in such quantities that after treatment of sewage these contaminants impart their taste and odor to receiving waters.
m.
Any contaminant that is harmful to the operation or efficiency of wastewater treatment plants, or to the health and welfare of the residents of Clayton County.
n.
Ground paper products shall be prohibited from discharge to the POTW.
o.
Discharges of materials or substances that would cause the effluent quality from wastewater treatment plants to violate state and federal standards.
p.
Total Residual Chlorine in concentrations of greater than four mg/l, unless agreed upon by the manager to allow a higher limit based on demand in sewer collection system.
(4)
If any water or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances identified in section 98-6(a) (1), (2) or (3), and which may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the manager may:
a.
Reject the wastes,
b.
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the POTW;
c.
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or
d.
Require surcharge payment to cover additional cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges.
If the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows is allowed, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval by CCWA. An owner or operator of any source to which the pretreatment standards are applicable shall comply with 40 CFR Part 403, as the same may be, from time to time, amended or replaced.
(5)
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW.
(b)
National categorical pretreatment standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated.
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, CCWA may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2.
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, CCWA shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(5)
Where CCWA's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, CCWA may apply to the approval authority for modification of these specific limits. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of a pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 403, Sec. 403.7(c)(2). CCWA may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 403, Sec. 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division is obtained.
(c)
State pretreatment standards. State pretreatment standards located at Chapter 391-3-6-.08 of Georgia Rules and Regulations for Water Quality Control are hereby incorporated.
(d)
Local limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits (mg/l):
(1)
Arsenic 0.208
(2)
Cadmium 0.029
(3)
Chromium 11.005

The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The manager may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration- based limitations above.
(e)
Right of revision. CCWA reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(f)
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The manager may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2007-180, §§ 2(a), 2(b), 11-20-07; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-7. - Pretreatment of wastewater.
(a)
Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 98-6(a) of this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or CCWA, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to CCWA for review and approval before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to CCWA under the provisions of this article.
(b)
Additional pretreatment measures.
(1)
Whenever deemed necessary, CCWA may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
(2)
CCWA may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
(3)
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(4)
When required by CCWA, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable structure together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of waste by CCWA and its employees. Such structure when required shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by CCWA. The structure shall be installed by the owner at his own expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(5)
Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Additionally, any user that handles hazardous wastes, any priority pollutant as shown on the EPA list, or any prohibited materials shall, upon request of the manager, provide proof of protection from accidental discharge of hazardous wastes, priority pollutants or prohibited materials. Facilities to prevent the accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense.
(c)
Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, CCWA shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. CCWA may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, CCWA may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the manager of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by section 98-10(f) of this article; and
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(d)
Hauled wastewater.
(1)
Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by CCWA, and at such times as are established by CCWA. Such waste shall not violate section 98-6 of this article or any other requirements established by CCWA. Septic tank waste haulers are required to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
(2)
The manager shall require haulers of waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The manager may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The manager also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled waste is subject to all other requirements of this article.
(3)
Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by CCWA. No load may be discharged without prior consent of CCWA. CCWA may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. CCWA may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
(4)
Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
(e)
Groundwater remediation sites.
(1)
Groundwater remediation site wastewater may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by CCWA, and at such times as are established by CCWA. Such waste shall not violate section 98-6 of this article or any other requirements established by CCWA. The manager shall require groundwater remediation sites to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
(2)
CCWA also may prohibit the discharge of groundwater remediation site wastewater. The discharge of groundwater remediation site wastewater is subject to all other requirements of this article.
(3)
No wastewater may be discharged without prior consent of CCWA. The manager may collect samples of the discharge to ensure compliance with applicable standards.
(f)
Food service facility grease management program.
(1)
The purpose of this program is to minimize the introduction of fats, oils, and greases into the Clayton County Water Authority (CCWA) wastewater collection system. The main components of the program are the proper sizing, installation, and maintenance of grease interceptors. The administrative and inspection requirements of food service facilities are established herein as well.
(2)
General criteria:
a.
Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or remodeled food service facilities inside the CCWA Wastewater Service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to CCWA that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. All interceptor units shall be of the type and capacity approved by the county and CCWA.
b.
Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by CCWA.
c.
Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the CCWA wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under CCWA's grease management program in the following manner:
1.
CCWA will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease management program. The as needed inspection shall be determined by the CCWA.
2.
Each food service facility in the vicinity of the problem area will be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance records will also be reviewed.
3.
Following the inspections, CCWA will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one or more of the following actions:
(i)
Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance.
(ii)
After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be issued a letter of violation and, if such facility fails to achieve compliance, it shall be required to develop and submit to CCWA a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment.
(iii)
Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance.
4.
Alteration of an existing grease trap is prohibited by CCWA. If alteration is found, then an approved, properly sized grease interceptor will be required to bring the facility into compliance according to the grease management program.
d.
Waste minimization plan. Food service facilities shall develop and implement a waste minimization plan pertaining to the disposal of grease, oils, and food particles. Educational materials are available from CCWA environmental compliance regarding the minimization of these wastes.
e.
Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor.
f.
Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at anytime. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain line(s). A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by CCWA. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible.
(3)
Design criteria:
a.
Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the county plumbing standards and outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of CCWA. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology.
b.
Access. Outdoor grease interceptors shall be provided with two manholes terminating 1-inch above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chamber(s) as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer.
c.
Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas).
d.
Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
e.
Interceptor sizing.
1.
Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds 3,000 gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two results.
(i)
Interceptor Capacity (gallons) = (S) x (25) x (Hr/12)
S = Number of Seats
Hr = Maximum hours of daily operation (Include preparation and clean up time)
(ii)
Interceptor Capacity (gallons) = (Sum of fixture flows) x (20)

  Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by CCWA. CCWA reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula.
(4)
Grease interceptor maintenance:
a.
Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited.
b.
Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by CCWA.
c.
Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed CCWA's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 25 percent of the total depth of the trap, CCWA will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply.
d.
Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by CCWA to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system. Responsibility for waste removed from or found in a grease interceptor or waste improperly disposed of shall be placed upon the private company generator food service facility owner.
e.
Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to CCWA. Such additives shall include, but are not be limited to commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein.
f.
Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.
(5)
Administrative requirements:
a.
Initial data acquisition. All food service facilities will be asked to complete a data sheet to establish the grease interceptor database. The CCWA database will be updated with additional or modified information after each yearly inspection.
b.
Administrative fees. No fee will be charged for an annual inspection by CCWA. However, if the user's grease interceptor is not in compliance with this section, up to a $200.00 re-inspection fee may be charged for each inspection thereafter until compliance is achieved.
c.
Inspection and entry. Authorized personnel of CCWA, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have the right to enter upon all properties subject to this program, at any time and without prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or record review, as part of this program.
d.
Record retention and reporting. All users must keep a record of any cleaning or maintenance of their grease interceptor. The following records must be kept on-site at the food service facility for a period of three years. Manifests are required for all grease interceptors and shall contain the following information:
1.
Food service facility (generator) information, including name, address, volume pumped, date and time of pumping, and generator signature verifying the information.
2.

Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under setion 98-10(e) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 98-10(a),(c), and (d) of this article.
(2)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(5)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(j)
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(k)
Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the manager's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the manager, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
(l)
Electronic reporting. The manager may allow reports, including monitoring information, to be submitted on electronic media or electronically using the Internet. In such cases, the user shall acquire the necessary software as approved by the manager, at their own expense. The manager may require an original report, signed and certified, using conventional methods in addition to the electronic format.
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-11. - Compliance monitoring.
(a)
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(b)
Sample collection.
(1)
Except as indicated in section (2), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, CCWA may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(3)
All sampling and analysis done for compliance purposes must be accompanied by proper chain-of-custody documentation.
(c)
Right of entry: inspection and sampling. CCWA shall have the right to enter the premises of any user as permitted by law to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
(1)
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the manager will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
(2)
The manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
(3)
The manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least biannually to ensure their accuracy.
(4)
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
(5)
Unreasonable delays in allowing the manager access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
(d)
Search warrants. If the manager has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of CCWA designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Magistrate Court of Clayton County, Georgia.
(e)
Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or CCWA, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period.
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-12. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
CCWA shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3)
Any other discharge violation that has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in CCWA's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8)
Any other violation(s) that will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-13. - Enforcement remedies.
(a)
Administrative enforcement remedies.
(1)
Notification of violation. When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within five days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(2)
Increased self-monitoring. CCWA may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to increase the self- monitoring frequency for any or all parameters. The user will be responsible for all sampling, analyses, and reporting under an increased self-monitoring order.
(3)
Consent orders. CCWA may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 98-13(a)(5) and (6) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(4)
Show cause hearing. CCWA may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 20 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(5)
Compliance orders. When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, CCWA may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(6)
Cease and desist orders. When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or when the user's past violations are likely to recur, CCWA may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
a.
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
b.
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(7)
Administrative fines.
a.
When CCWA finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, CCWA may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
b.
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 20 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at the rate allowed by law, not to exceed a rate of 18 percent per annum. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
c.
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for CCWA to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, CCWA may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. CCWA may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
d.
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(8)
Emergency suspensions. CCWA may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. CCWA may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
a.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, CCWA may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. CCWA may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in setcion 98-13(a)(9) of this article are initiated against the user.
b.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 98-13(a)(4) or (9) of this article.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(9)
Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 98-9(f) of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
a.
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
b.
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
c.
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
d.
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
e.
Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 98-6 of this article.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 98-13(a)(4) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by CCWA shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(10)
Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(b)
Judicial enforcement remedies.
(1)
Injunctive relief. When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the manager may petition the Superior Court of Clayton County through CCWA's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(2)
Civil penalties.
a.
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to CCWA for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000.00 per violation, per day and a minimum of $1,000.00. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
b.
The manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by CCWA.
c.
In addition to the above-described penalties and damages, the law of the State of Georgia, O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5 can be used to abate any public nuisance resulting from a violation this article.
d.
In addition to the above-described penalties and damages, the law of the State of Georgia, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-52, grants the Department of Natural Resources the power to fine violators up to a maximum of $50,000.00 per day.
e.
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
f.
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(3)
Criminal prosecution.
a.
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than sixty (60) days, or both.
b.
In addition to the above-described criminal penalties, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53 imposes misdemeanor penalties up to $25,000.00 per day and imprisonment up to one year, and for far more serious offenses, imposes felony penalties up to $250,000.00 and imprisonment up to 15 years.
(4)
Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. Any, all, or any combination of these actions may be taken against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with CCWA's enforcement response plan. However, CCWA may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, CCWA is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 03-128, § 10, 9-16-03; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-14. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Upset.
(1)
For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3), below, are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(b)
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 98-6(a)(1) of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 98-6(a)(2)c. through g. of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when CCWA was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permits, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(c)
Bypass.
(1)
For the purposes of this section,
a.
"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice to the manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
a.
Bypass is prohibited, and the manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
1.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
2.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
3.
The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
b.
The manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (c)(4)a of this section.
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18)
Sec. 98-15. - Miscellaneous provisions.
(a)
Pretreatment charges and fees. CCWA may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating CCWA's pretreatment program that may include:
(1)
Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications;
(2)
Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
(3)
Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction;
(4)
Fees for filing appeals; and
(5)
Other fees as CCWA may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by CCWA.
(b)
Hardship variances. Any person or user, upon written application to the manager, who shows, in the case of the activity being conducted or operated, that compliance with a section of this article should either be impossible or would constitute an undue hardship because of time limitations, may be granted a variance. The variance, granted by the manager, shall be for a reasonable time. The manager may grant a variance on the condition that the person receiving it submit plans for the installation of pretreatment facilities to the manager within six months from the date of issuance of the variance. A variance shall not be granted under the provisions of this section where the person applying therefore is causing a nuisance or other injury to the public. Any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall not relieve the person receiving the variance from any liability or penalties imposed by law for the commission or maintenance of a public nuisance.
(c)
Severability. If any provision of this article is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be effected and shall continue in full force and effect.
(d)
Recovery of costs incurred. CCWA shall have the right to bill a User for recovery of costs incurred when said user is determined to be in violation of the regulations in this sewer use article.

ARTICLE III. - EMERGENCY WATER CONSERVATION PROCEDURES[3]

Footnotes:
--- (3) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 99-106 § 1, adopted Oct. 19, 1999, set out provisions for emergency water conservation procedures. For the purposes of categorization, said provisions have been included as §§ 98-31—98-34 at the discretion of the editor. See the Code Comparative Table.

Sec. 98-31. - Delegated authority to determine water emergency.
The Clayton County Water Authority (CCWA) board of directors and their designees shall be empowered to declare water emergencies and implement water conservation measures during emergency conditions. Authority to declare water emergencies and implement water conservation measures during emergencies shall continue until withdrawn by the repeal of this article.
(Ord. No. 99-106, § 1, 10-19-99)
Sec. 98-32. - Emergency water conditions.
For the purposes of this article only, emergency water conditions shall be defined as: the period of time including times of drought, low stream flows, interruptions in the raw water supply due to breaks or contamination; inability of filter plants to meet demand; excessive losses or demands in the distribution system due to breaks, fires or other causes; contamination in the finished water; or any other purpose for which the curtailed use of water might be responsibly required in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare.
(Ord. No. 99-106, § 1, 10-19-99)
Sec. 98-33. - Emergency water conservation measures and procedures.
Water conservation measures shall include those found in subsections (1) and (2), below, but are not limited to subsections (1) and (2):
(1)
Restrictions or prohibitions on nonessential uses such as swimming pool filling, watering of lawns and gardens; washing of motor vehicles, recreational uses; and other uses that the CCWA may deem to be nonessential.
(2)
The type, nature, degree, commencement and duration of restrictions or prohibitions are to be determined by the CCWA general manger as director by the CCWA board of directors.
(3)
Whenever it is necessary to impose water conservation restrictions the existence of restrictions or prohibitions imposed under the dictates of this section shall be published weekly in the county organ in the non-legal section [setting] forth the specific nature of the restrictions or prohibitions; the reasons why the restrictions or prohibitions have been imposed; the date upon which the restrictions or prohibitions became or will become effective; and, at the appropriate time, the date upon which the restrictions or prohibitions are rescinded. The restrictions or prohibitions shall become effective no sooner that the first day following the publication date of the first notice.
