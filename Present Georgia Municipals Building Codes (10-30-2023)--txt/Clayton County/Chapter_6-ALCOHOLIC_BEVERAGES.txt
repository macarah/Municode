This prohibition shall not apply to the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption hereunder to the registered guests of any hotel or motel in their designated rooms.
(Code 1973, § 2-3-65)
Sec. 6-161. - Adult entertainment.
(a)
Findings; public purpose. Based on the experiences of other urban counties, including but not limited to this county, Fulton County, and Richmond County, Georgia; and other urban municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Smyrna, Georgia, Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, California, and Indianapolis, Indiana, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by this county; and based on the Austin City Study from Austin, Texas, and other opinions proffered by the county's police department and court personnel, the board of commissioners takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country.
(1)
It is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in criminal activity, and economic blight and diminution in property values of the surrounding areas.
(2)
Among the acts of criminal activity behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described.
(3)
Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses, to insure that adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts.
(4)
The purpose of this section is to prohibit certain types of attire, conduct and activity in the form of adult entertainment within establishments licensed to serve alcoholic beverages, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that the prohibition of adult entertainment cannot de facto be inclusive, otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to establishments serving alcoholic beverages and offering adult entertainment, this section represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the prohibition of adult entertainment in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
Therefore, the prohibition of adult entertainment in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcoholic beverages and provide adult entertainment. To that end, this section is hereby adopted.
(b)
