(a)
The provisions of this section shall apply to all employees of the county.

Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context indicates a different meaning:
Classified employee shall mean any individual employed by the county who is subject to the jurisdiction and receives benefits under provisions of the Clayton County Civil Service Act.
Unclassified (full-time, permanent) employee shall mean any individual employed in a full-time, permanent capacity by the county who is not subject to the jurisdiction but may receive certain benefits under the provisions of the Clayton County Civil Service Act.
Other unclassified employee shall mean any individual employed in a temporary, or part-time, or seasonal capacity by the county, or is currently in a probationary status (as defined by the Clayton County Civil Service Rules and Regulations) or otherwise is not subject to that jurisdiction of the Clayton County Civil Service Act.
100 percent full salary shall mean an amount equal to the payment required under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act of the State of Georgia, and an additional amount contributed by the county which together shall equal 100 percent of the employee's salary at the time of the injury.
On-the-job injury shall mean an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment (as defined under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act) which first gives rise to an employee's eligibility to receive 100 percent full salary under this section. Any subsequent injury in the same calendar year shall not constitute a "new" on-the-job injury.
(c)
Any classified employee or unclassified (full-time, permanent) employee who suffers from a new on-the-job injury that is compensable under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act may receive 100 percent full salary during the period such employee is unable to return to work as certified by a workers' compensation panel physician. Receipt of 100 [percent] full salary during such period shall be subject to the following conditions:
(1)
The employee sustaining an injury shall notify his/her supervisor, elected official or department director within 48 hours of the injury. The report of the injury shall be promptly forwarded or otherwise reported by the supervisor, elected official or department director to the insurance/risk management office (or their designee) and shall be supplemented, if necessary, to completely describe the injury and all related circumstances.
(2)
A physician selected by the county may be used to perform an independent medical examination to determine the extent of the employee's injury, the disability of the employee, the physical ability of the employee to continue to perform the duties of the employee's position, the physical condition of the employee to perform the duties of other positions, and the physical ability of the employee to return to his/her position (or another available position) after recovery from the injury. In the event the county requires the examination, the county shall be responsible for payments to the physician as required under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.
(3)
Should the employee's physical condition (as determined by the medical evaluation described above or by the workers' compensation physician) warrant, such employee may be assigned by his/her elected official or department director to the duties of another position during the period of recuperation from the injury. The employee may be assigned to duties in another office or department should an appropriate position be unavailable within the employee's office or department. Failure by the employee to accept an "alternative duty" position consistent with his/her limitations shall preclude the employee from receiving 100 percent full salary.
(d)
An eligible employee shall receive 100 percent full salary benefits so long as the employee is unable to return to work and continues to be eligible for benefits under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, provided, however, receipt of 100 percent of full salary for each on-the-job injury shall not exceed 512 hours maximum per injury, not to exceed 512 hours per calendar year for personnel who normally work 40 hours per week, and 696 hours maximum per injury not to exceed 696 hours per calendar year for personnel who normally work a shift of 24 hours.

(2)
Receive benefits provided under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act in lieu of utilizing sick and/or annual leave benefits.
(f)
Should an employee sustain a new on-the-job injury in a subsequent calendar year, the employee shall be entitled to receive 100 percent full salary under the same terms and conditions.
(g)
Any other unclassified civil service employee who is employed in a temporary, or part-time, or seasonal capacity, or is in a probationary status, and who is injured by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment (as defined under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act) shall not receive 100 percent full salary but shall be paid in accordance with provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. Provided however; this section shall not apply to a public safety employee who is presently in a temporary, or part-time, or seasonal capacity, or is presently in a probationary status and who suffers a compensable injury that results from the officer's participation in a life saving event or when an officer suffers or has suffered a violent injury in the line of duty and said public safety employee is not presently receiving 100 percent full salary.
(h)
Effective date of amendment:
(1)
This amendment shall apply to any employee covered under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act who sustains a "new" on-the-job injury on or after the effective date of this amendment and have not already been paid the maximum calendar year benefit as outlined in (d).
(2)
All employees receiving benefits under Rule 5.429 "Leave for injury in line of duty" at the time this amendment becomes effective shall be entitled to the payment of the remainder of their hours, if any, as specified in this section, until such time as the maximum number of hours are paid or the employee returns to work, whichever first occurs.
(i)
In no event shall the provisions of this section affect or compromise the benefits required to be provided pursuant to provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.

For purposes of this section only, "continued service" shall mean consecutive years of employment with the county without any break in service; provided, however, those employees involuntarily terminated for reasons provided in Rule 9.200, "Reductions in Force (Lay Off)," will not be deemed to have a break in service; provided further, only the period of time these employees were employees of the county shall be included in the computation of continued service. The longevity compensation so determined will not be included as salary/wages for purposes of determining future merit or cost-of-living increases; however, it will be included as salary/wages for purposes of county retirement benefits. The level of longevity compensation each employee is eligible to receive will be determined annually by resolution of the board of commissioners depending on, and in accordance with, the availability of funds.

Sec. 70-7. - School leave policy.

Employees eligible for school leave must be either the parent or legal guardian, step-parent, grandparent or step-grandparent of a child enrolled in the county school system. The day and time for taking school leave must be scheduled prior to and approved by the employees' department director/elected official. Employees taking school leave are required to complete a "Certification of School Function Attendance" form immediately upon returning to work in order to receive the appropriate school leave credit.

--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2014-288, § 1, adopted Nov. 18, 2014, repealed former Art. II, §§ 70-61—70-74 in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Art. II pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1973, §§ 2-7½-1—2-7½-3; Ord. No. 00136, § 1, adopted Dec. 5, 2000.

Sec. 70-61. - Declaration of policy.
It is essential to the proper government and administration of the county that the county's officials and employees covered by this article be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial, that public service not be used for private gain, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the county government. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of county officials or employees, the public interest requires that the county protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the officials and employees covered by this article in situations where a conflict may exist. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the county that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards set forth in this article must be interpreted and understood as to not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those best qualified to seek and serve in public office. To that end, the officials and employees noted in this article should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest appears. The policy and purpose of this article, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall apply to the officials and employees noted in this article in the discharge of their official duties, to comport with the object of protecting the integrity of county government, and to prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 70-126. - Statement of policy.
(a)
The county government is firmly committed to providing its employees with a safe work place and promoting high standards of employee health. Consistent with the spirit and intent of this commitment, the board of commissioners has established this policy regarding alcohol and substance abuse. The board of commissioners' goal will continue to be one of establishing and maintaining a work environment that is free from the effects of alcohol and substance abuse.
(b)
County government has several uniquely compelling interests that justify the implementation of procedures for employee alcohol and substance testing. The public has a right to expect that those who have the responsibility of providing services to taxpayers of the county are at all times both physically and mentally prepared to perform their assigned job duties. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of alcohol and certain substances may seriously impair an employee's physical and mental health, and thus, job performance. Where employees participate in alcohol and substance abuse, the integrity of county government and public confidence therein is destroyed.
(c)
Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the county's government and to preserve public trust and confidence, the board of commissioners hereby implements an alcohol and substance abuse policy and testing program to detect prohibited alcohol and substance use by county employees.

Chain of custody means procedures to account for the integrity of each specimen by tracking its handling and storage from point of specimen collection to fine disposition of the specimen. These procedures shall require that an approved agency chain of custody form be used from time of collection or receipt by the laboratory and that upon receipt of the laboratory an appropriate chain of custody form account for the specimen within the laboratory. Chain of custody forms shall, at a minimum, include an entry documenting date and purpose each time a specimen is handled or transferred and identifying every individual in the chain of custody.
Collection site means the medical facility designated by the county (or any alternate site authorized by this division) where individuals present themselves for the purpose of providing a specimen of their blood or urine to be analyzed for the presence of alcohol or substances.
Collection site person means personnel under the direction of the medical facility staff or personnel employed by any alternate collection site authorized by this division, who will instruct and assist individuals at a collection site and who will receive and make an initial examination of the specimen provided by those individuals. A collection site person shall have successfully completed training to carry out this function.
Confirmatory test means a second analytical procedure to identify the presence of a specific substance or metabolite which is independent of the initial test and which uses a different technique and chemical principle from that of the initial test in order to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Alcohol and/or substance testing will be required of job applicants for positions which deal with public safety; or which require or permit the use of motor vehicles or heavy equipment; or which would pose a threat of bodily harm to the applicant; coworkers or the general public if the applicant was impaired. Whether a particular position comes within the meaning of this section will be determined by the personnel director in consultation with the department director (elected official).

Alcohol and/or substance testing will be required of employees for which reasonable suspicion exists to believe that such employees are under the influence of alcohol or substances during assigned working hours or while otherwise on county property. Testing may be required following work-related accidents if the surrounding circumstances give rise to reasonable suspicion to believe that such employees are under the influence of alcohol or substances.
(1)
The initial determination of whether or not reasonable suspicion exists shall be made by the department director (elected official) or by the highest ranking supervisory staff person on duty at the time. The department director (elected official) or supervisory staff person shall consult with the personnel director (or the personnel officer in his absence), when available, for the purpose of determining if an alcohol or substance test is appropriate under the circumstances.
(2)
Following the determination that reasonable suspicion exists and an alcohol or substance test should be administered, the employee shall be immediately transported to the collection site by the employee's department director (elected official) or such designee of the department director (elected official). Following the collection procedure, the person transporting the employee shall make appropriate arrangements to transport the employee home.

Accordingly, when the sheriff, the chief of police or their designees make the determination that reasonable suspicion exists, the employee shall be immediately transported to the collection site as is provided hereinabove.

(6)
After the specimen is collected, it shall be properly sealed and labeled. An approved chain of custody form shall be used for maintaining control and accountability of each specimen from the point of collection to final disposition of the specimen. The date and purpose shall be documented on an approved chain of custody form each time a specimen is handled or transferred and every individual in the chain shall be identified.
(7)
If the collection site is not also the laboratory, the collection site personnel shall arrange to ship the collected specimens to the substance testing laboratory. The specimens shall be placed in containers designed to minimize the possibility of damage during shipment; and those containers shall be securely sealed to eliminate the possibility of undetected tampering. On the tape sealing the containers the collection site supervisor shall sign and enter the date specimens were sealed in the containers for shipment. The collection site personnel shall ensure that the chain of custody documentation is attached to each container sealed for shipment to the substance testing laboratory.
(8)
Only laboratory certified by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA) to perform body fluid tests for substance abuse detection will be used.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-131)
Sec. 70-153. - Laboratory analysis procedures.
The following provisions outline procedures for laboratory analyses:
(1)
Laboratories will use only procedures approved by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA).
(2)
The initial test shall use an immunoassay which meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution.
(3)
All specimens identified as positive on the initial test shall be confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. All confirmations shall be by quantitative analysis. Concentrations exceeding the linear region of the standard curve shall be documented in laboratory records as "greater than highest standard curve value."
(4)
Before any test result is reported (the results of initial tests, confirmatory tests or quality control data), it shall be reviewed and the test certified as an accurate report by the responsible individual. The report shall identify the alcohol/substances/metabolites tested for, whether positive or negative, the specimen number assigned by the collection site person and the substance testing laboratory specimen identification number. The results (positive or negative) for all specimens submitted at the same time to the laboratory shall be reported back to the personnel director.
(5)
The department director (elected official) may request from the personnel director the results of the test.
(6)
The laboratory shall report as negative all specimens which are negative on the initial test or negative on the confirmatory test. Only specimens confirmed positive shall be reported positive for alcohol or a specific substance.
(7)
The personnel director may request from the laboratory and the laboratory shall provide quantitation of test results. The laboratory may transmit results to the personnel director by various electronic means (e.g., teleprinters, facsimile or computer) in a manner designed to ensure confidentiality of the information. Results may not be provided verbally by telephone. The laboratory must ensure the security of the data transmission and limit access to any data transmission, storage and retrieval system.
(8)
The laboratory shall send to the personnel director a certified copy of the original chain of custody form signed by the individual responsible for day-to-day management of the substance testing laboratory or the individual responsible for attesting to the validity of the test reports.
(9)
Because some analyses deteriorate or are lost during freezing and/or storage, quantitation for a retest is not subject to the specific cutoff requirement but must provide data sufficient to confirm the presence of alcohol or the substance or metabolite.
(10)
The laboratory shall have qualified personnel available to testify in an administrative or disciplinary proceeding against an employee when that proceeding is based on positive results reported by the laboratory.
(11)
The provisions provided for in this article shall not limit the county to the usage of only the standard test describe. Tests for other substances and tests by other valid methodologies may be made in particular cases.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-132)
Sec. 70-154. - Quality assurance and quality control.
Alcohol or substance testing laboratories shall have a quality assurance program which encompasses all aspects of the testing process including, but not limited to, specimen acquisition, chain of custody, security and reporting of results, initial and confirmatory testing, and validation of analytical procedures. Quality assurance procedures shall be designed, implemented and reviewed to monitor the conduct of each step of the process of testing for substances.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-133)
Sec. 70-155. - Reporting and review of results.
(a)
Review by personnel director, department director (elected official) and trained medical personnel. The personnel director shall review results in concert with the department director (elected official). An essential part of the substance testing program is the final review of results. A positive test result does not automatically identify an employee/applicant as an unauthorized alcohol or substance user. An individual with a detailed knowledge of possible alternate medical explanations is essential to the review of results. This review shall be performed in collaboration with trained medical personnel.
(b)
Discussion of positive results with individual; assessment of disciplinary action. Prior to making a final decision to verify a positive test result, the personnel director with the department director (elected official), shall give the individual an opportunity to discuss the test results. Following verification of positive test results, and in the absence of an appropriate alternate medical explanation, the department director (elected official) shall assess appropriate disciplinary action against the employee.
(c)
Reanalysis of samples. Should any question arise as to the accuracy or validity of positive test results, the department director (elected official), in consultation with the personnel director, is authorized to order a reanalysis of the original sample and such retests are authorized only at laboratories certified under these guidelines.
(d)
Certification of legitimate substance use. If the laboratory determines there is a legitimate medical explanation for the positive test results, it shall be certified that the results are consistent with authorized substance use and take no further action.
(e)
Action upon determination of scientifically insufficient results. Additionally, the laboratory, based on a review inspection report, quality control data, multiple samples and other pertinent results, may determine that the results are scientifically insufficient for further action and declare the test specimen negative. In this situation, the department director (elected official), in consultation with the personnel director, may require reanalysis of the original sample specimen before making this decision. The reanalysis may be performed by the same laboratory, or a portion of the original specimen may be sent for reanalysis to alternate laboratory. The laboratory shall assist in this review process as requested by making available the individual responsible for day-to-day management of the substance testing laboratory or other employee who is a forensic toxicologist or who has equivalent forensic experience in substance testing to provide specific consultation as required by the county. The laboratory shall report to the personnel director all findings and the scientific basis therefor.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-134)
Sec. 70-156. - Protection of employee records.
The laboratory shall maintain employee records with the highest regard for employee privacy.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-135)
Sec. 70-157. - Individual access to test and laboratory certification results.
Any county employee who is the subject of an alcohol or substance test shall, upon written request, have access to any records relating to his alcohol or substance test.

DIVISION 4. - EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

Sec. 70-171. - Implementation.
The reference point and clearinghouse for the employee assistance program (EAP) will be the county's personnel department. The EAP must have proper resources to interview employees and refer them to appropriate rehabilitation/treatment programs.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-137)
Sec. 70-172. - Confidentiality.
The confidentiality of the records of the employee assistance program (EAP) coordinator will be assured to further promote employee trust and confidence in the EAP. For purposes of statistical reporting, names and dates will not be released. However, the EAP coordinator shall have the obligation to advise the department director (elected official) if such employee admits to be presently impaired. The notion of confidentiality does not give an impaired employee the right to continue working simply because he has accessed the EAP. In such a situation, the department director (elected official) may relieve the employee from work duty, and the employee may seek appropriate leave benefits or some other type of action that will not label the employee as an alcohol or substance abuser.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-138)
Sec. 70-173. - Supervisor referral.
The alcohol and controlled substance abuse policy allows the department director (elected official) to refer an employee to the employee assistance program (EAP) rather than suspend or terminate the employee for a violation of the policy. All referrals to the EAP will be coordinated through the personnel department. After a decision to refer the employee to the EAP has been made, the employee shall be counseled by the department director (elected official) in concert with the personnel director. At this counseling session, the policy shall be reviewed with the employee, and the employee shall sign the "employee consent and notice of referral" form. The counseling session should further provide the opportunity to review the EAP expectations and all other available alternatives to participation in the EAP.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-139)
Sec. 70-174. - Financing.
Subject to approval by the board of commissioners, an outside employee assistance program (EAP) professional organization may be retained as the EAP coordinator. All expenses incident to services rendered by the EAP coordinator shall be the sole responsibility of the employee referred to the EAP. However, the county will cooperate with the employee relative to the filing of appropriate claims with the employee's health insurance provider.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-140)
Sec. 70-175. - Employee's participation.
(a)
If participation in the employee assistance program (EAP) can not be accomplished during nonworking hours, an employee may utilize accumulated sick and annual leave together with any other leave benefits afforded other similarly situated employees.
(b)
Upon their successful completion of the EAP, all employees referred to the EAP will be allowed to return to work with the reinstatement of all seniority rights and privileges previously enjoyed.

ARTICLE V. - SEXUAL HARASSMENT

Sec. 70-196. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to adopt a sexual harassment policy and to provide the procedure within which the objectives of this policy can be accomplished. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidelines of sex discrimination issued by the equal employment opportunity commission, the board of commissioners endorses the following policy.
(Code 1973, § 2-2-15(a))
Sec. 70-197. - Policy statement.
The following provisions shall constitute the county's policy regarding sexual harassment:
(1)
It is illegal and against the policies of the county for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another employee by:
a.
Making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature a condition of an employee's continued employment.
b.
Making submission to or rejections of such conduct the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee.
c.
Discriminating against an employee because of his or her sex.
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
(2)
No person shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that an employee's refusal to submit to sexual advances will adversely affect the employee's employment, evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts or any other condition of employment or career development.
(3)
It is the responsibility of each supervisor, department director and elected official having adopted this policy to maintain the workplace free of sexual harassment. This duty includes discussing this policy with all employees and assuring them that they are not to endure insulting, degrading or exploitive sexual treatment.
(4)
Any employee who believes he or she has been the subject of sexual harassment should report the alleged act immediately to his or her supervisor, department director, elected official or the director of personnel. Any supervisor, department director or elected official who becomes aware of or suspects sexual harassment shall immediately report such information to the director of personnel. Upon receiving a complaint, an investigation shall be undertaken immediately by the department/office in conjunction with the personnel office. Any employee who has been found after appropriate investigation to have sexually harassed another employee will be subject to disciplinary action by his or her department director or elected official from a written warning up to and including termination.
(5)
It is recognized that the question of whether a particular action or incident is a purely personal, social relationship without discriminatory employment effect requires a factual determination based on all facts pertaining to the incident. Given the nature of this type of discrimination, it is further recognized that false accusations of sexual harassment can cause serious effects on innocent women and men. Accordingly, false accusations will result in severe disciplinary action up to and including termination. The county trusts that all employees will continue to act responsibly to establish a pleasant working environment free of sexual harassment.

ARTICLE VIII. - POLITICAL ACTIVITY

Sec. 70-260. - Declaration, purposes, and intent.
It is essential to the proper government and administration of the county that employees covered by this article give the appearance of being independent and impartial with respect to political activities, and that there be public confidence in such employees' neutrality and integrity. The attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private political interests of classified employees and the public responsibilities such employees possess. Therefore, the public welfare requires that the county protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate privileges and prohibitions with respect to the conduct of political activities. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the county that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust or be allowed to support those who will serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the privileges and prohibitions set forth in this article must be interpreted and understood as to not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those who may want to seek public office or support those seeking public office. To that end, employees noted in this article should not, except as otherwise provided herein, be denied the opportunities available to all other citizens with respect to the participation in political activities. The policy and purpose of this article therefore is to make certain those privileges and prohibitions with respect to political activities shall comport with the objective of protecting the integrity of county government, and to prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service.
