Chapter 40 - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Sec. 40-1. - Legislative findings.
new
The county board of commissioners has considered the feasibility of imposing development impact fees and finds, determines, and declares that:
(1)
The state general assembly, through the enactment of the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-71-1—36-71-13, has authorized the county to enact development impact fees;
(2)
The county established a development impact fee advisory committee pursuant to the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-71-5, and that committee has served in an advisory capacity and assisted and advised the county with regard to the development and adoption of this development impact fee ordinance;
(3)
The county comprehensive plan contains within it a capital improvements element which establishes a level of service standard for various capital facilities for the planning horizon to 2042; and the capital improvements element has been submitted to the Northeast Georgia Regional Commission and determined by the state department of community affairs to be in compliance with the rules of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-2, Development Impact Fee Compliance Requirements;
(4)
The county must expand various facilities in order to maintain its level of service standard if new development is to be accommodated without decreasing the adopted standard. This must be done in order to promote and protect the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and the general welfare of the county;
(5)
The imposition of development impact fees is a preferred method of ensuring the availability of capital facilities necessary to accommodate new development;
(6)
The type of land development described in article II hereof, will create demand for the acquisition of park and open space land and the construction of capital facilities;
(7)
The fees established by article II are derived from, are based upon, and do not exceed a proportionate share of the costs of providing additional facilities necessitated by the new land developments for which the fees are levied; and
(8)
The report entitled "A Report on Impact Fees Prepared for Jackson County, Georgia," dated April 8, 2022, sets forth a reasonable methodology and analysis for the determination of the development impact of new development on the need for and costs for additional facilities in the county for which the fees are levied.

Applicant is a person applying for the issuance of a building permit.
Building permit is the approval issued by the county that authorizes the construction or permanent placement of a building, dwelling or other structure on a site.
Capital equipment is buildings and other improvements which increase the service capacity of a public facility all with an expected use life of ten years or more.
Capital improvement includes planning, land acquisition, site improvements, and capital equipment, but excludes maintenance and operation.
Developer means any person or legal entity undertaking development.
Development means any construction or expansion of a building, structure, or use, any change in use of a building or structure, or any change in the use of land, any of which creates additional demand and need for park and recreation facilities.
Development approval means any written authorization from the county which authorizes the commencement of construction.
Development impact fee means a payment of money imposed upon development as a condition of development approval to pay for a proportionate share of the cost of certain specified system improvements needed to serve new growth and development.
Encumber means to legally obligate by contract or otherwise commit to use by appropriation or other official act of the county.
Feepayor means that person who pays a development impact fee or his/her successor in interest. In the absence of any express transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to any refund of previously paid development impact fees, the right or entitlement shall be deemed "not to run with the land."
Floor area shall have the same meaning as in the International Building Code.
Impact fee administrator shall mean the county director of public development or designee.
Living area shall have the same meaning as in the International Building Code.
Present value means the current value of past, present, or future payments, contributions or dedications of goods, services, materials, construction, or money.
Private park and/or recreational facility is an area which is not owned by or dedicated to any governmental entity and is an area designed and equipped for sports and leisure activities but does not include areas not readily accessible to all residents of the county for such activities.
Project means a particular development on an identified parcel of land.
Project improvements means site improvements and facilities that are planned and designed to provide service for a particular development project and that are necessary for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the project and are not system improvements. The character of the improvement shall control a determination of whether an improvement is a project improvement or system improvement and the physical location of the improvement on-site or off-site shall not be considered determinative of whether an improvement is a project improvement or a system improvement. If an improvement or facility provides or will provide more than incidental service or facilities capacity to persons other than users or occupants of a particular project, the improvement or facility is a system improvement and shall not be considered a project improvement. No improvement or facility included in a plan for public facilities approved by the governing body of the county shall be considered a project improvement.
Proportionate share means that portion of the cost of system improvements which is reasonably related to the service demands and needs of the project.
Service area means a geographic area defined by the county in which a defined set of public facilities provide service to development within the area. Service areas shall be designated on the basis of sound planning or engineering principles or both.
System improvement costs means cost incurred to provide additional public facilities capacity needed to serve growth and development for planning, design and construction, land acquisition, land improvement, design and engineering related thereto, including the cost of constructing or reconstructing system improvements or facility expansions, including but not limited to the construction contract price, surveying and engineering fees, related land acquisition costs (including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorneys' fees, and expert witness fees), and expenses incurred for qualified staff or any qualified engineer, planner, architect, landscape architect, or financial consultant for preparing or updating the capital improvement element, and administrative costs, provided that such administrative costs shall not exceed three percent of the total amount of development impact fee receipts. Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included if the development impact fees are to be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes, or other financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the municipality or county to finance the capital improvements element but such costs do not include routine and periodic maintenance expenditures, personnel training, and other operating costs.
System improvements means capital improvements that are public facilities and are designed to provide service to the community at large, in contrast to "project improvements." No improvement or facility shall be considered a system improvement unless it is included in a plan for public facilities approved by the governing body of the county.
Impact fee administrator means the county director of public development or other municipal official designated to carry out the administration of this chapter.

ARTICLE II. - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES IMPOSED

Sec. 40-21. - Imposition of development impact fees.
new
(a)
Fees. Any person who, after the effective date of this chapter, seeks to develop land within the county by applying for a building permit is hereby required to pay the following development impact fees in the manner and amount set forth in this chapter.
(1)
Public safety—Emergency medical services (EMS);
(2)
Public safety—Emergency management agency/91l;
(3)
Park and open space land acquisition; and
(4)
Roads.
(b)
Fee payment before permit issuance. No building permit for any activity requiring payment of a development impact fee pursuant to this article shall be issued unless and until all applicable development impact fees hereby required have been paid.
(c)
Uses. The impact fee administrator shall determine which of the impact fees for land use(s) set forth in this chapter applies to a given application for building permit. The impact fee administrator shall be guided in such determinations by the use definitions and applicable use permissions of the Jackson County Unified Development Code.
(d)
Mixed uses. If a building permit is requested for mixed uses, then the fee shall be determined through using the schedule of fees provided in this article by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the schedule.
(e)
Change, expansion or modification of use. In the case of change of use, redevelopment, or expansion or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit, the development impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in the development impact fee for the new use as compared to the previous use.
(f)
Shell buildings. Builders may apply for a building permit to construct the "shell" of a building. Tenant finish permits are issued later to finish construction of the interior of the building. The impact fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of the building permit for construction of the shell. The amount of the fee shall be based on the intended land use as described by the builder. If a builder applies for a "shell" permit and the intended land use is not known, the impact fees shall be assessed based on that land use which generates the greatest impact and is allowed under the existing zoning for the lot or parcel. If it is found during review of the application for a tenant finish permit that the actual land use differs from the intended land use as described by the builder, a determination shall be made as to whether or not an additional impact fee is due. If so, the additional impact fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a new building permit for the completion of the shell. If it is determined that there has been an over-payment of impact fees, a refund would become available pursuant to article IV of this chapter. If a shell permit was issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and left unfinished, impact fees shall be assessed for tenant finish permits within that shell, based on the land use proposed in each tenant finish permit. Subsequent change of use, redevelopment, or modification of the structure may be subject to an impact fee as determined by the impact fee administrator.
(g)
Accessory residential structures. Generally, no impact fee shall be assessed for a use that is accessory to residential development, as interpreted by the impact fee administrator based on use permissions in the Jackson County Unified Development Code, such as a clubhouse or tennis court in an apartment complex or a guest house on the lot of a detached dwelling, if it can be established to the satisfaction of the impact fee administrator that the structure will not result in any additional residents, visitors, building occupants, customers or employees.
(h)
Model homes. Model homes on residentially zoned land shall be assessed impact fees.

If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is not presented, the applicant shall pay development impact fees based upon the schedules specified in this article. If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is presented, the impact fee administrator may adjust the fee to that appropriate to the particular development. Determinations made by the impact fee administrator pursuant to this paragraph may be appealed to the county board of commissioners by filing a written request with the county clerk within ten days of the impact fee administrator's determination.
