Street rights-of-way shall not be considered a part of a front yard setback for the purpose of meeting the minimum requirements of this UDC.
Story: That portion of a building comprised between a floor and the floor or roof next above. The first floor of a two- or multi-story building shall be deemed the story that has no floor immediately below it that is designed for living quarters or for human occupancy.

Yard, front: A yard situated along any public street right-of-way or private street or access easement. In the case of a double frontage lot, if there is an established no access easement along one of the frontages, the yard adjacent to the no access easement shall not be considered a front yard for purposes of this UDC.
Yard, rear: A yard situated along a rear lot line.
Yard, side: A yard situated along a side lot line, but not extending into a front or rear yard.

Sec. 116. - Lot width.
A minimum lot width requirement helps prevent irregular, oddly shaped lots, assures sufficient side yards between the structure that might be erected on the lot and the lot line, confers privacy and space for recreation by providing distance between houses or buildings on adjacent lots, and permits access of light and air to the building or structures on the lot.

Nonconforming lot: A lot which does not conform to the lot requirements of the zoning district or if applicable overlay district in which the lot is located as established by this UDC but which was a lot of record prior to the effective date of this UDC or its amendment. A lot created pursuant to an act of subdivision of land which was unlawful shall not be considered a nonconforming lot.
Nonconforming situation: Any development, land improvement, or activity, not otherwise included within the definition of nonconforming lot, nonconforming building or structure, or nonconforming use, which does not meet the provisions of this UDC at the time of its adoption or amendment.
