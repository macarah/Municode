The distance shall not include any acceleration or deceleration lanes or turning radii. The width shall be:
(1)
Fourteen (14) feet per lane (exclusive of any medians) if from a non-residential or multifamily residential use onto any type of street, and
(2)
Twenty-four (24) feet total if from a residential major subdivision onto any type of street.
(3)
Twelve (12) feet for an individual residential driveway onto a local street and fourteen (14) feet for one and two-family residential driveways onto arterial or collector streets.
ii)
Design and Construction of the Parking Lot Entrance Drive. For every new or converted multi-family, commercial, industrial and quasi-public use, the following standards shall apply:
(1)
Length of entrance drive to be kept free of parking maneuvers (backing up, three-point turns, initial parking) shall meet the requirements of Table 7.5: Parking Lot Drive Length.
(2)
Each ingress or egress aisle/driveway shall have a minimum width as identified in Table 7.1: Parking Dimensions, dependent on the angle of parking. Each aisle/driveway shall be so designed so as to provide for adequate turning and maneuvering. Each ingress or egress aisle/driveway shall be improved with hard, dust free surface materials (excluding gravel) from the street apron to the entrance of the parking area.
(3)
There shall be no more than two (2) access ways providing for ingress or egress on any one street unless for good cause shown and approved by the City Engineer.
(4)
Ingress and egress driveways shall not be used to meet the requirements of Table 7.3: Minimum Parking Space Requirements as stated in this Section and thereby block the reasonable flow of vehicles to parking spaces. Parking arrangements within ingress and egress driveway areas shall be approved by the Planning & Zoning Commission.
iii)
Travel Direction. The direction of travel for vehicles using entrances shall be as follows:
(1)
All entrances providing access to a public right-of-way from all lots used for nonresidential or multifamily development shall be designed so that vehicles are traveling in a forward direction when entering and leaving.

(3)
Requirements for Development Plans. All applications for a Land Disturbance Permit or Development Plan Review that will require removal of protected trees shall include a protected tree plan or indicate on the demolition, grading and landscape plans the following:
(a)
A scale map or a plot plan showing the proposed development and noting the location of all protected trees. Tree stands may be outlined giving species and category of trees.
(b)
Notations regarding which protected trees are to be removed, replaced, or are requested to be counted toward landscaping requirements.
(c)
Methods of protection.
g)
Measurement Standards . All new trees required to be planted by this Ordinance shall be measured as follows:
i)
All broadleaf/deciduous trees shall be two and one-half (2½) inches in diameter (DBH- Diameter at Breast Height) at the time of planting, measured at six (6) inches above the root ball.
ii)
All evergreen conifers shall be four (4) feet in height at the time of planting, measured from the top of the root ball.
iii)
All shrubs shall be twenty-four (24) inches in height at the time of planting, measured from ground level.

Assurance of Installation/Completion . Plant material used for buffer yards, medians, entrances, ponds, or street or subdivision perimeter landscaping shall be designated as "Common Area" or as a landscape easement on the landscape plan(s), and shall be installed prior to the recording of the plat of the subdivision. A final Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued until all landscaping shown on the landscape plan has been installed. A temporary Certificate of Occupancy may be issued for the property for a period of up to six (6) months as weather conditions permit landscape installation, provided that the developer shall submit a financial guarantee in the amount of one-hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the installed cost of landscaping when planting has to be delayed.
i)
Bonding . The applicant shall also have the option of posting a bond equal to one-hundred fifty percent (150%) of the material and installation costs identified on the plan if the installation of buffer yard and landscaping materials are to be completed at the end of a project. This bond will permit the City to contract the installation of the approved landscape plan, with the applicant's landscape contractor, at the required "prevailing wage rate" should the applicant fail to install the landscape plan within one (1) complete growing season. The "Prevailing wage rate" is the rate at which the City must pay a contractor to provide services for the City. If the applicant desires bonding, the applicant shall revise the cost annually to account for increases in costs of labor and materials.
j)
Utility Easement Conflicts . Required plant material shall be located in areas exclusive of drainage and utility easements and overhead utilities. Plant material shall not be placed in the road/street right-of-way without permission from the City Engineer.

10)
WASTE CONTAINERS/RECYCLING CONTAINERS/SERVICE STRUCTURES SCREENING REQUIREMENTS. With the exception of single-family residential districts, no owner, tenant or occupant of any lot in any district may store, place, or keep, or permit to be stored, placed or kept on that lot, any combination of dumpsters, compactors, grease dumpsters or any other waste or garbage containers (hereinafter referred to as "containers"), that exceed a total of one-hundred twenty (120) gallons in capacity, outside an enclosed building, except for collection purposes as is otherwise permitted in this Ordinance, unless the following conditions are met.
a)
The containers shall be located on a concrete pad that is enclosed by a three-sided structure constructed of masonry construction or wood sufficient to provide complete visual screening of the containers to a height of twelve (12) inches above the top of the containers. The unit shall be constructed with materials similar to the principal structure. The structures shall not be located closer than twenty (20) feet from any dwelling on an adjacent residential lot. The structure shall not project into or be located on a front or side yard. It may be located in a rear yard but shall be not less than five (5) feet from any rear or side lot lines. On corner lots the enclosure can sit no closer to the street than the building itself.
b)
Any service structure that can be seen from the first floor of a residence or from any street shall be screened. Structures may be grouped together; however, screening height requirements shall be based upon the tallest of the structures. "Service Structures" shall include, but not be limited to: loading docks, propane tanks, dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults which extend above ground, ground-mounted utility equipment and any electrical or other equipment or elements providing service to a building or a site.
i)
Location of screening. There shall be a continuous planting, hedge, fence or wall of earth, having one-hundred percent (100%) opacity, which would enclose any service structure on all sides, unless such structures must be frequently moved or accessed, in which case screening on all but one side is required. The average height of the screening material shall be six (6) feet or one (1) foot greater than the height of the enclosed structure, whichever is greater, but shall not, in any case, be required to exceed ten (10) feet in height.
(1)
Whenever a service structure is located next to a building wall, perimeter landscaping material, or off-street parking area landscaping material, such walls or screening material may fulfill the screening requirement set out in Subsection 7.05(6). Whenever service structures are screened by plant material, such material may count towards the fulfillment of required interior or perimeter landscaping. Whenever a service structure is screened by a wall or fence, such wall or fence shall be constructed of the same materials as the building which it services.
ii)
Curbs to protect screening material. Whenever screening material is placed around any dumpster or waste collection unit which is emptied or removed mechanically on a regularly occurring basis, a curb to contain the placement of the container shall be provided within the screening material on those sides where there is such material. The curbing shall be at least one (1) foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent possible damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied.
c)

11)
MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT BUFFERING STANDARDS. Mechanical equipment materials and buffering standards applicable to the multifamily residential and nonresidential zoning districts:
a)
Ground Level . All outdoor storage areas for completed products manufactured on-site, production materials, building-mounted utilities, outdoor refrigeration units and mechanical equipment located on the ground shall be screened consistent with the following requirements. In no instance shall this be interpreted as applying to merchandise for sale that is temporarily or seasonally placed outdoors.
i)
Fencing. A minimum six (6) feet tall, one-hundred percent (100%) opaque fence of wood, brick, or stone construction shall completely screen the area from the view of public streets and adjacent properties. Opaque six (6) feet tall gates shall be provided to access the facility. The gates shall generally remain closed, except when immediate access to the area is required.
ii)
Landscape Screening. Evergreen planting shall be provided around the exterior perimeter of the required fencing.
(1)
Evergreen shrubs shall be a minimum of two (2) feet tall at the time of planting, and planted at a maximum of three (3) feet on center. Wider spacing may be permitted depending on the species and upon approval of the Director.
b)
Roof-mounted . All roof-top equipment, such as HVAC units, shall be screened from the view of all public streets by parapets, dormers, or other screens. The material of all such screens shall be consistent with the exterior materials used on the facade of the structure.
12)
BUFFER YARD REQUIREMENTS. The following requirements shall pertain to buffering a new use from an existing adjacent use or district as described below. The purpose of these buffering and screening standards is to lessen the potential conflicts between the possible uses in one zoning district and those uses in adjacent districts through the use of setbacks and landscaping. The potential degree of conflict between the uses determines the extent of the buffer required.
a)
Applicability .
i)
Screening areas shall be provided for the purpose of minimizing the friction between incompatible land uses and improving the aesthetic and functional quality of new development;
ii)
Where vegetative and/or topographic conditions that provide a natural screening and buffer exist prior to development of properties in question, every effort shall be made to retain such conditions. In such cases, additional screening may not be required, provided that provision is made for maintenance of such areas; and
iii)
The Planning & Zoning Commission may waive the requirement for a wall, fence or greenbelt if equivalent screening is provided by existing or planned parks, parkways, and recreation areas or by topography or other natural conditions.
b)
Buffer Yard Standards . The buffer yard standards only apply along the property lines where the two dissimilar uses or zoning classifications meet as specified in Table 7.8: Applicable Buffer Yard Types. The required buffer yards shall be installed despite the presence of streets, alleys, and other features. Existing mature vegetation may be credited towards required buffering. When a dissimilar land use locates next to an established residential land use within the same zoning classification, buffering and screening standards per Table 7.9: Buffer Yard Types Description for Buffer Yard Type 2 shall apply.
i)
Responsibility. The developer or owner of the property being developed or otherwise changed in use is responsible for installing the buffer yard at the time of that development or change. The adjacent property owner shall not have to participate in installing the buffer yard.
ii)
Buffer Yard Location. All required buffer yard areas shall be provided entirely on the subject property and shall be in addition to setbacks required by this Ordinance.
iii)
Planting Location. Required buffer yard trees may be placed either at regular intervals or in irregular patterns representing a natural landscape. However, no two (2) buffer yard trees (excluding evergreen trees) shall be placed closer than twenty (20) feet to one another. No buffer yard or required landscape materials shall be placed within any easement, right-of-way, or septic field.
iv)
Tree Size. All broadleaf/deciduous trees must have at least a two and one-half (2½) inch caliper measured at six (6) inches above the top of the rootball, and all evergreen conifers must be a minimum of four (4) feet in height measured from the top of the rootball when planted.
v)
Ground Cover. All portions of the buffer yard not planted with trees, shrubs or other landscaped materials shall be covered with grass or other ground-covering vegetation. Landscaping stone or other non-vegetative surfaces may not be substituted for ground-covering vegetation unless otherwise approved by the Director.
vi)
Application. No landscaping required by this Section may be used to satisfy the minimum requirements of any other provisions of this Ordinance unless approved by the Director.
vii)
Maintenance. All landscape materials must be properly maintained, and kept in a neat and orderly appearance, free from all debris and refuse.
(1)
All plant material which is unhealthy or dead, in the opinion of the Community Development Director, shall be replaced by the end of the next spring or fall planting season.
(2)
Landscape materials are intended to grow, spread and mature over time. Pruning, limbing-up, topping and other growth-inhibiting measures may only be used to ensure the public safety and/or health of the vegetation.
c)
Buffer Yard Widths . The buffer yard requirement shall not be included as part of the minimum setback requirements unless approved by the Director. Plant material shall be selected from Tables 7.13 - 7.20 unless approved by the Director.
13)
MODIFICATION. The Planning & Zoning Commission shall have the authority to modify any of the requirements of this Section in accordance with Subsection 2.02(9)(a) ix.

TREE DENSITY REQUIREMENTS
a)
Use of tree units . The landscaping requirements of this Article regarding the preservation or planting of trees is expressed in terms of "tree units" rather than the number of trees or tree canopy. This approach provides the applicant with wide latitude of choice as to the number and sizes of trees to be planted, and their distribution following aesthetic landscaping practices, while achieving a common standard on all properties.
b)
Establishment of tree unit values . The diameter of a tree's trunk establishes the "tree unit" value of an existing tree, as shown on Table 7.10: Unit Value of Landscape Material, or for a newly planted tree as shown on Table 7.11: Tree Units for Existing Trees.
i)
The values assigned to trees of the same size are different for existing and new trees, as indicated in the table. One "unit" is not the same as one "tree."
ii)
Actual tree diameters or calipers are to be rounded to the nearest whole number for the calculation of tree unit values (e.g., 4.5 inches in diameter = 5 inches).

All trees that are outside the formal tree protection zone(s) as outlined in the Tree Protection and Replacement Plan and are equal to or greater than twelve (12) inches DBH, and are in areas where construction will occur inside the crown of the tree shall be required to have an enhanced protection program. In order to maximize the ability of the selected trees to survive construction the proposed program will include the following steps.
i)
The tree will be surveyed and located with the species and DBH noted and approximate crown diameter shown.
ii)
Prior to the beginning of construction activities, the trees shall be inspected by a City Approved Arborist to determine their overall condition and ability to withstand construction activity around them.
iii)
Should the City Approved Arborist determine that with a proper protection plan the tree would survive the construction activity the Arborist shall prepare a care plan for the tree. The plan may involve elements such as crown pruning, fertilization, irrigation, root pruning or other activities.
iv)
The Contractor will be required to implement the Arborist's protection plan and to maintain the necessary activities to protect the tree until such time as the site construction is completed and accepted for maintenance by the property owner. The City Approved Arborist shall submit bi-weekly reports to the Contractor and the Department of Community Development during the construction process.
v)
The owner of the property shall receive a twenty (20%) percent bonus credit for canopy coverage for all trees that are under the enhanced protection program.
vi)
No land disturbing activity or construction activity, including, but not limited to, grading, digging, soil disturbance or other activity within the critical root zone of any boundary tree, is permitted that will deprive the boundary tree of continued viability as determined by a certified arborist.

(3)
CRZ/TPZ twenty (20%) percent — thirty-three (33%) percent impact and structural root plate has impact/not protected.
viii)
The builder/developer/construction site property owner must submit a boundary tree agreement signed by the tree owner/co-owner and notarized giving permission for the tree that has construction impact to be treated or removed (see Community Development Department for the city boundary tree agreement). The minimum time length of the boundary tree agreement shall be three (3) years. The receipt for the paid arboricultural prescription and signed agreement will need to be submitted with the plans for review.
(1)
The builder/developer/construction site owner must make at least three attempts to contact the owner of the boundary tree to enact a boundary tree agreement. The first two attempts may be in person or via telephone. The third attempt must be in the form of a written letter sent certified, return receipt requested to the property owner's address of record in the Carroll or Douglas County Tax Database. If there is no response to any of the attempts, the builder/developer/construction site owner shall provide evidence to the city of the attempts at contact in addition to the arboriculture prescription for the affected tree.
(2)
If no boundary tree agreement is reached, the affected tree shall not be removed but shall be protected during development based on this Chapter and in accordance with the arboriculture prescription.
(3)
A boundary tree bond or escrow account may be required based on the arboricultural prescription depending on the impact to a boundary tree covered under a boundary tree agreement.
(4)
A boundary tree bond or escrow account shall be required where a boundary tree agreement cannot be reached.
(5)
A boundary tree bond or escrow shall be one-hundred and twenty-five (125%) percent of the cost of removal and replacement of the tree(s) affected and will be held for three years by the city. The property owner of the affected tree(s) may apply to the city for the escrow funds to remove and replace the tree(s) during the three-year escrow period. If the boundary tree(s) is/are deemed healthy at the end of the three-year period by an Arborist, the developer may apply to the City for a refund of the original amount of escrow.
(6)
The site/landscape plans cannot be approved without signed boundary tree agreement(s) or proof of attempts to contact the boundary tree owner in an attempt to reach a boundary tree agreement in addition to an arboriculture prescription where needed.
7)
SEASONAL PLANTING.
Final plat approval or a certificate of occupancy may be issued prior to the establishment of trees planned to meet the tree canopy cover requirements, if the Community Development Director or their designee determines that the season is inappropriate for planting. In such cases the trees shall be planted by the last day of February following the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final plat approval. If they have not been planted by the last day of February following the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final plat approval, the permit holder shall be considered to be in violation of the provisions of this article.
8)
TREE BANK
The intent of the requirements of this Section is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/ or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The Tree Bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the Director before the Tree Bank may be used. The Tree Bank provides two options, which are described in full below.
a)
Option One, Planting Trees Off-site .
i)
Install an equal amount of required Tree Density Units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case the following criteria shall be observed:
ii)
The technical Advisory Committee has identified alternate "Option One" sites. The Villa Rica Community Development Department has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the Tree Bank. Persons wishing to use Option One should consult with the Zoning Administrator to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the Zoning Administrator with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited.
iii)
The developer shall submit a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be two (2) caliper inches at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required each tree must be three (3) caliper inches at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan.
iv)
If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that the owner agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan.
v)
Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one-year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition.
b)
Option Two, Monetary Compensation for Trees .
i)
A developer may choose to provide the City with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed:
ii)
Provide tree density calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Show the total amount of Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site.
iii)
Multiply the Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site by the Monetary Compensation Value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Contact City approved certified arborist or landscape architect for the current Monetary Compensation Value.
iv)
Provide a certified check made payable to the City of Villa Rica in the amount of the product as listed in item ii. above and as provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Submit the certified check to a Community Development Director or designee along with a copy of the approved Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan.
v)
The monies collected for the Tree Bank Option Two may be used by the City for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, libraries, and other similar community facilities. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the Director.
c)
Standards for Administering these Alternative Compliance Methods .
i)
The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement. The site development permit shall be issued after the Director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds.
d)
Exclusions .
i)
Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the Tree Bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum Tree Density Units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the Tree Bank in accordance with Option One or Option Two above.
Sec. 7.07. - Redevelopment sites.
1)
For redeveloped sites the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends the developer, authorized registered professionals, design professionals and staff schedule a pre-submittal meeting with the department to discuss the potential of the site and any issues that may be present on the site.
2)
Redeveloped sites shall comply with the buffer and specimen tree requirements as set forth in this Ordinance and provide compliance with parking lot, landscape strip and Tree Density Unit requirements.
3)
Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of twenty-five percent (≤25%) percent or greater of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall include the existing and proposed landscape conditions that verify compliance with this Ordinance.
a.
At a minimum the plan must show the following existing and proposed elements with intent to comply:
i.
Buffers.
ii.
Landscape strips.
iii.
Parking lot trees.
iv.
Tree Density Units.
v.
Tree Save Areas.
b.
Director shall review the proposed Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan.
