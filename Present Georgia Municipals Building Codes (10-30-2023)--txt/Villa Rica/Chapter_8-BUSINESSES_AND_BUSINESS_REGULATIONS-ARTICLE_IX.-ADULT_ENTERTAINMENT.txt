ARTICLE IX. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 8-257. - Adult entertainment establishments; findings; public purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed.
(b)
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Troup County, Georgia; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Austin, and Amarillo, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before us, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among communities within our country.
(c)
Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment", leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
(d)
Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are: disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use, and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are: depression of property values, acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described.
(e)
Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general.
(f)
Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses, to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts, and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas.
(g)
Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment establishments to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses.
(h)
While it is recognized that such regulation as is established by this article cannot de facto approach prohibition as a protected form of expression would vanish, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
(i)
To that end, the ordinance from which this article is derived is hereby adopted.
