PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT ESTABLISHED. The PUD District is hereby established. This Ordinance allows for any zoning district(s) to be rezoned for the creation of a PUD. All PUDs shall be consistent with the requirements of Chapter VI: Planned Unit Developments.
3)
SUBDIVISION OF LAND. The subdivision of land in every zoning district shall be consistent with the provision and requirement of the City of Villa Rica Subdivision Control ordinance, as amended.
Sec. 4.02. - Zoning district transition.
1)
The zoning districts, as established by this Ordinance, differ from previously established zoning districts in the City of Villa Rica Zoning Ordinance dated 2006. Each of the districts has either been combined with other districts, removed, remains the same, or is a newly added district. Table 4.1: Agricultural and Residential Transitional Districts and Table 4.2: Non-Residential/Nonagricultural Transitional Districts shall apply for all district interpretations regarding previously and newly established zoning districts.
Sec. 4.03. - Permitted and special exception uses.
1)
PERMITTED AND SPECIAL EXCEPTION USE TABLE.
a)
Within Table 4.3: Permitted and Special Exception Land Uses, specific uses located in the left column are designated as either Permitted Uses, Permitted with Conditions, and Permitted by Special Exception (Conditional Use). If there is no designation, the use is not permitted within that district.
b)
A Development Plan may be required as per Section 11.03 - Development Plan Review and Approval.
2)
USE CLASSIFICATIONS.
a)
Permitted uses . Permitted uses are those uses allowed without special permission of the Villa Rica City Council, given that they follow the standards and requirements set forth in this Ordinance.
b)
Special Exceptions . Special Exceptions are those uses that, because of potential incompatibility and negative impact on surrounding land uses, require additional review in order to determine compliance with City of Villa Rica standards and to determine their suitability in a given location. In order to achieve balance between the public benefit and the local impact, Special Exceptions are only permitted following a public hearing and approval by the Villa Rica City Council, as per Section 2.04 - Villa Rica City Council and Section 11.09 - Special Exception Procedure.
c)
Unlisted or Questionable Land Uses . Any use listed within Section 4.03 - Permitted and Special Exception uses but not designated as either permitted or Special Exception within a specific zoning district on the table shall be not permitted within the specific zoning district. If a use is not listed on the table, the requirements of the most similar use may be imposed according to a determination by the Director. This determination may be appealed to the Villa Rica City Council consistent with the provisions of Section 11.11 - Administrative Appeals Procedure for Administrative Appeal Applications.
3)
USES PERMITTED PER LOT. Only one (1) principal use (whether a permitted or Special Exception use) of a lot shall be permitted. All other uses occurring on a lot shall be accessory to or a subordinate component of the principal use (e.g. a shopping center would be considered the principal use).
4)
ACCESSORY USES. Accessory uses and structures shall be incidental to, and commonly associated with the operation of, the principal use of the lot. Accessory use standards and requirements are listed in Sec. 8.02 - Accessory Structure and Use Standards.

Sec. 4.04. - Lot standards.
1)
PURPOSE. Lot Standards for each district dictate the minimum and/or maximum standards that apply to lots within certain zoning districts. These regulations for property developed within City of Villa Rica's jurisdiction are shown on Table 4.4: Residential Lot Standards and Table 4.5: Non-Residential Lot Standards.
2)
INTERPRETING THE LOT STANDARDS TABLES. The following explanations of terms should be consulted when interpreting Table 4.4: Residential Lot Standards and Table 4.5: Non-Residential Lot Standards. For more information on the meaning of terms in this Ordinance, see Chapter XIII: Definitions.
a)
Minimum Lot Size . The smallest area established by this Ordinance on which a use, structure or building may be located in a particular district and which does not include any street right-of-way.
b)
Minimum Lot Width . This refers to the minimum width a lot must have in order to be considered developable by this Ordinance. The minimum lot width is the minimum allowable horizontal distance between the side property lines of a lot measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the front lot line at the front setback line. Lot width on cul-de-sac lots and other lots with curving frontages is measured as a line parallel to the frontage and at the front setback line.
c)
Minimum Lot Frontage . The frontage of a lot shall be construed to be the portion nearest the street. For the purpose of determining setback requirements on corner lots and through lots, all sides of a lot adjacent to streets shall be considered frontages. The minimum length of a lot frontage shall be measured between side lot lines at the street right-of-way or private street easement. Lots that have more than one frontage may combine the width of both frontages to meet the minimum lot frontage standard.
d)
Maximum Building Height . The maximum allowable vertical distance of a building or structure. Building height shall be defined as the vertical distance as measured from the average elevation of the proposed finished grade at the front of the building to the highest point of the roof for flat roofs, to the deck line of mansard roofs, and the mean height between eaves and ridge for gable, hip and gambrel roofs. Certain height exceptions are permitted according to the provisions of Section 7.07 - Height Standards.
i)
Exceptions to height limits. The height limitations of this Chapter shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, observation towers, transmission towers, chimneys, smokestacks, conveyors, flagpoles, masts and aerials.
e)
Minimum Building Lines .
i)
The minimum yards (setbacks) for all structures shall be established in Chapter IV, Table 4.4 and Table 4.5 in the Villa Rica Zoning Ordinance subject to the following requirements:
ii)
Permitted Encroachments into Yards. The following encroachments shall be allowed to the extent specified below.
iii)
Non-residential. Canopies and awnings shall be allowed over walkways or driveways to within twelve (12) feet of the street right-of-way or the right-of-way based on the street's functional classification, whichever is farther from the street's centerline. Fuel pumps and pump islands, when permitted, shall be setback as stated in this paragraph for canopies.
iv)
Single-family residential and townhouses used for single family on individual lots of record. Porches, decks or patios attached to the main dwelling may extend no more than ten feet into a minimum front or rear yard. Outdoor fireplaces and outdoor uncovered kitchens, whether stand alone or constructed as a part of a patio, retaining wall or other structure, may only be located in the rear yard and may extend no more than ten (10) feet into the minimum rear yard. In no case shall an outdoor fireplace be located closer than ten (10) feet to a property line. Awnings may project to within five feet of a side lot line.
v)
All zoning districts. Architectural features such as cornices, eaves, steps, stoops, gutters, fire chases, chimneys which are a part of an exterior wall of the primary structure, and fire escapes may not encroach or project over more than thirty-six (36) inches (3 feet) into any minimum yard. Wheelchair ramps and associated walkways shall be exempt from these requirements.
vi)
Adjoining railroads. There shall be no minimum rear yard requirement adjoining the siding for those uses which utilize a rail siding for loading and unloading.
vii)
Building Lot Lines (setbacks).
(1)
Front Setback. The horizontal space between the Front lot line and the Front Setback line, extending to the side lines of the lot, generally parallel with and measured from the front lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be located above ground, except as may be provided in this Ordinance. The front setback applies to all frontages of a lot facing a street or right-of-way.
(2)
Side Setback. The horizontal space between the side lot lines and the side setback lines, extending to the front and rear lot lines, generally parallel with and measured from each side lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be located above ground, except as may be provided in this Ordinance. However, for corner and through lots, any side of a structure that faces a street shall meet front setback requirements.
(3)
Rear Setback. The horizontal space between the rear lot line and the rear setback line, extending to the side lines of the lot, generally parallel with and measured from the rear lot line, defining the area in which no building or structure may be located above ground, except as may be provided in this Ordinance. For through lots, the rear of the structure facing a street shall meet front setback requirements. rear Setbacks for Corner lots will apply to the portion of the lot that is furthest in the opposite direction of the general orientation of the structure.
viii)
Corner lots. Principal structures on corner lots shall be required to identify a main entrance. Said entrance shall be setback as specified in the front yard setback regulations for the applicable zoning district. The setback for the other street-adjoining side shall be as specified in the district regulations.
f)
Front Setbacks and Roadway Classifications .
i)
Front Yard Setbacks are intended to establish a visual buffer distinguishing the building line from the roadway. Based on the traffic volume and roadway width, whether in a rural or urban setting, building setbacks are varied according to the road classification, with greater setbacks on larger streets with higher volume traffic, and lesser setbacks on smaller less travelled streets.
ii)
Roadways are grouped into functional classes according to the character of traffic they are intended to serve. They may also be further classified as rural or urban based on the population surrounding a particular roadway. There are four highway functional classifications: expressway/freeway, arterial, collector, and local roads, and these can be defined as:
(1)
Interstate - Provides the highest level of service at the greatest speed for the longest uninterrupted distance, with some degree of access control.
(2)
Arterial - Provides the next highest level of service at moderate to high speeds, with some degree of access control. Arterials are typically classified as major arterial and minor arterial.
(3)
Collector - Provides a lower level of service at a lower speed for shorter distances by collecting traffic from local roads and connecting them with arterials. Collectors are also classified as major and minor collectors.
(4)
Local - Consists of all roads not defined as arterials or collectors; primarily provides access to land with little or minimal "through" movement.
Figure 4.1: City of Villa Rica Roadway Functional Classification
g)
Minimum Distance Between Structures on Same lot . This distance, measured between the points of shortest distance on the exterior facades of two (2) structures, shall determine the minimum separation of multiple structures within one (1) developed lot.
h)
Minimum Ground Floor Living Area (Per unit) . The sum of the livable horizontal areas on the ground level of a building measured from the interior faces of the exterior walls, exclusive of basements, unfinished attics and attached garages. The minimum for a specific residential structure shall be dependent on the number of stories within the residential structure.
i)
Total Minimum Living Area (Per unit) . The sum of the livable horizontal areas on all levels of a building measured from the interior faces of the exterior walls, exclusive of basements, unfinished attics and attached garages. Each residential dwelling unit shall have separate and individual kitchen and bathroom facilities.
j)
Minimum Living Area Facade Width . The minimum width required for the front facade of a residential structure, exclusive of garages, porches, decks, or terraces. This requirement may apply to a continuous facade for multi-family or single-family attached units.
k)
Maximum Lot Coverage (Structures and Buildings) . The maximum amount of enclosed ground floor area of all buildings on a lot expressed as a percentage of the horizontally projected area representing the bulk and mass on the lot.
l)
Maximum Lot Coverage (All Impervious Surfaces) . The maximum amount of ground floor area occupied by buildings, structures, parking lots, or other impervious surfaces on a lot expressed as a percentage of the horizontally projected area of the lot.
3)
LOT STANDARDS TABLE. Lot Standards are listed in the following tables (Tables 4.4 and 4.5) under each district heading. Additional development standards including but not limited to parking, sign, and landscaping standards are set forth in Chapter VII: Development Standards.
