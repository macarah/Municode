(Ord. of 1-20-2011(02), § I)
Sec. 2-700. - Objectives.
modified
The following investment objectives shall be met with this policy:
(1)
Safeguarding of assets. Preservation of principal shall always be the foremost objective in any investment transaction involving the county funds. Those investing funds on the county's behalf must first ensure that capital losses are avoided by limiting credit and interest risk. Credit risk is loss due to the failure of the security issues or backer. Interest risk is the risk that market value portfolios will fall due to an increase in general interest rates.
(2)
Cash liquidity. The second objective shall be the maintenance of sufficient liquidity within the investment portfolio. The county's investment portfolio shall be structured such that securities mature at the time when cash is needed to meet anticipated demand (static liquidity). Additionally, since all possible demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should maintain some securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity).
(3)
Return on investment (ROI). The third objective shall be the realization of competitive investment rates, relative to the risk being assumed. However, yield on the county's investment portfolio is of second importance to the safety and liquidity objectives described above.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(02), § II)
Sec. 2-701. - Delegation of authority.

(b)
A system of internal controls over investments is established and approved by the county's independent auditors.

(Ord. of 1-20-2011(02), § IX)
Sec. 2-708. - Relationships with banks and brokers.
The county will select depositories through the county's banking services procurement process, including formal requests for proposals issued as needed. To the extent possible, preference will be given to depositories located within the county. The creditworthiness of the institutions should be a fundamental consideration.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(02), § X)
Sec. 2-709. - Report on deposits and investments.
Quarterly investment reports will be submitted to the county manager. Reports should include the following: an average daily balance of investment (if applicable), or principal value, in each investment category; a current portfolio yield for each investment type and for the portfolio as a whole; and a percent of available funds invested. The report shall also provide a list of investments as of the last day of the quarter. This in turn will be provided to the county commission.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(02), § XI)
Sec. 2-710. - Performance evaluation.
The county manager, or designees, will seek to achieve a market average rate of return on the county's portfolio. Given the special safety and liquidity needs of the county, the basis used to determine whether market yields are being achieved shall be the six-month treasury bill.

DIVISION 4. - FIXED ASSETS

Sec. 2-734. - Fixed asset criteria.
(a)
A fixed asset is defined as a financial resource meeting all of the following criteria:
(1)
It is tangible in nature.
(2)
It has a useful life of greater than one year.
(3)
It is not a repair part or supply item.
(4)
It has a value equal to, or greater than, the capitalization threshold of $5,000.00.
(b)
Exceptions.
(1)
All land shall be recorded.
(2)
Infrastructure shall be capitalized using the following:
a.
New road construction shall be capitalized when the unit cost of a new or replacement road at a specific location exceeds $150,000.00. Unit cost is defined as the cost to grade, drain, base and pave one mile of two-lane roadway.
b.
Resurface road shall be capitalized when the unit cost of repaving exceeds $50,000.00. Unit cost is defined as the cost to repave one mile of two-lane roadway.
c.
Bridges/culverts shall be capitalized when the unit cost is $60,000.00 or more for a specific location.
(c)
Keeping an accurate record of the county's fixed assets is important for a myriad of reasons. Some of the most important reasons that the county needs to keep a good record of fixed assets are for:
(1)
Financial statement information;
(2)
Insurable values;
(3)
Control and accountability;
(4)
Maintenance scheduling and cost analysis; for estimating and accounting for depreciation;
(5)
Preparation of capital and operating budgets; and
(6)
Debt management.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § A)
Sec. 2-735. - General policy.
Each department head is ultimately responsible for the proper recording, acquisition, transfer, and disposal of all assets within their department. County property may not be acquired, transferred, or disposed of without first providing proper documentation. A fixed asset information form must accompany each step.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § B(1))
Sec. 2-736. - Recording of fixed assets.
(a)
Unless otherwise approved by the county manager, all recordable fixed assets must be recorded within 30 calendar days after receipt and acceptance of the asset.
(b)
A fixed asset form must be attached to the purchase order before submitting a payment request.
(c)
Assets will be capitalized at acquisition cost, including expenses incurred in preparing the asset for use.
(d)
Donated assets shall be recorded at fair market value as determined by the department head. Fair market value may be defined as, but is not limited to, an average of documented prices for equivalent items from three separate vendors.
(e)
The county will recognize acquisition costs based on individual unit prices. Assets should not be grouped.
(f)
For equipment purchases, title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received. Similarly, for donated assets, title is considered to pass when the asset is available for the department's use and when it assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset.
(g)
Constructed assets are transferred from the construction in progress account to the related building, improvements other than buildings, or equipment accounts when they become operational. Constructed buildings, for example, are assumed to be operational when an authorization to occupy the building is issued, regardless of whether or not final payments have been made on all the construction contracts.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § B(2))
Sec. 2-737. - Acquisition of fixed assets.
There are various methods by which assets can be acquired. The asset acquisition method determines the basis for valuing the asset. Fixed assets may be acquired in the following ways:
(1)
New purchases.
(2)
Donations.
(3)
Transfers from other departments.
(4)
County surplus.
(5)
Internal/external construction.
(6)
Lease purchases.
(7)
Trade-in.
(8)
Forfeiture or condemnation.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § B(3))
Sec. 2-738. - Lease purchases.
(a)
Assets may be lease-purchased through installment purchases (an agreement in which title passes to the department) or through lease financing arrangements (an agreement which title may or may not pass).
(b)
Departments considering a lease purchase for greater than $10,000.00 and other than from an established, county-approved contract, must consult with the county manager.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § B(4))
Sec. 2-739. - Transfer of fixed assets.
An asset transfer between departments usually represents a form of sale of an item by one department to another and may be treated as a new purchase. A transfer between related departments under the same control (sheriff and jail, for example) may, if desired, be treated as a transfer rather than sale. This asset is recorded under the new department with original acquired date and funding amount.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § B(5))
Sec. 2-740. - Sale of fixed assets.
Sale of fixed assets by a department must be to the highest, responsible bidder and must be conducted by sealed bid or auction. The sale must be publicized in accordance with county and state law.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § B(6))
Sec. 2-741. - Disposal of fixed assets.
(a)
When an asset is disposed of, its value is removed from the financial balances reported and from inventory reports. However, the asset record, including disposal information, remains on the master file for three years, in the county clerk's office, after which time it is purged from the system according to general accepted accounting principles. This preserves an audit trail for disposed items, and facilitates departmental comparisons between actual or historical useful life information with useful life guidelines. Such comparisons permit a more precise definition of an asset's useful life than those provided by the internal revenue service (IRS) or other guidelines initially used.
(b)
A disposal action is appropriate only when certain conditions occur resulting in an asset no longer being in the possession of the agency. Assets no longer in use, which remain in the possession of the department, are considered surplus property and not a disposal.
(c)
Fixed assets may be disposed of in any one of six ways:
(1)
Sale or trade-in;
(2)
Abandonment/retirement;
(3)
Lost or stolen;
(4)
Transfer;
(5)
Cannibalization (taking parts and employing them for like uses within the department, such as is often the practice in computer or vehicle maintenance);
(6)
Casualty loss.
Only when the asset is no longer in possession of the department, due to one of the six reasons listed above, is disposal action appropriate.
(d)
Assets are "abandoned" or "retired" when there is no longer any use for them in the department; they are of no use to any other county department; they cannot be repaired, transferred, cannibalized, sold, or traded-in. Thus meaning that, there is no safe and appropriate use for the abandoned goods to the county or for others.
(e)
Stolen items must be reported to sheriff's office and a report filed. A copy of this report must accompany the disposal record.
(f)
Casualty losses must be documented within 24 hours of loss and reported to the finance officer immediately for follow-up with the county's insurance carrier.
(g)
Cannibalized items are considered surplus and are disposed of by noting cannibalization on the disposal record. Ideally, this method will allow departments to look at cannibalized items on the disposal report and assess what surplus parts may be available. Departments will send documentation of items cannibalized to the county clerk's office, and all remaining costs and accumulated depreciation will be removed from appropriate asset accounts in the general fixed asset fund.
(h)
All assets no longer in the possession of the department, due to one of these six qualifying conditions and after submission of all appropriate documentation to the county clerk's office, will be removed from the master departmental asset file and considered disposed.
(i)
Department heads are responsible for reviewing disposal reports, evaluating causes and trends leading to disposals, and implementing procedures to more effectively manage and control disposals when the dispositions represent problems, inefficiencies, and/or the incurrence of unnecessary cost.
(Ord. of 1-20-2011(01), § B(7))
Sec. 2-742. - Physical inventory.
An annual physical inventory of all fixed assets will be performed at the direction of the county manager.

DIVISION 5. - FUND BALANCE POLICY

Sec. 2-768. - Definition.
Fund balance, as defined by the Governmental Accounting, Auditing and Financial Reporting of the Government Finance Officers Association, is "the difference between fund assets and fund liabilities of governmental and similar trust funds." There are two types of fund balance: reserved and unreserved. Additionally, there are two subdivisions of unreserved fund balance: designated and undesignated. These will be discussed in further detail as follows:
(1)
Reservations of fund balance are made for legal purposes such as reserves for debt service, long-term receivables, employees' retirement, and others. Reservations of fund balance represent financial resources which are not available for expenditure. This is because either the funds have been obligated to meet specific legal obligations (debt service or retirement obligations) or because the funds will not be received in a timely enough fashion to be available for the subsequent year's appropriation (long-term receivables.)
(2)
Unreserved fund balance attempts to measure how much will be left over at the end of the current fiscal year which can be used for the subsequent fiscal year's budget. There are financial resources, which are available for appropriation. Unreserved fund balance is further broken-down into two components: designated and undesignated.
a.
Designations of fund balance reflect the board's intended use of resources and should reflect actual plans approved by the governing body. Designations of fund balance are collectively reported on the face of the balance sheet and rarely itemized in the notes to the financial statements. Designated fund balance may or may not be appropriated for expenditure in the subsequent year depending on the timing of the project/item for which they were designated.
b.
Undesignated fund balance represents financial resources which are not obligated (reserved) or specifically designated and which are available as source of funds for general appropriation.
(Ord. of 11-2-2010, § A)
Sec. 2-769. - Purpose.
(a)
Adoption of a fund balance policy is appropriate in order to secure and maintain investment-grade credit ratings; meet seasonal shortfalls in cash flow; and reduce susceptibility to emergency or unanticipated expenditures and/or revenue shortfalls.
(b)
This fund balance policy defines:
(1)
How designations of fund balance will be made;
(2)
The method of budgeting the amount of estimated unreserved, undesignated fund balance available for appropriation during the annual budget process (prior to the actual, audited fund balance being known); and
(3)
What actions may need to be taken if the actual fund balance is significantly different than the budgeted fund balance.
(Ord. of 11-2-2010, § B)
Sec. 2-770. - Policy.
modified
(a)
Designations of fund balance. Designations of unreserved fund balance may be made for such purposes including, but not limited to, major maintenance and repair projects, meeting future obligations resulting from a natural disaster, meeting insurance deductibles and for setting aside amounts for specific projects not included in the general appropriation of undesignated fund balance.
(b)
Appropriation of undesignated fund balance. The actual amount of undesignated fund balance is not known until the completion of the annual audit. However, an estimate of undesignated fund balance (also called estimated beginning fund balance) shall be made during the annual budget process.
(c)
Estimated beginning fund balance. In order to achieve the most accurate estimate possible, the county manager shall project both sources of funds (revenues, prior years fund balances carried forward and other financing sources) and uses of funds (operating and non-operating expenditures), including accruals, for each department in each governmental fund through June 30 of the then current fiscal year. These projections will be shown in budget documents for each fund. The difference between the estimate actual sources of funds and estimated actual uses of funds, is the calculated estimated beginning fund balance for the subsequent fiscal year. If planned for use in the subsequent fiscal year, designated fund balance may be included in the estimated beginning fund balance.
(d)
Estimated ending fund balance. For the year being budgeted, a calculation of ending fund balance shall also be made. This calculation shall be the difference between the budgeted sources of funds and the budgeted uses of funds as described above. Since the uses of funds are restricted in all other fund types there is no limit to the amount of ending fund balance unless the project is completed and the funds should be closed. In this situation, a residual equity transfer will be made to zero-out any remaining fund balance. If, after the annual audit, the actual unreserved, undesignated fund balance is greater than 25 percent of operating expenditures in the general fund, the excess may be used in one or a combination of the following ways:
(1)
Left in the general fund to earn interest and roll forward into the subsequent year's beginning fund balance;
(2)
Appropriated by the board for one-time expenditures that do not increase recurring operating costs;
(3)
Used to establish or increase a legitimate reservation or designation of fund balance;
(4)
Appropriated for start-up expenditures of new programs undertaken at mid-year, provided that such action is considered in the context of board-approved multiyear projections of revenues and expenditures;
(5)
Designated to establish a discretionary stabilization fund, which may be used at the board's discretion to address temporary cash flow shortages, emergencies, unanticipated economic downturns and one-time opportunities.
