(Ord. No. 10-11, § I, 12-14-2010; Ord. No. 04-13, § I, 2-12-2013)
Sec. 2-562. - Pre-approval of employee travel.
(a)
Pre-approval of employee and elected official travel is required in the following circumstances:

Any travel which involves air transportation; or
(3)
Any travel in excess of 25 miles from the city.

Elected officials who travel under the circumstances listed in subsection (a) of this section must be approved by the mayor and council. Employee travel satisfying the criteria listed in subsection (a) of this section must be requested by the officer or employee on a conference or out-of-town trip request form, approved by the applicable department head and approved by the city manager. All out-of-town travel which does not meet the criteria listed in subsection (a) of this section (i.e., travel less than 25 miles from the city and not involving an overnight stay) shall be subject to the approval requirement promulgated by the individual department head (subject to approved budget). Pre-approval of travel, meeting the requirements listed in subsection (a) of this section, is required by all officers and employees.
(Ord. No. 10-11, § II, 12-14-2010; Ord. No. 04-13, § II, 2-12-2013)
Sec. 2-563. - Required documentation.
(a)
Conference or out-of-town trip request form. This form must be completed for employee or elected official travel which satisfies the criteria noted section 2-562. In those instances when pre-approval is required, this form must accompany the reimbursement request submitted to the mayor's office.
(b)
Report of travel expenditures form. This form must be completed and approved by the applicable department head and city council, whenever an employee requests reimbursement for business-related expenses, or the mayor and council when an elected official requests reimbursement for business-related expenses. Request for routine mileage reimbursement not related to a conference or business trip, should be requested on the city's separate mileage reimbursement request form. Supporting documentation, consisting of receipts, paid invoices, hotel bills, etc., should be attached to the report of travel expenditures form to substantiate the reimbursement request. This form, and the supporting documentation, should be forwarded to the mayor's office with the city's standard voucher payable form in a single reimbursement request for the entire cost of the trip. All reimbursement requests must be submitted within 15 days after returning from the trip. If a reimbursement request has not been filed within the time period, for any cost incurred and city credit card used, payment will be deducted from payroll for that amount.
(c)
Original receipts. Original receipts accompany all reimbursement requests. The mayor's office will return any reimbursement request unpaid to the originating department or elected official who is not in compliance with this policy.
(Ord. No. 10-11, § III, 12-14-2010; Ord. No. 04-13, § III, 2-12-2013)
Sec. 2-564. - Limits on expenses.
(a)
Meal expenses will be reimbursed per meal allowances of $36.00 per day. Meal receipts are required to document reimbursement unless a per-diem check is used for the meal. Meal expenses for trips which are not overnight are not reimbursable without the approval of the city manager. An employee or elected official on a one-day business trip is eligible for one meal if his work schedule for the convenience of the city extends beyond eight hours.
(b)
Personal car mileage is reimbursed at rates provided by the city (IRS Mileage Rate). Reimbursement for car expenses will be made only to the driver. Mileage will be reimbursed only by the shortest route. When using a personal automobile for a day trip which originates from home, the mileage reported for reimbursement should be from home or from the city hall, whichever is less. If a mode of transportation other than a city-supplied vehicle, and other than the employee's or elected official's personal automobile is used, the mode and cost of transportation must be approved in writing by the city council.
(c)
Hotel expenses for meetings for the city are reimbursable only with advance approval of the city council. Without such pre-approval, conference or meeting expense reimbursements will not be paid. Employees or elected officials are encouraged to choose the most reasonably convenient and economical lodging possible. Employees or elected officials are required to inquire about a government rate for lodging or renting a vehicle, and to mention the required use of the hotel/motel tax exemption.
(d)
Combined business and personal travel. If an employee or elected official combines business and personal travel, expenses should be paid directly by the employee or elected official, not charged to the city, for all those expenses or portion of expenses which are personal. The city will only reimburse that portion of a trip and those expenses which are directly related to city business. In those cases where an employee or elected official decides to have a family member accompany him on a business trip, the employee or elected official must pay all additional expenses (e.g., incremental hotel charges, meals, travel, etc.). No adjustment is permitted to cover the expenses of accompanying family members. No family member charges are to be permitted on the city's charge card.
(e)
Non-reimbursable expenses. The city will only pay for reimbursable expenses which are directly related to the business purpose of the travel. Personal expenses will not be reimbursed and will not be added on the city charge card. Examples of non-reimbursable expenses include:
(1)
Personal (non-job related) telephone calls.
(2)
Dry cleaning.
(3)
Personal expenses (toiletries, clothing, etc.) and personal trip insurance.
(4)
Personal legal charges and traffic violations.
(5)
Personal property loss, theft or damage.
(6)
Alcoholic beverages.
(7)
Airline club fees.
(8)
Personal side trips and entertainment (movies, etc.).
(9)
Recreational, health and gym facility fees.
(10)
Loss or theft of cash, travel tickets, or credit cards.
(Ord. No. 10-11, § IV, 12-14-2010; Ord. No. 04-13, § IV, 2-12-2013; Ord. of 5-9-2017)
Sec. 2-565. - Compliance auditing.
(a)
Department managers signing the report of travel expenditures forms are responsible for ensuring that all travel claims originating from their departments are in compliance with the city's travel policy. Travel claims should view all submissions for completeness, mathematical accuracy, compliance with expense limitations and overall compliance with the policy.
(b)
The city clerk's office is responsible for compliance verification with the city travel policy. Travel claims which are submitted to the city clerk's office for payment processing will be processed only if they contain the following documentation:
(1)
Conference or out of town trip request form completed and signed by the city manager, when pre-approval of travel is required.
(2)
Report of travel expenditures form completed, signed by employee or elected official and approved by the city council.
(3)
Original receipts attached to substantiate all expenses.
(4)
Standard city payment voucher form completed and signed.
All travel claims which are incomplete will be returned by the city clerk's office to the employees' respective department heads or elected officials.
(c)
Employees or municipal officials cannot make false statements and writings, conceal facts, or present fraudulent documents in municipal matters, according to O.C.G.A. § 16-10-20. This includes the material an official produces for a travel expense report, travel requests or other travel-related forms.
