It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government.

To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city;
(3)
To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the city;
(4)
To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
