Description of districts.
(1)
Agricultural district (A-1). This district is established to provide for rural farm or nonfarm residences in areas where intensive land development is unlikely to or should not occur, yet permits a variety of housing options.
(2)
Interior agricultural district (A-2). This district is established to provide for rural farm or nonfarm residences and agricultural pursuits in areas where intensive land development is unlikely to occur within the next five to ten years.
(3)
Lakefront agricultural district (A-3). This district is established to provide for rural farm or nonfarm residences and agricultural pursuits in areas that will eventually develop as prime lakefront residential development.
(4)
Low-density residential district (R-1). This district is established to provide for low to medium density single-family residential uses.
(5)
Medium-density residential district (R-2). This district is established to provide for medium to high density single-family residential and two-family residential uses.
(6)
High-density residential (R-3). This district is established to provide for high density single-family residential uses, two-family residential uses, multifamily residential uses, manufactured homes meeting the requirements of this chapter and manufactured home parks.
(7)
Neighborhood commercial district (C-1). This district is established to provide decentralized areas for the retail sales of goods and for personal services which provide the everyday necessities and conveniences of local residents. This district is intended to permit only those nonresidential commercial uses of land and structures which blend smoothly into the character of adjoining residential areas. It is further intended to exclude all activities which generate perceptible light or noise or attract traffic from outside the immediate neighborhood.
(8)
General commercial district (C-2). This district is established to provide for both highway commercial and planned commercial shopping or service centers. This district is intended to be utilized by those commercial uses which cater to community and regional shoppers as well as the traveling public. These commercial uses occupy relatively large sites and require access to major thoroughfares. It is intended that this district be located at major road intersections as provided by the county's development plan.
(9)
Heavy commercial district (C-3). This district is established to provide areas for distribution, sales, service or storage activities involving goods or equipment requiring extensive indoor or outdoor spaces, large or specialized handling equipment or significant truck or rail transportation. These uses generate limited emissions and noise which make them incompatible with other commercial or residential uses.
(10)
Light industrial district (M-1). This district is established to provide areas for industry in locations which lie near residential areas or which are served by major transportation facilities and adequate utilities but are not feasible nor highly desirable for conventional industrial development because of proximity to residential, recreational, retail or related developments. The regulations of this district are intended to encourage development compatible with uses of residential property adjoining or surrounding the district, with suitable open spaces, landscaping and parking areas.
(11)
General industrial district (M-2). This district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, assembling, fabricating, warehousing and related activities. These uses generate some emissions and have some adverse effects on surrounding properties and are not compatible with primary commercial, institutional and residential uses.
(12)
Professional district (P-1). This district is established to provide for the development of structures for professional services which do not generate large volumes of traffic, noise or other harmful effects on adjoining residential areas. It is intended that this district serve as a transition between more intensely developed commercial districts and residential districts.
(13)
Planned unit development district (PUD). The intent of this section is to permit greater flexibility and consequently more creative and imaginative design for the development of residential, commercial and industrial areas than is generally possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a high level of amenities and preservations of natural qualities of open spaces. Within the planned unit development a variety of housing types and land uses may be permitted in an orderly relationship to one another and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to comprehensive planning within the county. It is intended that this district be permitted only in areas where public water, sewer and other urban services are available.
(14)
Planned development district (PDD). The intent of this use is to serve as a transition between more intensely developed commercial districts and single-family residential areas along major growth corridors. Special consideration shall be given to traffic safety, off-street parking and how the proposed development relates to and is buffered from existing homes. Major growth corridors are areas designated by resolution of the board of commissioners of the county, where intense growth is projected and where major road improvements are planned, in progress, or have been completed.
(15)
Entrance/lake corridor overlay district (ELCO). The intent of this district is to protect and preserve the aesthetic character of major entrances into the county and along entrances to lakeshore areas and to reduce conflict between new construction and existing development and viewsheds. The corridors measure 250 feet to both sides from the centerline of a designated highway or street.
