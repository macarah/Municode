DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 6-31. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
It is the purpose of the board of commissioners in enacting this article to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this article to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, while allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business and comply with the federal and state constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the board of commissioners has determined the following:
(1)
Large billboards are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, and aesthetic harm;
(2)
The state supreme court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of the environment; and
(3)
The Eleventh Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard.
The holdings show that this article is within the law and therefore constitutional, which is a goal of the county.
(b)
Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety, by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this article to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction.

The removal order shall be issued only after the appropriate party fails to comply with the terms of this article within seven working days after the receipt of written notice of noncompliance from the planning commission, or within ten working days from the mailing of such notice if no return receipt is received indicating acceptance.
(2)
An aggrieved party may appeal the removal order within ten working days from the date that the notice was received. Such appeal shall be as provided in section 34-428. If the sign is not removed within:

(2)
The sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any member of the public.
(c)
Cost of removal. The removal or the cost of removal of any sign as provided for in this article shall be the responsibility of the sign owner and without liability to the county, its officers, agents, servants and employees. If the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then the costs of removal shall be the responsibility of the sign erector and/or property owner or any other party associated with the placement of the sign. If removed by the county as referenced in this article, and for the purposes of collecting any and all reimbursable cost to the county for such removal; if payment, or satisfactory arrangements to make payment, is not made by the property owner, sign erector, or owner within 30 days after the receipt of the statement, the enforcement personnel shall certify the amount thereof for collection to the county attorney. The county shall be afforded all means available to remedy the collection of the reimbursable funds. If any signs that are removed remain unclaimed for more than 60 days from the date of removal, the signs may be disposed of in accordance with state law.
(d)
Invalid permits. The enforcement personnel may issue a removal order when it has been determined that a permit was improperly issued as a result of misstatement of fact or fraud, that the sign has not been placed or constructed in compliance with this article or with the specifications of the application or site plans, that the sign permit has expired or that the sign is otherwise not in compliance with this article. If a sign is not removed after receipt of a removal order, enforcement personnel may institute legal proceedings hereunder against the property owner, sign owner, lessee, sign erector, associated party, or combination thereof.

Upon failure to comply with the requirements of this article, the planning commission may cause the removal of any nonconforming sign at the expense of the owner or associated party.
(2)
A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign except that the substitution or interchange of advertising panels, painted boards or demountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted. Those signs considered grandfathered upon the passage of zoning shall be governed by the signage requirements for the zoning classification, as designated by the DCA, which most closely approximates its use.
