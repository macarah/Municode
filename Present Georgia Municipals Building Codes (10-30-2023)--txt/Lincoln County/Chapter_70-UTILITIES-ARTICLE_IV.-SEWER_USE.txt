Capacity. The liquid capacity of septic tanks for single-family dwellings shall not be less than 750 gallons for one or two bedrooms; 900 gallons for three bedrooms; 1,000 gallons for four bedrooms and 250 additional gallons for each bedroom over four. The liquid capacity of septic tanks in on-site sewage management systems for nonresidential usage shall be based on the anticipated daily sewage flow from the facility served, but in no case shall be increased by 50 percent where garbage grinders are to be used.
(d)
Compartmented tanks. Compartmented tanks are permissible upon approval by the county board of health.
(e)
Tanks in series. The county board of health may approve the installation of two septic tanks placed in series provided that the capacity of the first tank is at least 750 gallons and at least equal to the capacity of the second tank. When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank.
(f)
Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level, on a foundation that will prevent settling; backfill shall be placed so that a stable fill results and undue strain on the tank is avoided. Earth backfill shall be free of voids, large stones, stumps, broken masonry, or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is recommended. All openings and manholes shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of surface water.
(Ord. No. 4, § 5, 10-2-1984)
Sec. 70-234. - Distribution boxes and dosing tanks.
(a)
Minimum design and construction of distribution boxes. Distribution boxes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established in the department's current manual and section 70-235(d)(1). Approval procedures shall follow the requirements as set forth under section 70-233(a).
(b)
Minimum design and construction of dosing tanks. Where required, dosing tanks shall be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with the department's current manual.
(Ord. No. 4, § 6, 10-2-1984)
Sec. 70-235. - Absorption fields.
(a)
Area computation Absorption trench bottom area shall be based upon the anticipated volume of treated sewage and upon the characteristics of the soil in which absorption fields are to be located as specified in the current on-site sewage management system manual. Soil characteristics and other related data, including percolation tests, may be required by the county board of health.
(b)
Location. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells or springs; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be crossed by a water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe. No absorption field shall be installed in areas where groundwater, soil characteristics or adverse geological formation may interfere with the absorption of sewage effluent.
(c)
Minimum design and construction for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption lines and absorption trench bottoms shall be true to grade, and trenches shall be not less than 25 inches in depth, and shall have not less than 12 inches of earth cover. Maximum length of absorption trench laterals for distribution box systems shall be 100 feet; laterals shall be equal in length and spaced no less than eight feet apart, center to center. Absorption trenches shall not be more than 36 inches wide.
(d)
Field layout methods for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption fields shall be planned and installed in accordance with one of the following methods:
(1)
Distribution box method. On level or sloping topography, the distribution box method may be used and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A firm earthen or concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to insure against the tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care shall be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of six inches but no more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box and terminate inside the distribution box with an elbow turned downward to form a submerged outlet at normal water level, or a baffle may be used, providing the same function is accomplished. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but at all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid in uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with the minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer, longer trenches.
(2)
Level field method. On level or slightly sloping topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines interconnected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting shall be used to interconnect the absorption lines.
(3)
Serial distribution method. On more severely sloping topography, the serial distribution method may be used. When this method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption lines and terminate at any point in the line so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth to aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth.
(Ord. No. 4, § 7, 10-2-1984)
Sec. 70-236. - Privies.
Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established by the current on-site sewage management system manual.
(Ord. No. 4, § 8, 10-2-1984)
Sec. 70-237. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems and site modifications.
(a)
Generally. The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health.
(b)
Information required for installation. The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on the public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition including community managed on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems. When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the county board of health:
(1)
Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory, or field data required.
(2)
Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making application will be informed by the county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures deemed necessary by the county board of health. Reduction of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy.
(c)
Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The department may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site and system specific factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system.
(d)
Site modifications. Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage systems, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval, detailed plans showing the type and extent of modifications. The county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit.
(Ord. No. 4, § 9, 10-2-1984)
Sec. 70-238. - Percolation tests and test borings.
(a)
Use of tests. If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such tests shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevations during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems.
(b)
Location and number. Percolation test holes shall be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in absorption field area. The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be determined by the county board of health. The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristics of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designations, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map.
(c)
Test borings for rock, shale and hardpan. Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service. Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map.
(d)
Individuals conducting tests. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the county board of health, such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a county board of health representative.
