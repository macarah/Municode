ARTICLE 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

Sec. 8-1-1. - Statutory authorization.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Augusta Commission of Augusta, Georgia does ordain the provisions of this Chapter:
( Ord. No. 7147 , § 1, 9-15-2009; Ord. No. 7282 , § 8-1-1, 9-6-2011; Ord. No. 7574 , § 1(8-1-1), 6-29-2017; Ord. No. 7687 , § 8-1-1, 10-21-2019; Ord. No. 7752 , § 8-1-1, 2-2-2021)
Sec. 8-1-2. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of Augusta, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
( Ord. No. 7147 , § 1, 9-15-2009; Ord. No. 7282 , § 8-1-2, 9-6-2011; Ord. No. 7574 , § 1(8-1-2), 6-29-2017; Ord. No. 7687 , § 8-1-2, 10-21-2019; Ord. No. 7752 , § 8-1-2, 2-2-2021)
Sec. 8-1-3. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(a)
restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(b)
require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(c)
control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(d)
control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and;
(e)
prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
( Ord. No. 7147 , § 1, 9-15-2009; Ord. No. 7282 , § 8-1-3, 9-6-2011; Ord. No. 7574 , § 1(8-1-3), 6-29-2017; Ord. No. 7687 , § 8-1-3, 10-21-2019; Ord. No. 7752 , § 8-1-3, 2-2-2021)
Sec. 8-1-4. - Objectives.
The objectives of this Chapter are:
(a)
to protect human life and health;
(b)
to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(c)
to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d)
to minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e)
to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
(f)
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
(g)
to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

0.2% Annual Chance Floodplain. The land within a community subject to a 0.2 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year
Accessory Structure. A structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the primary structure. For floodplain management purposes, accessory structures must only be used for parking or storage, be not larger than one-story and not greater than 600 square feet in size, represent a minimal investment by the property owner, and have low flood damage potential.
Development of accessory structures that are not used only for parking or storage, or are larger than one-story in height, or 600 square feet in size, or which have a medium or high flood damage potential, must be designed and constructed to meet or exceed the minimum requirements for structures in SFHAs as set forth in this Chapter; to include any structure that has a human habitation component (apartment, carriage house, guest house, bath house, recreational rooms or game rooms) and structures such as gazebos, pergolas and carports that are not walled and roofed.
Further, when a parcel of land has only one structure, that structure is considered the principal structure for floodplain management purposes, even if the structure would otherwise meet the definition for accessory structure based on its size and use. In these cases, the accessory structure must be elevated or dry floodproofed pursuant to the requirement of this Chapter, unless the property owner applies for and is granted a variance to allow the accessory structure to be wet floodproofed pursuant to the requirements found in 8-1-32(k)(3).

Walled and Roofed. A structure that has 2 or more exterior rigid walls and a fully secured roof and that is affixed to a permanent site.
Wet Floodproofing. The use of flood damage-resistant materials and construction techniques to minimize flood damage to structures by intentionally allowing floodwater to enter and exit automatically (without human intervention) to minimize unequal pressure of water on walls (called hydrostatic load or pressure). Wet floodproofing also requires structures to be anchored to resist flooding, floatation of lateral movement, have mechanical and utility equipment elevated or protected, and have flood openings installed in walls. Wet floodproofing measures for flood protection are limited to enclosures used solely for parking, building access, or storage below elevated buildings; historic structures and functionally dependent uses (both defined by the NFIP), when authorized by variance as found in Section 8-1-32(k); and agricultural structures and accessory structures when authorized by variance as found in 8-1-32(k), and in accordance with guidelines for wet floodproofing as established by FEMA for such a use.
Zone. A geographical area shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

(e)
In reviewing such requests, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this Chapter, and:
(1)
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2)
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3)
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4)
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(5)
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
(6)
The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
(7)
The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8)
The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and Floodplain Management Program for that area;
(9)
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10)
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(11)
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(f)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.
(g)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway or the lower floodway fringe, if ANY increase in flood levels (flood heights) during the base flood discharge would result.
(h)
Conditions for variances.
(1)
The provisions of this Chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the structure.
(2)
A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is:
(a)
a finding of good and sufficient cause,
(b)
a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and;
(c)
a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. At the discretion of the Zoning Board of Appeals, a No-Rise Certification, with supporting technical data and signed by a registered professional engineer, may be required to ensure that there is no rise in flood heights with the proposed development.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the Base Flood Elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(i)
The Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(j)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(k)
Variances may be issued for construction or substantial improvements of accessory structures and agricultural structures provided the requirements of this Chapter and the following area satisfied:
(1)
Accessory structures. A determination that the proposed accessory structure:
(a)
Represents minimal investment and has low flood damage potential (amount of physical damage, contents damage, and loss of function).

(d)
Floodway. Located within the Area of Special Flood Hazard established in Article 3, Section 8-1-17, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels (flood heights) or floodway widths during a base flood discharge (a No-Rise Certification). A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and his/her certification thereof.
(2)
ONLY if Article 5, Section 8-1-44(d)(1) above is satisfied, then any new construction and substantial improvement shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three (3) feet above the flood elevation based upon the floodway encroachment, as given by the "With Floodway" column in the Flood Insurance Study Floodway Data Table. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article 5, Section 8-1-43(j), "Elevated Structures".
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all mechanical, electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no lower than three (3) feet above the flood elevation based upon the floodway encroachment, as given by the "With Floodway" column in the Flood Insurance Study Floodway Data Table.
(3)
The placement of manufactured homes shall be prohibited. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of § 8-1-43(b) are met, and the elevation standards of § 8-1-44(a) and the encroachments standards of subsection (1) of this Section are met.

(5)
Accessory structures shall be prohibited in the floodway.
(e)
Floodway fringe, lower. Within the lower floodway fringe is the area between the floodway and the upper floodway fringe that is lower than a lines one-half (½) the distance between the floodway and the boundary of the Area of Special Flood Hazard. The lower floodway fringe is a transitional area that is hazardous due to its proximity to the floodway and encroachment by fill or development within this area could have serious impact on the entire floodplain. The following provisions shall apply with the lower floodway fringe:
(1)
Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer, with supporting technical data, is provided to the Director demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels (flood heights) during occurrence of base flood discharge (a No-Rise Certification).

A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of Article 5, Section 8-1-43(b), and the elevation standards of Article 5, Section 8-1-44(a), and the encroachment standards of Article 5, Section 8-1-44(d)(1) are met.
(4)
Removal of trees and other vegetation may not be a consideration in calculating the effect of proposed encroachments on flood levels (flood heights) during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(5)
The placement of an accessory structure shall only be allowed if, at the discretion of the Director, or Direction of Engineering, it is deemed to have a low flood damage potential. All requirements of 8-1-43(k) must be met.
(f)
Large tracts. If a tract contains over one (1) acre located within the Area of Special Flood Hazard, then development or land disturbance on that portion of the tract located within the Area of Special Flood Hazard shall comply with the standards for lower floodway fringe set forth in § 8-1-44(e).
(g)
Other area unsuitable for development. Land subject to flooding that is not located within a mapped Area of Special Flood Hazard may, at the discretion of the Director or Director of Engineering, be required to comply with any or all standards set forth in this Chapter.
(h)
Grading in the area of special flood hazard. Grading (including excavating, filling, or any culmination thereof) shall be prohibited in the Area of Special Flood Hazard except for the following:
(1)
Minimum land disturbing activities such as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work and other related activities;

Pursuant to 8-1-43(m), when a parcel of land has only one structure, that structure is considered the principal structure for floodplain management purposes, even if the structure would otherwise meet the definition for accessory structure based on its size and use. In these cases, the accessory structure must be elevated pursuant to 8-1-44(a) or dry floodproofed pursuant to the requirements of 8-1-44(b), unless the property owner applies for and is granted a variance to allow the accessory structure to be wet floodproofed.
(k)
Agricultural structures.
For floodplain management purposes, agricultural structures must larger than 600 square feet and must be only be used for agricultural purposes, or uses in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, raising, or drying of agricultural commodities and livestock. Structures used for human habitation and those that are places of employment or entertainment, and structures with multiple or mixed purposes, do not satisfy the "exclusive use" requirement as described in this definition.
Development of agricultural structures that are not walled and roofed, may be used for human habitation (including worker dormitories), employment, manufacturing or entertainment, or which are not used exclusively for agricultural purposes, or which have a medium or high flood damage potential, must be designed and constructed to meet or exceed the minimum requirements for structures in SFHAs as set forth in this Chapter.
