Editor's note— Ord. No. 7226 , adopted Feb. 1, 2011, amended Ch. 4 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 4, §§ 8-4-1—8-4-17, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 6589 , 1-21-2003.

Chapter 8-4-1. - Purpose and intent.
This Chapter of the Ordinance provides standards for the protection of public trees, and for the designation of landmark trees, and further provides landscaping, tree protection and tree establishment standards for the development of public or private property in Augusta, Georgia. Consistent with the expressed purpose of this article, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees as defined herein.
It is the intent of this Ordinance that all applicable sites within the City maintain or obtain a thirty percent (30%) minimum tree canopy, as defined and explained herein.
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of provisions designed to:
(a)
Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance/offset negative effects of climate change by contributing to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, wildlife habitat, groundwater recharge, and storm water runoff retardation, while concurrently facilitating noise, glare, and heat abatement;
(b)
Encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation on-site and replanting of trees to increase canopy coverage across the city in order to maximize carbon sequestration;
(c)
Prevent soil erosion;
(d)
Protect and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the community;
(e)
Prevent structural and pavement saturation;
(f)
Safeguard and enhance private property values and protect private and public investments;
(g)
Conserve energy.
( Ord. No. 7226 , 2-1-2011; Ord. No. 7285 , ch. 8-4-1, 9-6-2011; Ord. No. 7562 , § 2(8-4-1), 2-21-2017)
Chapter 8-4-2. - Minimum canopy required.
PURPOSE. The City desires that a minimum amount of tree canopy coverage be required on all new development sites, redevelopment sites, and all sites with additions or expansions, on all land uses within the City's jurisdiction.
REQUIREMENTS. All land undergoing development shall provide for thirty percent (30%) minimum tree canopy coverage. Tree canopy coverage is the sum total of preserved trees and replacement trees at their anticipated canopy coverage ten (10) years from the time that the site is developed. As set forth in the IGO.
The canopy may be achieved by preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards in this Ordinance, or by a combination of the two. Minimum tree canopy shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in this Ordinance and illustrated in the Illustrated Guide (IGO). Any existing tree, from the approved list in the IGO, of not less than six inches (6") diameter at breast height (DBH) left in good growing condition on the property is eligible to be counted toward the minimum required canopy and has to be protected. The property owner shall be subject to the minimum tree canopy requirement set forth in this section. The property owner shall base the canopy calculation on the gross site area.
•
If a site over one (1) acre in size was formerly in a forested state and fifty percent (50%) or more the land area was "clear cut" within three (3) years of the plan submittal date without an approved Site Plan, that includes approved grading and erosion and sedimentation practices, for any land disturbing activity that took place, then the property will be prohibited from developing for three (3) years. It will be the applicant's responsibility to provide proof that any clear cutting activity on the site was done by an approved Site Plan than included an approved grading and erosion and sedimentation plan or took place greater than three years prior to the current submittal date.
(1)
Calculation of Tree Canopy Coverage
(a)
The baseline canopy measurements on a proposed development site shall be provided by the developer/property owner and submitted as part of the tree survey and Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan. The percent canopy cover preserved may be calculated by actual ground measurement (field survey) or by aerial photographs from Augusta, Georgia's GIS, to scale.
(b)
All trees to be preserved shall follow tree preservation guidelines established by this Ordinance in Chapter 8-4-9 and in Chapter 8-4-11 for Landmark Trees.
(c)
The Minimum Canopy Requirement shall be calculated by the following formula:
MCR = SA x 0.3
Where:
MCR = Minimum Canopy Requirement (in square feet — 30%)
SA = The gross Site Area (in square feet)
Calculation: example
Step 1: SA— 43,560 sq. ft. x .30 = 13,068 sq. ft. MCR
Step 2: Preserved Canopy from Tree Survey = 5,350 sq. ft.
Step 3: MCR (13,068 sq. ft.) - Preserved Canopy (5,350 sq. ft.) = 7,718 sq. ft. to meet MCR
Step 4: Select enough overstory and understory trees to equal area to meet MCR
Step 5. Trees planted or replanted to achieve canopy requirements shall be selected from the Augusta Tree Species Selection list set forth in this Ordinance. In addition, replanting/new planting shall be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree for every three understory trees. Canopy credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees. All replacement trees shall be maintained for a period of three years under a Tree Establishment Bond (see Section 8-4-15) to ensure their survivability. Required trees on the site must be maintained/retained in perpetuity or replacement plantings of the same size and species must be planted should the tree become diseased, die, become a public health hazard, or is removed for any reason.
(2)
Mitigation Policy
(a)
If a tree designated as a protected tree on tree survey or a Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan is required to be removed due to building footprint, damage from construction, or dies during development, the developer shall be required to replant a tree(s) of equal size and caliper on the site.
(3)
All mitigation shall follow requirements established in Chapter 8-4-20 of this Ordinance.
(4)
Tree Survey
(a)
In order to assure that the location of existing trees and vegetation on the development site is acknowledged prior to preparing any design plans for development, a tree survey is required. The tree survey must be submitted to the Planning & Development Department
(b)
in advance of, or with a Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan, and prior to any land disturbing activity and will be reviewed as part of the Tree Plan review process.
º
Elements required as a part of the tree survey include: a map, drawn to scale, and a written component, identifying any potential landmark, specimen and significant trees, and identifying all existing trees on the site with identification of what is to be preserved and what is to be removed.
(c)
A certified arborist, landscape architect, or forester shall evaluate the tree survey to determine what existing trees will be preserved, and how it can be incorporated into the Development Plans/Site Plans for the site. Critical Root protection zones for all trees to be preserved shall be indicated on the tree survey.
(d)
Details for planting, mulching and watering shall be included on the plan.
(4)
Canopy Credit for Tree(s) Planted to Meet Canopy Coverage
(a)
The area devoted to newly planted areas may be counted as part of the tree save area. The land devoted to tree save areas that is represented by newly planted trees will be calculated on the basis of the following credits for new trees. A planted large maturing overstory tree shall be counted as equivalent to one thousand four hundred square feet (1,400 sq. ft.) of canopy; a medium maturing overstory tree shall be counted as the equivalent of seven hundred and fifty square feet (750 sq. ft.) of canopy; and a small maturing understory tree shall be counted as the equivalent of three hundred square feet (300 sq. ft.) of canopy.

Chapter 8-4-9. - Standards of tree care management.
General Tree Care Management
a)
The City of Augusta shall have the authority to insist that all property owners treat or else allow the City to treat trees suffering from transmittable diseases or insect infestations which are on private property but are affecting the health of public trees on public property. If the disease infestation warrants drastic action to curb its spread to healthy public trees, the Augusta Planning & Development Department will notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners at their expense within thirty days after the date of service of letter. In the event of failure of the said owners to comply with this provision, the City shall have the authority to remove such trees and charge the cost of the removal on the property owners' property tax notice.
b)
In case of emergencies, such as windstorms, or other disasters, the removal of broken limbs or uprooted trees, using proper Best Management Practices (BMP) practices, shall be allowed during the emergency period so that the requirements of this Ordinance would in no way hamper private or public work to restore order to Augusta, Georgia. This work is to be done in accordance with the emergency standards as outlined by Augusta, Georgia.
c)
The City shall have the right to remove, or cause or order to be removed, any tree, or part thereof, which is in an unsafe condition, or which, by reason of its nature, obstructing the view of any street intersection, is injurious to sewers, electrical power lines, gas lines, water lines, or other public improvements, or is affected with any injurious fungus, insect or other pest, whether on public or private property. The Augusta Planning & Development Department will notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners at their expense within thirty days after the date of service of letter. In the event of failure of the said owners to comply with this provision, the City shall have the authority to remove such trees and charge the cost of the removal on the property owners' property tax notice.

The Augusta Tree Commission, in conjunction with the Director and a qualified International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist shall review annually and formulate, revise and administer changes in the IGO every three years, as needed, on current standards of arboriculture practices as it relates to tree care on public and private land.
The Tree Commission shall make provision for educating the public about trees and include (but not be limited to) an inventory of tree resources, standard planting practices, tree maintenance, tree replacement and tree cover specifications, and needed maintenance work complete with estimated cost and time schedules. The Tree Commission will coordinate and facilitate events for the City such as Arbor Day and is encouraged to be active and participate in events such as Earth Day and other community tree-related outreach or lecture events.
Tree Preservation/Protection Plan
(a)
A tree preservation/protection element shall be incorporated into the Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan that is a part of the permit for land disturbance, which incorporates current industry standards for tree preservation/protection for development of property and during site disturbance. A detail listing of preservation/protection plans are attached in the IGO manual.
Tree Pruning Standards
a)
All pruning on any tree required by this Ordinance shall be performed in strict compliance with the "American National Standards" as set forth in the ANSI A300 (Part 1) - 2008 Pruning, or current ANSI standards and ANSI Z133 Safety Standards. A copy of the standards is available at the Augusta Planning & Development Department for review or can be purchased at ANSI.org.
b)
Examples:
c)
Trees trimmed for clearance from utility lines shall be trimmed in such a manner, using current industry standards, as to provide clearance from lines for a designated period of time or cycle, not to exceed three (3) years. In all cases where conditions permit, directional pruning or side trimming methods shall be used to obtain necessary clearance. Topping is prohibited.
Topping of Trees:
It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm, or city department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property. Topping is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches (3") in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempted from this Ordinance at the determination of the Tree Commission or their designee(s).)
"Tree Topping" means the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs of three (3) inches or more in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Tree Commission should reference the (ANSI 2133.1 - 2000) document as it applies to Tree Topping.
Standard Branch Definitions
topping: Reduction of tree size using internodal cuts without regard to tree health or structural integrity. Topping is not an acceptable pruning practice
Tree Removal Standards:
a)
A Permit is required for removal of all public and protected trees.
b)
Removal shall follow all current ANSI Z133 standards for safety.
c)
Stump removal On Public Property.
The stump and root flares of all removed trees shall be ground to a depth of at least eight-inches (8") below the ground level so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the ground. All grindings shall be removed and the soil cavity shall be filled with clean topsoil and the area leveled and seeded. If the area where the tree is removed is to be paved, the stump shall be removed to a suitable depth to allow adequate paving.
Tree Planting Standards:
a)
All trees planting shall be conducted in accordance with the most recent Arboricultural Specifications and Standards of Practice of the International Society of Arboriculture as published in the American National Standard for Tree Care Operations (ANSI 300 — Part 5 & 6) and herein referenced in this Article, and the Augusta IGO manual.
b)
All planted trees shall have a minimum tree establishment zone based upon its mature size (Table No.1). Refer to the tree species list located in the Augusta IGO manual for information on the size and tree quality rating for a specific species. No one species shall make up over fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of trees planted on the development site.

(a)
Removal of landmark trees on public property. "All located and designated (whether by signage or not) Landmark Trees"
(1)
A person requesting to remove a Landmark tree must obtain a permit from the Planning and Development Department by Tree Commission before the tree removal activities commence. A start date for removal must be given. Owners and persons who remove a Landmark Tree without a permit are subject to the civil penalties set out in Chapter 8-4-19. For purposes of this Ordinance, a Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan approved by the City and issued a Land Disturbing Permit constitutes a permit. Permits for the removal of Landmark trees will be granted only where:
•
The tree is located in the buildable area or yard area where a structure or improvement may be placed and there is no other reasonable location and/or preservation would unreasonably restrict use of the property.
•
The tree is diseased, injured, in danger of falling, creates unsafe sight distance or conflicts with other sections of this Ordinance or provisions of other ordinances or regulations.
•
Mitigation for each healthy Landmark tree removed will require replanting with designated trees from the approved planting list that meet the canopy square footage removed.
(b)
Replacement of landmark trees.
(1)
When a Landmark tree(s) is removed from a site during construction, or dies within five (5) years following construction, the developer shall replace such tree on the subject property with an amount of trees and/or landscaping of equal value. Valuation of the tree removed or lost shall be determined by the Director of Planning and Development Department in consultation with a person qualified by training or experience to have expert knowledge of the subject. Valuation of trees and vegetation shall be established in accordance with standards established by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers (CTLA).
(2)
If replacement isn't feasible or desired on the subject property, as determined by the Director, a monetary sum equal to the value, as determined by an ISA certified arborist based on the ISA Trunk Formula Method of Appraisal, of the lost or removed Landmark Tree(s) may be paid to a tree-planting fund (hereinafter known as the Tree Mitigation Fund) maintained by the Augusta Commission for the purposes of planting and maintaining trees throughout the jurisdiction of the City.

Site Plans that require grading only (no construction of improvements) may be exempt from providing Minimum Canopy Requirement of development at the discretion of the Director; however a streetyard must be installed per 8-4-13(d)(5) and required side and rear buffers shall be installed per 8-4-13(d)(9) and 8-4-13(d)(10), except for silviculture operations. Note: Grading/land disturbance activities that result in violations of state water buffers may result in civil penalties.
If water is not available onsite, water must be extended to the property to meet the irrigation requirement of this Ordinance,
(3)
Telecommunication facilities in LI or HI zoning unless the site is in view of a residential use in a residential zone, as viewed from the base of the tower.
(4)
Federal, State and local government utility infrastructure (water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer) projects only.
(c)
Tree protection/tree establishment plan required. Except as herein provided, there shall be a Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan for every development requiring a Site Plan. Such Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan shall include a tree survey/inventory, a tree establishment element, a tree protection element, and a landscaping element.
(d)
Landscape element design principles and standards.
(1)
A minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the total land area of any development shall be devoted to tree canopy. (All Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan designs shall follow the thirty percent (30%) Minimum Canopy Requirements of this Ordinance.)
(2)
No artificial plants, trees, or like materials shall be counted toward meeting the standards of these regulations.
(3)
All retained or planted trees shall be protected or situated so as to prevent damage from environmental changes (such as a lowered water table) or land disturbance resulting from any building or facility construction or site grading/land disturbance.
(4)
Sidewalks, curbing, or any other paved or impermeable surfaces within the greenspace area shall not count towards the thirty percent (30%) minimum canopy requirement or the street yard requirement.
(5)
A streetyard area shall be provided along any existing or proposed public street right-of-way or private right-of-way adjacent to or adjoining the property except for those portions of the lot used for driveways. Detention or retention ponds at the front of the property near the right-of-way do not relieve the developer from installing the required street yard.
For site plans that include fewer than one hundred (100) total parking and loading spaces, the minimum width of the streetyard shall be ten feet (10') and the streetyard shall be that area immediately adjacent to the right-of-way. Street yards shall be landscaped and properly maintained by the owner and shall have live vegetation including groundcover, grass, trees, shrubs and may, unless otherwise prohibited, include fences and walls and plantings for parking areas. Each street yard shall have at least one (1) large tree for each forty-five linear feet on center (45' o.c.) of street frontage, with a large tree being located within twenty feet (20') of each side property line. All planted trees must be a minimum of eight feet (8') in height, be at least three inches (3") in caliper, have a single trunk, and be unbranched to six feet (6').
In zoning districts where zero setbacks are permitted by the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance for structures adjoining public street rights-of-way, the street yard and its plantings may be located upon the public property if approved by the Engineering Department. In all other cases, the street yard must be located on private property.
For site plans that include one hundred (100) or more total parking and loading spaces, the minimum width of the streetyard shall be fifteen feet (15') and the streetyard shall be that area immediately adjacent to the right-of-way.
When a use of land is intensified or expanded in such a way that the required parking must be increased more than twenty percent (20%) (except for parking areas where a twenty percent (20%) increase would be less than five (5) new spaces) then the entire site including the already developed area must be provided with a street yard. The minimum width of the streetyard shall be five feet (5') and the streetyard shall be that area immediately adjacent to the right-of-way.
Where a property adjoins a right-of-way such as gas, power, railroad, etc., that is adjacent to and parallel with a public or private street, the subject property shall be deemed to front on the public or private street and streetyard requirements shall be adhered to.
When a major subdivision (ten (10) lots or more) of property occurs along an existing or proposed public street, a streetyard ten feet (10') in width, adjacent to the right-of-way, shall be installed and have at least one (1) large tree for each forty-five linear feet on center (45') of street frontage, with a large tree being located within twenty feet (20') of each side property line. All planted trees must be at least three inches (3") in caliper, have a single trunk, and be unbranched to six feet (6). Streetyards shall be landscaped and properly maintained by the owner and shall have live vegetation, groundcover, grass, trees, shrubs, and may, unless otherwise prohibited, include fences and walls and plantings for parking areas.
In areas, where overhead power lines conflict with the planting of the required streetyard, trees from the approved list, "Trees to be Planted Under Power Lines", may be utilized and shall be installed to have at least one (1) tree for each thirty linear feet on center (30' o.c.) of street frontage, with a tree being located within fifteen feet (15') of each side property line.
As of January 2003, any existing streetyard tree may not be cut or removed without permission of the Director.
(6)
Parking lots providing over five (5) spaces shall contain interior landscaped areas. This section shall apply to any surface parking lot or loading area or vehicular service area or portions thereof built after the adoption of this Ordinance. The number, size, and shape of interior tree planting islands areas shall be at the discretion of the owner subject to the following provisions:
(a)
A minimum of five percent (5%) of the total interior area of parking lots, loading areas, and vehicular use areas shall be devoted to tree planting islands areas. A single island size shall be a minimum of 8'x18' (144 sq. ft.) measured inside of curb to inside of curb. Required street yards may not count toward the five percent (5%). There shall be no more than twelve (12) consecutive parking spaces in any row between planting islands, which must contain a large tree, and which must be at least one hundred forty-four (144) square feet in area with a minimum width of eight feet (8') measured inside of curb to inside of curb. On such site plans one of every five (5) required planting islands must be a minimum of thirty six feet (36) in length and eight feet (8') in width, inside of curbing, unless all parking spaces are arranged around the perimeter of the parking lot. When row parking is utilized, the end of each row of parking must be a double planting island with a minimum of one large tree per row of parking (two trees per island).
The soils within tree planting islands shall be clean and free from debris, loose from compaction and with the proper soil mix for planting.
When a use of land is intensified or expanded in such a way that the required parking must be increased more than fifty percent (50%) (except for where such an increase would be less than twenty (20) spaces), the new parking area must conform to the requirements of this subsection and the already developed parking area must be retrofitted with planting islands at a rate of one for every twelve (12) which is no less than one hundred square feet (100 sq. ft.) in area and with a minimum width of eight feet (8').
All internal planting areas shall be landscaped with approved plant materials compatible with accepted arboricultural practices as set forth in the IGO. The area devoted to interior planting islands may be deducted from the required parking area pursuant to Section 4-2 of the Zoning Ordinance at a rate of one (1) space per two hundred square feet (200 sq. ft.) of planting island except that the requirement of spaces shall not be reduced over ten percent (10%).
Note: Pedestrian aisles and handicap aisles count as one or more parking spaces, based on width, for the purposes of calculating consecutive parking spaces.
As of January 1, 2003, any existing parking lot tree may not be cut or removed without permission of the Director.
(b)
No parking space shall be further than sixty five feet (65') from the trunk of a large tree with no intervening building.
(c)
Within existing parking areas, all new curbing around landscaped islands shall match existing curbing within the site. If no curbing is present within the site, then concrete curb and gutter, per City of Augusta standards and specifications, shall be used around landscaped islands.

(9)
Where the rear property line in a multiple-family residential, professional, commercial or industrial zone abuts an R (Residential) zone or single-family residence, a buffer strip not less than twenty feet (20') in width shall be provided. Further, where the rear property line in a commercial zone abuts an A (Agricultural), R-MH (Residential Manufactured Home), R-2 (Two-family Residential), or R-3 (Multi-family Residential) zone or single-family residence within one of these zones, a buffer strip not less than twenty feet (20') in width shall be provided. This buffer strip shall be designed to provide a year-round visual screen that is at least eight feet (8') in height and completely blocks the view of the subject property by a person standing just across the property line on the adjoining residential property. It shall consist of six foot (6') solid board or 'shadowbox' style fence or masonry wall that has two finished sides and is approved by the Tree Commission, unless a fence already exists on the adjoining property that meets the requirements of this Ordinance. The buffer strip shall be planted with medium or large trees spaced on forty-five (45') centers with interplanted evergreen plant material, berms, mounds or combinations thereof to achieve the objective within a maximum three (3) year period. No buildings, structures, storage of materials, or parking shall be permitted within this buffer area. Buffer areas shall be maintained and kept free of all debris, rubbish and weeds.
As of January 2003, any existing rear bufferyard tree may not be cut or removed without permission of the Director.
(10)
Where the side property line in a multiple-family, professional, commercial, or industrial zone abuts an R (Residential) zone or single-family residence, a planted buffer strip not less than ten feet (10') in width shall be provided. Further, where the side property line in a commercial zone abuts an A (Agricultural), R-MH (Residential Manufactured Home), R-2 (Two-family Residential), or R-3 (Multi-family Residential) zone or single-family residence within one of these zones, a buffer strip not less than twenty feet (20') in width shall be provided. This buffer strip shall be designed to provide a year-round visual screen that is at least eight feet (8') in height and completely blocks the view of the subject property by a person standing just across the property line on the adjoining residential property. Said buffer strip shall begin at the front setback line and extend along the entire remaining side boundary. It shall consist of a six foot (6') solid board or shadowbox" style fence or masonry wall that has two finished sides and is approved by the Tree Commission, unless a fence already exists on the adjoining property that meets the requirements of this Ordinance.

(e)
Tree protection and tree establishment elements.
Land cleared for development or land being proposed for development shall have, after development, not less than thirty percent (30%) Minimum Canopy Requirements of total area being developed.-Minimum Canopy Requirements shall only be calculated on the acreage of the site that is being developed. Undeveloped portions of the site shall not be required to provide Minimum Canopy Requirements (including street yard requirements) nor shall Minimum Canopy Requirements for existing trees on undeveloped portions of the site be counted toward the requirements of the developed portion of the site. Tree protection and tree establishment elements may be provided separately or collectively depending on the nature, complexity, and scale of the development.
Such elements shall be included on the Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan:
(1)
Existing tree cover and tree cover that is to be removed.
(2)
The location and species of all trees to be retained on the developed portion of the site for which Minimum Canopy Requirements are to be claimed, including their DBH, health, and their tree protection zones. Where a grouping or cluster of twenty (20) or more trees is located within a proposed tree protection zone, the location of individual trees within such cluster is not required to be spotted on the Plan, provided the number of trees for each species within the cluster is given and the average DBH is identified for each species. Existing trees on undeveloped portions of the site (i.e. future development) or trees within the right-of-way(s) cannot be counted toward Minimum Canopy Requirements.
(3)
The location, species, and DBH of all trees located on adjacent rights-of-way.
(4)
A listing in chart form of all trees to be planted on the site for which Minimum Canopy Requirements are to be claimed, giving their respective species, caliper, and mature spread.
(5)
A description of tree planting specifications if different from those listed in the Illustrated Guide to Implementing the Augusta Tree Ordinance (IGO).
IGO and any amendments thereto are hereby adopted by reference. The guide will be reviewed annually by the Tree Commission with the updated version being adopted by reference and each time made a part hereof. All Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plans shall be provided in a manner consistent with provisions contained therein.
As of January 2003, any existing tree that would count toward the overall requirement for Minimum Canopy Requirements may not be cut or removed without permission of the Director.
(f)
Tree protection and tree establishment standards. Tree protection zones shall be established and maintained for all trees preserved or planted on a site for which Minimum Canopy Requirements are to be claimed. The following provisions apply to such zones and the trees within them.
(1)
The tree protection zone shall have a dimension of not less than one-half (½) the distance to the dripline of the preserved tree, or the minimum tree protection zones for planted trees set forth in Table 1; whichever is greater. Tree protection zones shall be barricaded prior to the commencement of construction and until the Certificate of Occupancy has been issued.
(2)
The area within any tree protection zone must remain open and unpaved. The use of perforated pavement may be allowed subject to the approval of the Director.

Chapter 8-4-14. - Compliance.
All improvements shown in the Tree Protection/Tree Establishment Plan shall be constructed and all plant materials shall be in place and approved by Augusta before a Certificate of Occupancy will be issued for any use of land or structure(s) that is not exempted from this Ordinance. If at the time of request for a Certificate of Occupancy the required landscaping is not in place and it can be determined Augusta personnel that unavailability of plant materials or that weather conditions prohibit completion of this planting, then the developer may, at the discretion of the Director, provide an executed contract binding until December 31 of the calendar year in which the application is made that provides for the completion of such landscaping work, and also a Performance Guarantee or an Irrevocable Letter of Credit from a federally insured lender in an amount to be approved by Augusta Planning & Development commensurate with the cost of completing the required landscaping.
Existing trees or other landscape features as delineated on previously approved Site Plans and subsequently installed to conform with the minimum standards of this Ordinance may not be removed or altered without prior approval of the Planning Director.
In the event that trees cannot be planted on the site or in the proper location on the site (example: streetyard trees or parking island trees) due to hardship, a variance of the Tree Commission may be applied for. The variance request shall include: the variance fee, as set forth by Augusta, GA, a letter explaining the need for the variance, a mitigation package at a rate of two trees for every tree not planted on the site, (trees will be planted at another location on the site or at a location as set forth by the Augusta Tree Commission), and a Tree Establishment Bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) per tree in the mitigation package. If trees are to be planted offsite, installation of the trees will be the developer's responsibility, and maintenance for a three-year term, from the date that the trees are planted will also be the developer's responsibility. A Maintenance Agreement outlining proper care of trees to be planted offsite will also be required for a term of three years, unless waived by the Augusta Tree Commission. In lieu of the mitigation package, a fee in the amount of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) per tree to be mitigated shall be payable to Augusta Georgia, and deposited in a separate Tree Landscaping Account (hereinafter referred to as the "Tree Bank" or the "Tree Mitigation Fund"), for placement of or replacement of trees within the City. A Tree Establishment Bond nor a Maintenance Agreement will be required if this option is exercised.
The primary objective of the Tree Bank/Tree Mitigation Fund is to use payments for the installation and maintenance of trees on public property. The City shall also use all such payments for the cost associated with implementation of this Ordinance, for City sponsored tree management/tree education programs, and for the study, inventory, maintenance or treatment of public trees requiring the services of a Certified Arborist or other qualified consultant with the approval of the Director. Mitigation funds will not be used in lieu of General Fund support for the existing urban forest management program.

Chapter 8-4-15. - Tree establishment bond.
A three-year Tree Establishment Bond shall be posted with the Augusta Planning & Development Department prior to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. This bond shall be in the amount of the contract award for landscaping or in an amount determined by the Augusta Planning & Development Department, whichever is higher. After thirty (30) months, Augusta Planning & Development staff shall inspect the site and make a determination as to whether or not the required trees and landscaping have not been removed, the required trees and landscaping are healthy, the growth and the integrity of the required trees have not been compromised, the canopy of the required trees have not been reduced in any fashion, and the required trees have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such a finding, the bond shall be released at the end of the three-year Tree Establishment Bond period. In absence of such a finding, the Tree Establishment Bond shall not be released and the owner/developer of the property shall be notified to replace the unhealthy trees and landscaping or take other appropriate action as required by Augusta Planning & Development staff. If the owner/developer fails to comply with the decision of Augusta Planning & Development staff within sixty (60) days of receiving a written notice, then the City shall use the Tree Establishment Bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance with the provisions of these regulations.

The mitigation authorized by this Chapter of the Ordinance is not meant to supplant good site planning. Tree replacement will be considered only after all design alternatives which could save more existing trees have been evaluated.
a.
Mitigation through planting new replacement trees.
•
A sufficient number and diameter of replacement trees shall be planted in order to equal the total diameter inches or fraction thereof of trees six inches (6") or greater and slated for removal. Replacement trees shall be a minimum of three inches (3") diameter when measured six inches (6") above the soil line and a minimum of eight feet (8') in height when planted and unbranched to 6' or as exempted by the IGO.

Replacement trees should be planted on the site from which existing trees are to be removed. If this is not feasible, an applicant may initiate a proposal to plant trees offsite. This proposal has to be approved by the Planning Director.
•
Replacement trees shall be planted prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy or project release. Optimum planting times do not always correspond to project completion.
