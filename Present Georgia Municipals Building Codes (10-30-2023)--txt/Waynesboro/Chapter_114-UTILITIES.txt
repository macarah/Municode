(a)
Prohibited discharge standards.
(1)
General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
(2)
Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
a.
Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Centigrade) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
b.
Wastewater having a pH of 5.5 or less or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment. If a continuous pH chart recorder is being used, any occurrence of pH over 9.5 but less than 10.5 for a period of 30 minutes or more per day is prohibited. Any occurrence of pH between 10.5 and 11.0 for more than 15 minutes per day is prohibited. Any pH occurrence over 11.0 is prohibited. If a continuous pH chart recorder is not being used, any occurrence of pH over 9.5 is prohibited. At no time shall any discharge cause the pH of the influent at the POTW head works to go above 9.5 or cause structural damage.
c.
Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case solids greater than one half-inch or 256 centimeters in any dimension.
d.
Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW.
e.
Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Centigrade) which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Centigrade) unless the approval authority, upon the request of the POTW, approves alternate temperature limits.
f.
Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in excess of five mg/l or in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.
g.

  The above limits normally apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of the pipe). The city may impose a local limit at the end of a process prior to dilution with other waste streams. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The city manager may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the above concentration-based limitations. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply.
(e)
City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(f)
Special agreement. The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13.
(g)
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city manager may impose mass limitations on users that he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(h)
Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this article within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the city manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this article.
(i)
Deadline for compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements.
(1)
Compliance by existing users (categorical users) covered by categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than EPA's categorical pretreatment standards.
(2)
New source discharges and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.
(3)
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in noncompliance with any local limits, shall be provided with a compliance schedule placed in an industrial wastewater permit to insure compliance with the shortest time feasible.
(j)
Additional pretreatment measures.
(1)
Whenever deemed necessary, the city manager may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
(2)
The city manager may require any user discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on his property and at his expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. The facility shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the city manager. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
(3)
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the city manager and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at his expense.
(4)
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(k)
Accidental discharge/slug control. The city manager may require any user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An accidental spill prevention plan/slug control (ASPP) plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within a specific number of days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of section.
(1)
Any user required to develop and implement an ASPP shall submit a plan that addresses, at a minimum, the following:
a.
Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
b.
Description of stored chemicals;
c.
Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the standards in subsections (a) through (d) of this section; and
d.
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(2)
Users shall notify city wastewater treatment plant personnel immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug" or "accidental discharge" of substances regulated by this article. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof under state or federal law.
(3)
Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the city manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
(4)
Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures.
(l)
Hauled or septic tank wastes.
(1)
Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at receiving structures designated by the city, and at such time as are established by the city manager. Such wastes must not violate this article or any other requirements established or adopted by the city. The city manager may require wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities.
(2)
Septage haulers may only discharge loads at locations specifically designated by the city manager. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the city manager. The city manager may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. The city manager may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
(3)
Septage haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste.
(4)
The city manager may allow hauled industrial waste under special circumstances and on a case-by-case basis. Under no circumstances shall the city allow RCRA defined hazardous wastes.
(5)
Fees for dumping hauled wastes will be established as part of the user fee system as authorized in section 114-189.

The City of Waynesboro will perform all sewer repairs, installation, and maintenance. Sewer work shall be performed by the city unless a department head deems the job unsafe or the job is too large for the city's staff. If the department head deems the job unsafe or too large, the city will contract it out to a utility contractor of the city's choice.
b.
The owner or the owner's agent shall make an application on a special form furnished by the city building inspector. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information as considered pertinent in the judgment of the city manager. A permit and inspection fee as specified elsewhere shall be paid at the time the application is filed.
c.
New construction of a sewer tap line will be subject to a fee, paid in advance by the property owner to the city. The advance fee for the issuance of a permit to tap the city sewer lines, shall equal the cost of the installation of the tap, as laid out in subsection 114-48(a).
d.
All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be paid by the property owner. The property owner is responsible for all costs and expenses for all portions of the sewer line measured from the tap to the residence, building or dwelling. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damages that may directly or indirectly occur as a result of the installation, repairs, excavation, replacement, connections, securing the pipe and tapping, as well as recovering the area that was excavated, on both the homeowner's property and the city's property. The city will inspect the completed work to ensure it is in compliance with established city and state codes and guidelines before and after the street repair. The city shall not have ownership for the building sewers and connections nor responsibility for maintenance of the building sewers and connections.
e.
Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the building inspector, to meet all requirements of this article.
f.
The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer and the methods to be used in construction shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the county. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within the city's supervision:
1.
The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revision, or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron pipe, or ductile iron pipe with bolted mechanical joints as may be required by the building inspector where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots.

Installation of gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer.
(iv)
Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the building inspector.
6.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45 degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the building inspector.
g.
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall that might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
h.
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sewer unless such connection is approved for purposes of disposal or polluted surface drainage.
i.
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the building inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the building inspector or his representative.
j.

l.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the building inspector before installation.
m.
In the event a house sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow, the city or its appointed agency may:
1.
Require the owner to repair the house sewer;
2.
Charge the owner a sewer rate that reflects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property;
3.
Require the owner to disconnect his sewer from the city sewer system.
(3)
Restricted use of the public sewers.
a.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated above and which, in the judgment of the city, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may:

(a)
Final compliance report (initial compliance report).
(1)
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the significant industrial user with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in this article, in a wastewater discharge permit, or within 30 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new source or new users considered by the city to fit the definition of SIU, the affected user shall submit to the city a report containing the information outlined in subsections (4)d through f of this section.
(2)
For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period.
(b)
Periodic compliance report.
(1)
Any user that is required to have an industrial waste discharge permit and performs self-monitoring shall submit to the city during the months of June and December, unless required on other dates or more frequently by the city, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over the previous reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed within the industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users shall sample their discharge at least twice per year.
(2)
The report shall include a record of the concentrations (and mass if specified in the wastewater discharge permit) of the pollutants listed in the wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of all flow measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling locations, and shall also include any additional information required by this article or the wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported if required by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required by the city or by this article, using methodologies in 40 CFR 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.
(3)
Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city or by unit production limits specified in the applicable categorical standards shall report production data as outlined in subsection (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or non-regulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the regulated process flows, dilution flows and non-regulated flows.
(5)
Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement; provided, however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual measurement is not feasible.
(6)
Sampling shall be representative of the user's daily operations and shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified in section 114-180.
(7)
The city may require reporting by users that are not required to have an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is needed to establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent or determine any other factor that is related to the operation and maintenance of the sewer system.
(8)
The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if requested by the user, may agree to perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to prepare the periodic compliance report required under this section. If the city agrees to perform such periodic compliance monitoring, it may charge the user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer charge and shall be payable as part of the sewer bills. The city is under no obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user.
(c)
Compliance schedules for meeting applicable pretreatment standards.
(1)
The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).
(2)
No increment referred to in subsection (c)(1) of this section shall exceed nine months.
(3)
Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports.
(d)
Notification of significant production changes. Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the city within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not providing a notice of such anticipated change will be required to comply with the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge permit.
(e)
Hazardous waste notification.
(1)
Any user that is discharging 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide a one time notification in writing to the city, EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, Georgia Environmental Protection Division Director. Any existing user exempt from this notification shall comply with the requirements contained herein within 30 days of becoming aware of a discharge of 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes in a calendar month or the discharge of acutely hazardous wastes to the city sewer system.
(2)
Such notification shall include:
a.
The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261;
b.
The EPA hazardous waste number; and
c.
The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other);
d.
If an industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar per month to the sewer system, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily available to the industrial user:
1.
An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes;
2.
An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste streams discharged during that calendar month; and
3.
An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste streams expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
(3)
These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements.
(4)
Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the city of the discharge of such a substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(5)
In the case of any notification made under this subsection (e), an industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(f)
Notice of potential problems, including accidental spills, slug loadings. Any user shall notify the city immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined in section 114-176(c). The notification shall include the concentration and volume and corrective action. Steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact should also be noted during the notification. Any user who discharges a "slug" (or slugs) of pollutants shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city under state or federal law.
(g)
Noncompliance reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling within five days and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the user is not required to resample if:
(1)
The city performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month; or
(2)
The city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(h)
Notification of changed discharge. All users shall promptly notify the city manager in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including significant manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
(i)
Total toxic organic (TTO) reporting. Categorical users which are required by EPA to eliminate and/or reduce the levels of total toxic organics (TTOs) discharged into the sewer system must follow the categorical pretreatment standards for that industry. Those users must also meet the following requirements:
(1)
Must sample without exception, as part of the application requirements, for all the organics listed under the TTO limit.
(2)
No TTO's used at the facility or the user elects to develop a solvent management plan in lieu of continuously monitoring for TTO.
(3)
The user must routinely submit a certification statement as part of its self-monitoring report that there has been no dumping of concentrated toxic organic into the wastewater and that it is implementing a solvent management plan as approved by the city. Facilities who have sampled initially and can verify that there are no toxic organics utilized may not have to develop a solvent management plan, but must make the certification statement of no use of toxic organics during the reporting period.
(j)
Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the city manager may require.
(k)
Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the persons taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or POTW, or when the city manager specifically notifies a user of a longer retention period.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 4, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 114-180. - Sampling and analytical requirements.
(a)
Sampling requirements for users.
(1)
A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. The city manager will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the user will be able to composite the individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow-proportional is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
(2)
Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exists or immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the city and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standards.
(3)
All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of its self-monitoring report.
(b)
Analytical requirements. All pollutants analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
(c)
City monitoring of user's wastewater. The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 5, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 114-181. - Compliance monitoring.
(a)
Inspections and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article, and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the city manager and his designees ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
(1)
Where a user has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city manager or designee will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
(2)
The city manager or designee shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
(3)
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.
(4)
Unreasonable delays in allowing the city manager or designee access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
(b)
Monitoring facilities.
(1)
Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The city manager, whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (e.g., at the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater treatment system).
(2)
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
(3)
All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
(4)
The city manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(c)
Search warrants. If the city manager or designee has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city manager shall seek issuance of a search warrant from the Superior Court of Burke County or other appropriate court. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the city manager in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 6, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 117-182. - Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 7, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 114-183. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The city shall publish annually, in the local legal organ published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users, which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
(1)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria. This does not include measurements for pH;
(3)
Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public;
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8)
Any other violations the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 8, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 114-184. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
(a)
Notification of violation. When the city manager or his designee finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation (NOV). The NOV will require, within 15 days, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, to be submitted by the user to the city manager within a prescribed period of time. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(c)
Show cause meeting. The city manager may order a user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause meeting shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(d)
Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(e)
Cease and desist.
(1)
When the city manager finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
a.
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
b.
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(2)
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(f)
Administrative fines.
(1)
When the city manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine such user in an amount established by council, but not to exceed $1,000.00. The basis for such fines shall be assessed per violation, per day. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2)
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 90 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of seven percent of the unpaid balance. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(3)
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 14 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager shall convene a hearing on the matter within 14 days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(4)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(g)
Emergency suspensions.
(1)
The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
a.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user.
b.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (c) and (h) of this section.
(2)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(h)
Termination of discharge (non-emergency).
(1)
Any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
a.
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
b.
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
c.
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
d.
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or
e.
Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 114-177.
(2)
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 9, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 114-185. - Judicial enforcement remedies.
(a)
Injunctive relief. When the city manager finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may petition the Superior Court of Burke County through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(b)
Civil penalties.
(1)
A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(2)
The city manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
(3)
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(4)
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(c)
Criminal prosecution.
(1)
A user which has willfully or negligently violated any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.
(2)
A user which has willfully or negligently introduced any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 and/or be subject to imprisonment for six months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
(3)
A user which knowingly made any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsified, tampered with, or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for six months, or both.
(4)
In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation per day, or imprisonment for six months, or both.
(d)
Remedies non-exclusive. The provisions in sections 114-183 through 114-186 are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-2001, § 10, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 114-186. - Supplemental enforcement action.
(a)
Performance bonds. The city manager may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the city manager to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(b)
Liability insurance. The city manager may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
(c)
Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(d)
Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, may be declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the city manager. Any person creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of this Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
(e)
Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements may be considered not eligible to receive any contractual or bid award for the sale of goods or services to the city. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the city held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of the city.
(Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 11, 8-5-2002)
Sec. 114-187. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Upset.
(1)
For the purposes of this section, the term "upset," means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(b)
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 114-177(a)(1) and (2)c through g if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES and/or other disposal system permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(c)
Bypass.
(1)
For the purposes of this section:
a.
The term "bypass" means the intentional division of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
a.
Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
1.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
2.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
3.
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (3) of this section.
b.
The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)a of this section.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Air gap separation means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying pure water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the rim of the receptacle.
Auxiliary water system means any water system on or available to the premises other than the water works, which may include, but is not limited to, other purveyors water works, wells, lakes, streams, process fluids or used water. Auxiliary water system maybe polluted, contaminated, objectionable or constitute a system over which the water purveyor has no control.
Backflow means a reverse flow of contaminants, pollution, process fluids, used water, untreated water, chemicals, gases, nonpotable water into any part of a water system.
Backflow prevention means a program designed to prevent backflow into the potable water systems and to discover, to eliminate, and to prevent all uncontrolled cross-connections, existing or potential.
Backflow prevention device means a device designed to prevent reverse flow in a water system. The term "backflow prevention" will be used in reference to an approved or listed device by one of the recognized testing agencies.
Backpressure means an increase in pressure in a consumer's water system, or a branch of the system, above that at the service-connection. It is generally caused by pumps, thermal expansion, or reasons other than a reduction or loss of the incoming pressure. Backpressure is generally more evident in a closed water system.
Backsiphonage means a reverse flow in a water system caused by a negative pressure in the incoming pipe, when the point of use is at atmospheric pressure. Backsiphonage is generally more evident in an open water system.
Closed water system means one with a checking device installed in the service pipe. A check valve, backflow preventer, or pressure reducing valve would create a closed system.
Consumer means the owner or person in control of any premises supplied by or in any manner connected to a waterworks.
Consumer's water system means all potable water piping, valves, fittings and appurtenances on the premises side of the service-connection. It is the secondary component of a public water system.

Containment backflow prevention means the installation of a backflow preventer at the service-connection to premises to protect the water main primarily (the second line of defense).
Contamination means any introduction into pure water of microorganisms, wastes, wastewater, undesirable chemicals, or gases.
Cross-connection means a physical connection or arrangement between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains potable water, the other nonpotable fluid, or water of unknown quality, where there could be backflow into the potable system unless it is protected by an appropriate backflow prevention device.
Cross-connection means any connection or structural arrangement, direct or indirect, to the waterworks whereby backflow can occur.
Cross-connection control (isolation) means the installation of a backflow preventer at each cross-connection on a premises for protection at the point of use (the first line of defense).
Cross-connection inspector means a person qualified and authorized to make internal inspections for uncontrolled plumbing cross-connections, to prescribe means for controlling same, and who has proved his competency to the applicable regulatory agency(ies).
Degree of hazard is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to health and the adverse effect upon the waterworks.
Double detector check backflow preventer (DDC-BFP) means a backflow prevention device designed to serve also as a detector check on fire protection systems where pollutants are involved.

Open water system means one with no checking device installed in the service pipe. Water from the consumer's system is free to backflow into the main, for whatever reason.
Pollutant means any substance that, if introduced into the potable water system, could be objectionable but could not create a health hazard.
Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance (chemical, physical, radiological, or biological) in water that tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute an unnecessary risk or impair the usefulness of the water.
Pollution hazard means a condition through which an aesthetically objectionable or degrading material may enter the waterworks or a consumer's water system.
Pressure type cross-connection means an installation where a potable water pipe is connected to a closed vessel, or a piping system, that contains a nonpotable fluid, and is above atmospheric pressure.
Process fluids means any fluid or solution that may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted which would constitute a health, pollutional, or system hazard introduced into the waterworks. This includes, but not limited to:
