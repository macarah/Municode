In all cases where the owner or operator of a motor vehicle which is on a public street has requested that the motor vehicle be left unattended at that location in lieu of the impoundment of the motor vehicle pursuant to section 98-111(1) and (3), the police officer may, in the police officer's discretion, honor the request for a period of time not exceeding 24 hours, after which time the motor vehicle shall be impounded if not removed by the owner or operator.

The owner of the impounded vehicle shall sign the notice as an acknowledgment that a copy has been received, and a copy of the notice shall be provided to the owner.
(b)
