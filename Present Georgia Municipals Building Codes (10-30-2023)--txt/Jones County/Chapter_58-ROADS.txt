--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 200902-1o, adopted Feb. 3, 2009, deleted Art. II in its entirety and enacted a new Art. II to read as set out herein. Former Art. II pertained to culvert installation policy and derived from an ordinance adopted Sept. 15, 1998; and an ordinance adopted Jan. 7, 2003.

Sec. 58-31. - Permit required.
Prior to installing a new driveway or private roadway leading to or from public roads of Jones County, the owners of said private roadways or driveways shall apply for a permit from the county public works department or its designated agent. The application fee for the permit is $35.00 and is non-refundable.
(Ord. No. 200902-1o, 2-3-2009)
Sec. 58-32. - Design criteria for driveways.
Driveways must be designed to prevent excess water from entering the public roads of the county and, if required by the public works director or his designated agent, the property owner must take whatever action is necessary to satisfy this requirement before a permit is issued.
(Ord. No. 200902-1o, 2-3-2009)
Sec. 58-33. - Inspection.
The public works director or his designated agent shall inspect the proposed driveway or private roadway location prior to the commencement of any construction related to the new driveway or private roadway. The director or his agent shall determine what size of culvert, if any, will be required for the area located within the county's right-of-way.
(Ord. No. 200902-1o, 2-3-2009)
Sec. 58-34. - Minimum dimensions.
All culverts installed on the county's right-of-way shall have a minimum diameter of 15 inches and a minimum length of 24 feet. Any exceptions to said measurements must be approved by the public works director or his designated agent.
(Ord. No. 200902-1o, 2-3-2009)
Sec. 58-35. - Permit fees.
After the location of the new driveway or private roadway has been inspected by the public works director or his designated agent, the owner may obtain an approved driveway permit. If the public works director or his designated agent determine that a culvert shall not be required for the proposed location, no further charges shall be assessed. If a culvert is required within the county's right-of-way, a fee which includes the cost of materials and labor shall be charged in accordance with the current fee schedule as adopted by the Jones County Board of Commissioners. Once this fee has been paid, the public works department may install the culvert.
(Ord. No. 200902-1o, 2-3-2009)
Sec. 58-36. - Installation of culverts on the county's right-of-way.
Only the public works department may install culverts on the county's right-of-way for new driveways and private roadways that intersect public roads in Jones County. Any other method of installation is prohibited. If a culvert has been installed by someone other than the public works department, the public works director or his designated agent shall inspect the culvert to determine if it will need to be removed or if it can remain in place. If it is determined that the culvert is unacceptable, the property owner will need to remove the culvert immediately. If the public works director or his designated agent determines that the culvert is presenting an immediate threat to the public, the county will remove the culvert at the property owner's expense. If the culvert is determined to be acceptable, the property owner will still have to pay in full the fees as described in section 58-35, including the cost of the complete installation.
(Ord. No. 200902-1o, 2-3-2009)
Sec. 58-37. - Exemptions.
Nothing in this article shall apply to new subdivision roads that are intended for public use, or new private roads that are built to public road standards.
