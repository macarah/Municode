Sec. 18-1. - Statement of purpose and intent.
(a)
In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the city council not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to:
(1)
Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(2)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive land use planning;
(3)
Protect the public health, safety and welfare;
(4)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(5)
Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the city;
(6)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(7)
Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(8)
Promote economic development and tourism;
(9)
Protect private property values; and
(10)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
(b)
The city council has given careful consideration to the following studies, and find them to be relevant to the city, and useful in determining the proper regulation of the size, location and number of sign structures in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26).

(c)
In adopting these sign regulations, the city council has carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from state courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed.Appx. 900 (C.A. 11th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be accorded weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D. Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the city council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

These directives shall not be construed to require any permit for change of copy on any sign, replacement of the sign face, nor for the repainting, cleaning, or other normal maintenance or repair of a sign or sign structure for which a permit has previously been issued, so long as the sign or sign structure is not modified or enlarged in any way.
(b)

Provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of a sign that is prohibited by this chapter in the district in question. Such variance may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the city council that all of the following exists:
(1)
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
(2)
The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
(3)
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;
(4)
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; and

(b)
Request for variances and procedures for hearing shall be subject to the same procedures as requests for zoning amendments. The city council shall consider such request for a variance at a public meeting conducted within 35 days of the filing of a request.
(c)
Minor variance. When an applicant requests a variance for any numeric criteria required under this chapter by 20 percent or less, it shall be considered a minor variance. The planning commission shall be authorized to grant such minor variance upon a finding that the criteria listed in subsection (a) of this section are met. In such cases, the procedure required by subsection (b) of this section shall not apply. Instead, the applicant shall file an application with the city for a minor variance, and shall provide notice by certified mail addressed to the owners of record of each property adjacent to the property for which the minor variance is requested. Such notice shall include a copy of the application and the date, time and location of the public meeting at which the planning commission shall consider such request. The planning commission shall consider such variance and made its decision within 35 days of the request for a variance. Such notice shall be mailed not less than 21 days prior to the date of the public meeting, and proof of the mailing of such notice shall be filed with the city prior to the meeting of the planning commission. At such meeting, the applicant and any interested parties will be allowed a reasonable opportunity to address the planning commission prior to its rendering a decision. In the event any party is aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission, the decision may be appealed to the county superior court within 30 days of the planning commission's decision.
(d)
Fee. Each application for a variance shall pay a base fee as indicated on the master fee schedule to defray administrative and notification costs. Additional fees may be required as indicated on fee schedule set by the city council.
