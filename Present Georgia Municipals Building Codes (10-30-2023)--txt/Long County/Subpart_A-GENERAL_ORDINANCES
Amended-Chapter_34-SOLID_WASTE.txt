ARTICLE II. - COLLECTION

Sec. 34-25. - Solid waste drop-off sites and convenience centers.
(a)
In the interest of the public health, welfare, and safety, the county may designate special solid waste drop-off sites containing refuse containers, dumpsters, recycling containers, and inert waste disposal areas designated for household or residential waste for use by county citizens.
(b)
Such solid waste drop-off sites, refuse containers, or dumpsters, if any, shall be used in strict accordance with this chapter, and any and all regulations issued by the county board of commissioners.
(c)
The commission may designate areas in the county where dumpsters intended to be for public use may be located and maintained. These dumpsters shall be located on public property, along the right-of-way of public roads or streets, or on private property with the express written consent of the owner and tenant in legal possession of the property.
(d)
The county may operate appropriate convenience centers approved by the board of commissioners. Normally, a convenience center will provide bulk collection containers for household solid waste (putrescent), recyclables, yard waste on a specified scheduled basis, and large household items such as furniture and appliances on a specified basis. Each convenience center will have posted the hours of operation. It shall be the duty of the occupant or owner of any private residential unit to properly maintain all refuse pending disposal at one of the county-operated convenience centers.
(Ord. of 11-5-2001, § 4; Ord. of 11-6-2001, § 4; Ord. of 2-3-2004, § 4; Ord. of 4-18-2011, § 4)
Sec. 34-26. - Franchises; curbside collection.
(a)
No individual, partnership, corporation, or other entity shall collect and/or dispose of municipal solid waste for a fee without obtaining a franchise from the county governing authority.
(b)
In the event that the county governing authority grants an exclusive franchise, through a contract or other means, to an individual, partnership, corporation, or other entity for the purpose of providing curbside residential and/or commercial solid waste collection, all residents, either permanent or temporary, and commercial establishments within the unincorporated areas of the county must subscribe to the service. Mandatory subscription ensures that residential solid waste is properly collected and disposed of in a manner that protects the health and safety of county residents. Likewise, the franchisee is required to provide curbside collection services to all county residents, both permanent and temporary. For renter-occupied properties, as feasible, curbside residential solid waste collection fees will be billed to and collected from the owner of the property in the same manner as owner-occupied properties. Tenants of approved mobile home parks may be exempt from the mandatory subscription requirement, if the mobile home park owner and franchisee mutually agree to utilize dumpsters within the mobile home park, subject to other county ordinances. In this event, the mobile home park owner will pay for dumpster service under the terms of the franchise agreement.
(c)
In the event of an exclusive franchise, residents that do not compensate the franchisee for provided solid waste collection services are subject to termination of service. Because the county governing authority may be liable for outstanding subscriber collection fees, these fees may be collected through the county governing authority through the annual real property tax bill.
(d)
All residential solid waste, less bulky waste, yard trash, and other items prohibited by the franchisee, shall be placed in county-approved containers provided by the franchisee.
(e)
The county governing authority reserves the discretion and authority to grant, revoke, or rescind any franchise, in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the county citizens.
(f)
Prior to engaging in solid waste handling in the county, a franchisee must have obtained a solid waste handling permit from the director of the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources, or any successor agency authorized to issue permits pursuant to state law.
(g)
All franchisees must meet minimum insurance requirements as determined at the discretion of the county governing authority.
(h)
The franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the county, its officers, boards, commissions, employees, and agents, against any and all claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments from third parties for damages which may be a result of willful, negligent, or tortuous conduct arising out of the business of collection, transportation, or disposal of solid waste.
(i)
Franchisees shall provide an adequate number of vehicles for regular collection services, and these vehicles must conform to all applicable state laws and requirements of the state department of transportation and state department of natural resources.
(j)
The franchisee shall maintain, at its place of business, records showing the names and addresses of all property owners and tenants with whom the franchisee contracted for solid waste collection services, including street addresses of properties served. The franchisee shall submit, upon reasonable request of the county governing authority, to a customer audit.
(k)
All franchisees shall dispose of collected solid waste only at an approved, state-permitted disposal location.
(l)
In lieu of a franchise fee, the franchisee shall apply any ordinary annual fee payable to the county for any franchise granted, pursuant to this section, to reduce the cost of collection services for county residents.
(m)
The county governing authority at all times reserves the right to direct and control the time, place, and manner of solid waste collection and handling.
(n)
The franchisee will be required to provide back door collection services for disabled and elderly customers under certain conditions. Any person who is incapable of moving his refuse to the curbside shall obtain a physician's certificate as to such disability. The physician's certificate must be presented to the county clerk prior to the franchisee providing this service. Back door collection will only be provided if no other able-bodied adults reside with the disabled or elderly individuals requesting this service.

The solid waste is placed directly into refuse receptacles or containers, including dumpsters, installed on such property in accordance with this chapter.
(2)
In the case of private property, the person is the owner or tenant in lawful possession of such property, or has obtained consent of the owner or tenant in lawful possession, or unless the act is done under the personal direction of the owner or tenant, all in a manner consistent with the public welfare.
(b)
Any accumulation of litter or rubbish items on any lot, property, premises, public street, alley or other public or private place not permitted by this chapter is hereby declared to be a nuisance. Failure of the owner or occupant to remove and correct any such accumulation of refuse after appropriate notice from the board of commissioners or its designee shall raise the presumption that such person intended to violate this chapter.
(c)
Use of streets. It shall be unlawful for any vehicle transporting loose materials on any road or street to transport the materials without a suitable cover securely fastened to the vehicle, provided that the transported materials present a danger of falling from the vehicle. This subsection shall not apply to the transportation of poultry, livestock, silage or other feed grain used in the feeding of poultry or livestock.
(d)
Use of any county solid waste convenience drop-off sites, refuse containers, or dumpsters by commercial operators and/or for the disposal of any industrial or commercial waste, including, but not limited to, waste generated by building contractors or subcontractors, and tree surgeons or similar businesses, is unlawful and prohibited.

(i)
It shall be unlawful to place or deposit any garbage or household trash in dumpsters without first placing and securing such in a garbage bag of suitable strength and thickness. These bags will be available at each site for emergency use only at a cost that is economically feasible at the time of drop-off. These bags will be of strength which will not easily allow puncture allowing leakage of household consumable products.
