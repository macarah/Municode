ARTICLE II. - STREETLIGHTS

Sec. 14-20. - Declaration of policy and purpose.
The board of commissioners does hereby declare that it shall promote the health, safety and general public welfare of the citizens of the county by providing for the erection of streetlights in the public rights-of-way of the county. To that end, therefore, this article is adopted in order to effect the creation of streetlight districts and to provide for the construction of streetlights in the public rights-of-way in the county. This article shall not be deemed to apply to property in the county other than in the public rights-of-way.
(Ord. of 7-2-85, § 55-1101; Ord. of 5-1-90, § 1)
Sec. 14-21. - Street light tax districts created; register; responsibility for cost.
(a)
There is created hereby special tax districts which shall be known as street light tax districts which shall be identified by a number assigned by the engineering/public works department. Each such street light tax district identified by a street light tax district number shall contain and include the tax parcel number of each lot within the said street light tax district. Existing street light districts shall become street light tax districts upon the enactment of the legislation from which this section derived, and new street light tax districts shall be created upon application or proper petition and approval of the board of commissioners as provided hereinafter. Each new street light tax district so created shall be assigned a number and shall contain the tax parcel numbers of each lot contained therein.
(b)
A register of street light tax districts shall be maintained in the office of engineering/public works and the office of the Douglas County Tax Commissioner. Such registers shall be available to the public for inspection upon reasonable notice to either of these offices.
(c)
The cost of providing and maintaining street light services as provided by this article shall be borne by the owners of the property receiving that service. The charge therefore shall be such as is determined by resolution of the board of commissioners, giving consideration for the street lights, electrical service charges, and the size and number of the lots serviced by the street lights. In the event of excessive vandalism to street lights within a district which results in a county being billed for repairs, the county may pro rate these repair bills and add a pro rata share of these bills to the charge. Charges shall be assessed against all lots within the street light district whether or not the lot is located within the boundaries of a particular subdivision, so long as the lot is located within the boundaries of the street light districts.
(Ord. of 7-2-85, § 55-1102; Ord. of 5-1-90, § 2)
Sec. 14-22. - Collection and responsibility for administration.
(a)
The charges for street lighting in each street light district shall be paid as a street light district tax, and shall be collected concurrently with the ad valorem tax billed to each lot or lot resident within each street light tax district.
(b)
The administration of the services herein provided and for all billing and accounting shall be the responsibility of the board of commissioners or some department of the county government to which that responsibility shall be assigned by the board of commissioners.
(c)
Whereas the office of the tax commissioner of Douglas County shall be responsible for the timely collection of the tax assessed to each street light tax district, it shall not be responsible for accounting beyond its internal accounting procedures in order to provide an adequate record of the collection and the transmittal of the funds collected.
(Ord. of 7-2-85, § 55-1103; Ord. of 5-1-90, § 3)
Sec. 14-23. - Lien created.
In addition to any other rights of collection for late or unpaid charges, the county shall have the rights available under the laws of the state for assessment, the creation of a lien upon the property of the owner receiving the service provided, together with all rights of execution, levy, foreclosure and sale.
(Ord. of 7-2-85, § 55-1104; Ord. of 5-1-90, § 4)
Sec. 14-24. - Deposit required; forfeiture.
In addition to the other charges authorized in this article, the county shall have the right to require deposits from the lot owners receiving the streetlight service in such amount as shall be determined by the board of commissioners. This deposit shall be held by the county as security for payment for services rendered pursuant to this article, and the county shall have the authority to set off against the deposit for nonpayment for services at such times and on such occasions as shall be determined by the county. Notice of such setoff shall be given to the lot owner by mail at the address of the property serviced by the streetlights, although advance notice of such setoff shall not be required. In the event of a reduction in the deposit of a property owner because of failure to pay charges assessed pursuant to this article, the lot owner shall be required to restore the deposit to its required level upon request by the county.
(Ord. of 7-2-85, § 55-1105)
Sec. 14-25. - Streetlight construction by property developers.
(a)
All developers of residential subdivisions in the county with lots less than five (5) acres in size, and all developers of shopping centers, industrial parks and similar such developments, shall be required at their own expense to provide streetlight services in the public rights-of-way in such developments in conformity with this article.
(b)
Such developers, at the time of the submission of the preliminary plats or drawings of the development, or at the time of application for a building permit, whichever shall first occur, shall present a proposed streetlight layout which details the proposed streetlight service for the development. The proposal presented by the developer must be approved by the county engineer prior to obtaining any building permit for that development. All fixtures and standards/poles installed or to be used shall be approved not only by the county but also by the utility company which will provide electricity to the streetlights and which will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities. All such fixtures shall have appropriate arm length to place the light over the street, provided that no arm shall be less than two and one-half (2½) feet long. Should the county engineer disapprove the streetlight layout, the grounds for disapproval shall be communicated in writing to the developer. Any such disapproval by the county engineer may be appealed to the board of commissioners by filing a request for review with the county engineer within thirty (30) days from the date of the written notice of disapproval. The county engineer shall at that point transmit to the board of commissioners all papers and related documents pertaining to the action taken by the county engineer, and the board of commissioners shall review the matter at the next regularly scheduled public meeting. The board of commissioners may reverse or affirm, entirely or in part, the decision of the county engineer.
(c)
At the time of the submission of the final plat for the subdivisions, shopping centers, industrial parks, office parks or other such development on which streetlights have been constructed at the expense of the developer, the developer shall pay to county in advance a sum equal to the customary streetlight rates charged by the county for similar developments for a period of one (1) year.
(d)
The county engineer shall not receive the final plat until such time as all the provisions of this section have been satisfied, and until the developers further submit to the county engineer proof of payment for construction and installation of the streetlights in the areas sought to be dedicated, together with a copy of an executed agreement with the appropriate utility company for complete maintenance of all streetlights and related structures, wires and installations.
(e)
Upon the recommendation of the subdivision review staff the board of commissioners shall approve or deny the final plat by resolution at a regularly scheduled board of commissioners meeting not later than forty-five (45) days following the submission of the recommendation of the review staff. The streetlight district is created upon the approval of the board of commissioners of the final plat. The date of creation for the streetlight district shall be the date of approval of the final plat.
(f)
Notwithstanding all other provisions of the subdivision laws, rules and regulations of planning and zoning of Douglas County and other ordinances, any developer, contractor or other persons securing approval in accordance with section 14-25 shall post a bond equal to the installation cost and one year's electrical power for the street lighting. This bond must be given at the time of written approval of design as specified in section 14-25(b). The bond shall be payable to the chairman of the board of commissioners of Douglas County, Georgia and will provide that it shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the county manager of Douglas County or his designed representative shall have indicated that the work required for the construction and installation of street lighting in a subdivision has been satisfactorily completed.

(d)
Street. A right-of-way for vehicular traffic whether designated as street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, road, avenue, drive, expressway, boulevard, lane, place, circle, or otherwise. Street definitions herein are taken from the county Unified Development Code. Various classifications of streets and roads shall be defined as follows:
(1)
Interstate highway or expressway. A general road alignment as identified and described by the county road classification system for dedication and use as a public right-of-way to carry large volumes of through traffic at high speeds. These facilities have limited or controlled access to adjoining properties.
(2)
Major arterial road. A general road alignment as identified and described by the county road classification system for dedication and use as a public right-of-way. These are thoroughfares providing access into and through the county. Major arterials serve intrastate travel and are usually multilane roadways in urban areas. They may have a turning lane or a median. Major arterial roads may also warrant controlled access in certain areas to encourage the through movement of traffic and discourage adjacent development and turning movements which might limit the through traffic carrying capacity of the roadway. Major arterials in rural areas may be two-or four-lane roadways depending upon traffic volumes. Major arterials may provide local access to property abutting the roadway in addition to their primary function which is to move traffic.
(3)
Minor arterial road. A general road alignment as identified by the county road classification system for dedication and use as a public right-of-way. These facilities provide access into and through the county, only to a lesser extent than the major arterials. Minor arterials predominately serve intracounty traffic and may be two-or four-lane roadways. There is usually no access control on minor arterials. Minor arterials may provide local access to property abutting the roadway in addition to their primary function which is to move traffic.
(4)
Collector street. A general road alignment as identified and described by the county road classification system for dedication and use as a public right-of-way. The primary function of these facilities is to provide internal, low-volume traffic circulation and access to abutting properties.
(5)
Local street. A general road alignment as identified and described by the county road classification system for dedication and use as a public right-of-way. The primary purpose of these roadways is to provide access to abutting properties and connect those properties to the arterial and collector street system.
(6)
Cul-de-sac. A street with a single common ingress and egress and with a turnaround at the end.
(7)
Dual or boulevard. A street with opposing lanes separated by a median strip, center island, or other form of barrier, which cannot be crossed except at designated locations.
(8)
Loop. A local street that has its only ingress and egress at two (2) points on the same collector street.
