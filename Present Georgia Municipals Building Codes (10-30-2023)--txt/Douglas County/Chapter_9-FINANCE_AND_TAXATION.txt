The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program (DBE) ensures that contracts are made available to small business owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The county board of commissioners hereby adopts the regulations governing DBEs found at 49 CFR Part 26.
To qualify as a DBE in the county, a business must:
(1)
Submit a letter or other documentation from the United States Department of Transportation certifying that the business qualifies as a DBE; or
(2)
Submit a letter or other documentation from the state certifying that the business qualifies as a DBE; or
(3)
Submit a letter or other documentation from a local government entity within the state certifying that the business qualifies as a DBE; and
(4)
Execute a form prescribed by the county board of commissioners affirming under the penalty of perjury that the business qualifies as an DBE as defined by 49 CFR Part 26.

For awards valued fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), vendors are required to use "best efforts" to meet the fifteen (15) percent DBE goal. Formal tracking forms will be provided to the vendors for reporting purposes.
The county board of commissioners desires:
a.
To ensure nondiscrimination in the award and administration of purchases and contracts in the county's purchasing programs.
b.
To create an environment in which DBEs can compete fairly for purchases and contracts.
c.
To ensure that the county's DBE program is narrowly tailored in accordance with applicable law.
d.
To ensure that only firms that fully meet the eligibility standards are permitted to participate as DBEs.
e.
To help remove barriers to the participation of DBEs in purchases and contracts.
f.
To promote the use of DBEs in all types of contracts and procurement activities.
The local policy for DBEs shall not apply where restricted by federal or state law.
