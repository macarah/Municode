The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address those concerns through the adoption of the regulations in this section. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting this article are as follows:
(1)
Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(2)
Encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
(3)
Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(4)
Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful design, sitting, and vegetative screening;
(5)
Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties and personal injury from tower failure and falling ice and debris through engineering, careful siting of tower structures and other requirements;
(6)
Ensure compliance with applicable federal statues and regulations;
(7)
Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas; and
(8)
Allow new transmission towers in residential areas only if a comparable site is not available in a nonresidential area.

Sec. 56-50. - General regulations.
The following requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas governed by this article:
(1)
Application requirements. Each applicant for a telecommunications antenna or tower shall provide the planning and zoning office a survey, sealed by a surveyor registered in the state, showing the location of all lot lines, leased areas, easements, access points, structures, screening and landscaping existing on site. Each applicant shall also submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed, and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the planning and zoning office to be necessary to assess compliance with this chapter.
(2)
Siting requirements. The presence of existing uses or structures on a lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot provided said installation is otherwise in accordance with this article. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased parcel within such lot.
(3)
Inventory requirements. Each applicant for an antenna or tower shall provide to the planning and zoning officer an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. The planning and zoning officer may share such information with other applicants applying for permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the planning and zoning officer is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
(4)
Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence shall be submitted at the time of application which demonstrates that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna and may consist of any of the following:
a.
No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
b.
Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
c.
Existing towers or structure do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment;
d.
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interferences with the applicant's proposed antenna;
e.
The fees, costs, or contractual provision required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable; or
f.
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(5)
Design requirements.
a.
Telecommunications towers and antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or FCC, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. Said requirements shall not apply to an alternative tower structure.
b.
At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the maximum extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and build environment.
c.
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
d.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA, FCC or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, such lighting shall be to the minimum applicable standards so as to minimize the disturbance to the surrounding views.
e.
Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be entirely enclosed by a security fence not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device. This requirement shall not apply to alternative tower structures.
f.
Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant material that effectively reduces the visual obtrusiveness of the tower site from adjacent uses. Existing tree growth and natural land forms on site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. At a minimum a landscaped buffer strip ten feet in width shall be provided around the perimeter of the site. Said requirement shall not apply to alternative tower structures.
g.
Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be constructed to the minimum height necessary to accomplish their required telecommunications purpose.
(6)
Removal requirements. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment.
