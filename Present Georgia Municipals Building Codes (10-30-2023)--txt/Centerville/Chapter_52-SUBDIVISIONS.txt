Sec. 52-23. - Procedures for preliminary plat approval.
Prior to the cutting or grading of any street or the making of any street improvements or the installation of utilities, the subdivider shall submit to the commission a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedure:
(1)
Application. Following the preapplication review of a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning enforcement officer, at least ten days prior to the next regular meeting of the commission, a letter requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat, and four copies of the preliminary plat and other documents, as specified in section 52-24.

Permits; completion of work; inspections. Before any work is commenced or any walk built, an application for a permit for each separate job must be made to the city clerk, on blanks furnished for that purpose by the city, by the person who is to do and perform the work. Except for city construction projects, work contemplated under any permit must be completed within 60 days and the city building inspector must be notified at least 24 hours in advance of the commencement of operations. The city building inspector shall keep a file of the permits issued and shall make periodic inspections of the current sidewalk projects.
(d)
Grade. When completed, the top surface of all sidewalks shall coincide with the grade of the space between the curbline and the street line. To take care of surface drainage, a slope of one-quarter inch per foot of width of the walk shall be required so that the water will drain towards the street.
(e)
Commencement of work. All surplus earth must be removed from the job and disposed of within seven days after the sidewalk is installed.
(f)
Foundation. The contractor shall provide a template of an approved type for checking the subgrade. This template must be the full width of the sidewalk and exact depth of the concrete and must be kept on the work site at all times. No concrete shall be laid until the foundation has been checked with this template and brought to grade. Wherever a fill is required, sand, stone, gravel or cinders shall be used. This fill must be well compacted by rolling, tamping, soaking with water or other approved methods and must extend at least six inches beyond the edges of the sidewalk.
(g)
Sidewalk proper. When the grading has been completed to the satisfaction of the city, the sidewalk proper shall be laid; this shall be a layer of one course concrete, not less than four inches thick in residential districts, and not less than four inches thick in the business district. Residential driveways shall not be less than four inches thick.

Concrete. The concrete shall contain not less than 5½ bags of air entrained cement with a minimum 2,500 pounds per square inch, 28 days strength, one-inch to three-inch slump aggregate, which shall be free of all impurities and deleterious material.
(i)
Finishing. As soon as free mortar appears, a straight edge template shall be used as a strike off across the two forms to ensure a true surface. The work is then to be finished from a suitable bridge using a wooden trowel to compact the concrete where necessary and a steel trowel to put a smooth finish on the entire walk. The surface shall then be brushed lightly with an ordinary broom in order to give a slightly rough surface. The edges of the flags or squares shall be turned down with an edger having a radius not to exceed one-fourth inch.
(j)
Forms. Forms may be wood or steel and firmly set with the inside form to the grade set by the city building inspector.
(k)
Expansion joints. All concrete sidewalks shall have expansion joints at lot lines placed at right angles to the forms and extending to the bottom of the forms except where the distance between the lot lines is more than 100 feet, additional expansion joints shall be placed so that in no case the distance between expansion joints shall be more than 100 feet. All expansion joints shall be of prepared expansion paper strips not less than three-eights of an inch, nor more than one-half inch in thickness. When in place, this paper must be to the top of the finished surface of the walk. At intervals of between five feet and seven feet shall be placed steel dividers, one-fourth of an inch thick, at right angles to the forms and extending one inch into the concrete. These dividers must not be removed until the concrete is sufficiently set in order to prevent slumping. The dividers shall then be removed and a double edger used to finish the walk.
(l)
Protection of walk. All completed walks must be protected by suitable barricades of a type approved by the city building inspector. The finished walk must be protected against the elements, particularly rain, to prevent pitting. Finished work must be kept wet or covered with curing compound for at least three days to allow for proper curing. All barricades must be protected by red lights or flared during darkness, by the contractor.

City building inspector's stakes. The work to be done shall be staked out by the city building inspector where necessary, and any stakes broken or removed through carelessness will be replaced by the city building inspector at the estimated replacement cost. The contractor shall give 24 hours' notice when the services of an engineer are required. All shutoff boxes, manholes, coal holes, receiving basins, platforms, covers and any other fixtures must be set to the true surface of the walk before any concrete is placed.
(n)
Width of walks. The width of walks shall be:
(1)
In residential districts: at least four feet.
(2)
In business districts: at least four feet.
(o)
Patents. The contractor shall protect the city and the owner of the walk from all claims for patented articles, processes, materials, inventions and appliances used on the work.
