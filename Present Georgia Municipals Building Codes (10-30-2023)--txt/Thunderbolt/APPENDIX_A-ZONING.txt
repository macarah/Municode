River Drive Mixed Use District
I. Intent.
River Drive is the main point of entry into Thunderbolt and serves as the front door and "main street" of Thunderbolt through the civic presence of town hall and Waterfront Park, commercial presence of restaurants and businesses, as well as the front door to the Wilmington River/Intracoastal Waterway. As such, the development along River Drive should reflect the town's unique character, including its cultural and architectural heritage.
( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § I; Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) )
II. Guiding Principles.
The following principles shall guide development and redevelopment along River Drive:
1.
Public Waterfront—The waterfront and marshes are inherently tied to the culture, heritage, and economic prosperity of Thunderbolt. Despite previous decisions, visual connections and, where feasible, physical connections to the river and marsh are of the utmost importance.
2.
Town—Thunderbolt is a town—larger than a village, but smaller than a city. The scale and design of the buildings, the landscape, and hardscape shall reflect the intimate ambiance and character of Thunderbolt.
3.
Tree Canopy—One of the most iconic images of Thunderbolt is the "tree island" in River Drive with majestic live oaks forming a canopy over River Drive. Fortunately, many other live oaks exist along River Drive as well. Whenever possible, healthy existing live oaks should be preserved and new ones planted to sustain the canopy over time.
4.
A Place for All—As the "Main Street," River Drive should comfortably accommodate people of all ages, abilities, and mobility choices. The public realm and the adjacent development, shall provide a comfortable and inviting walking environment through appropriate design, scale, infrastructure, and landscape.
( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § II; Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) )
III. Existing uses.
At the time a new use or structure is placed on any property within the River Drive District the property owner shall bring the site and building into compliance with the standards set forth for the River Drive District. At the time a property owner plans to alter the facade of a structure (other than normal maintenance or upkeep) the property owner must comply with the building and architectural standards. It is the intent of this provision that new structures, as well as existing structures when altered in appearance or size, comply with all the standards contained herein and in particular the building and architectural standards contained herein. It is the intent of this section to require all properties and structures within the River Drive District to comply with the River Drive District standards over time so that the district will at some point have a design and appearance consistent with the intent of the general principles set forth in this ordinance.
( Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) )
IV. General Provisions.
1.
Pedestrian comfort shall be a primary consideration along River Drive. Design conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian movement generally shall be decided in favor of the pedestrian.
2.
Each lot with frontage along River Drive shall front River Drive. Façades shall be built parallel to the principal frontage, with the primary building entrance facing River Drive.
3.
Dumpsters, outside storage, mechanical equipment, etc. shall not be visible from the public right-of-way and shall be screened by a landscape wall high enough to visually conceal equipment, storage, and/or service areas located behind. The minimum height of the wall shall be the actual height required to screen the object from view.
4.
Drive-throughs are prohibited.
5.
In the case of a conflict with other provisions of the code, the River Drive District shall apply.
6.
Special exceptions of design standards may be granted by the planning and zoning commission based on exceptional merit of the project to exceed the provisions of the intent of this district and application of the guiding principles.

( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § VIII; Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) )
X. Landscape and streetscape.
1.
In general. The landscape, the site's existing and new vegetation, plays an essential role in creating the town's character. Its design and maintenance must therefore be given prominent attention starting at the conceptual phase of a project. Historically, live oaks, palms, and azaleas have been predominate in the existing town landscape. Great care should be taken to incorporate this aesthetic into the design, preserve a variety of existing native trees and shrubs, and minimize environmental impacts from development.
i.
Two of the most important site features that need to be identified are existing vegetation including understory and significant trees. These are extremely important elements to be addressed in the placement of structures and other site features as trees contribute to the overall quality of life and identity of Thunderbolt. In some cases, the location of the tree canopy or a specimen tree will be the dominant determining factor in the site design as well as the architectural design of the structures. Existing vegetation that can be preserved, especially in buffers, adds significantly to the project's town character.
ii.
Shrubs must be selected to complement the natural setting, provide visual interest, and screen less desirable elements of the project. The species used must take into consideration the site's growing conditions and existing vegetation types. While a variety of species is desirable for texture and color, emphasis must be given to overall order and continuity of the landscape plan. Seasonal availability and planting time also need to be considered.
iii.
Groundcover plants should generally be a limited part of the landscape plan. When used, evergreen species with low maintenance needs are to be selected. Large grassed lawn areas encompassing a major portion of the site are to be avoided. Grass is appropriate as borders or around entrances and other focal points; grass shall not be allowed to be planted within a mower's width away from the base of existing trees. Pine straw or other mulch indigenous to the area should be used to stabilize areas and control weed growth.
iv.
Native plants encouraged. The use of native plants is highly encouraged, as these plants typically require less water, fertilizer, and maintenance and reinforce the coastal ecosystem of the Wilmington River and associated low country.
1.
Trees.
General principles: Tree removal and replacement requirements are established by the town's tree ordinance. While these minimum requirements must be adhered to, there are additional aesthetic considerations that must also be implemented when a tree removal or landscape plan is submitted. These include:
•
Preserving the tree canopy;
•
Protecting significant or specimen trees and clusters of trees;
•
Preserving smaller understory trees and shrubs:
•
Requiring larger size replacement trees or additional trees depending on the size or number of existing trees removed or relationship to building mass and height; and
•
Selection of particular species of replacement trees within a required category for screening or visual effect.
The top priority for the location of existing trees and new trees are street trees, parking lots, and the area between parking lots and structures. This is a major component of town character.
i.
Within the River Drive District, the definition of a specimen tree as defined in section 5-329.D shall be modified to include large hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweet gums, etc. in fair or better condition, which equals or exceeds 24" dbh (two feet diameter breast height).
ii.
Tree preservation. Preservation of healthy canopy trees shall serve as sufficient grounds to vary from the development standards of this district upon approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
iii.
Canopy Trees.
1.
Lots shall provide at least one canopy tree for every 50 feet of frontage, with the lot width at the frontage rounded to the nearest 50 feet; i.e., lots with a width less than 75 feet shall provide at least one canopy tree, lots with a width of 75 to 124 feet shall provide at least two canopy trees, and so on. Relief can be granted by staff for driveways, utilities and other unmovable obstructions. Canopy trees may be located in a tree yard or in the front setback parallel to the local access street. Lots with less than 50 feet of frontage may be exempted from this requirement upon approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
2.
Canopy tree requirements Canopy trees shall be a minimum of ten feet in height, with a four- to five-foot spread, and a two-inch caliper trunk at time of planting. Recommended Canopy Trees: Quercus Phellus (Willow Oak), Celtis Laevigatta (Hackberry), Quercus virginiana (Live Oak).
iv.
Parking Lots.
1.
Canopy trees shall be planted in parking islands which shall have 400 square feet of unpaved soil for root development. The standard tree island shall be 20 feet by 20 feet; provided, however, that where the islands are an extension of a ten-foot-wide landscape area, the islands may be reduced in width to 16 feet.
2.
Islands shall not be separated by more than 12 parking spaces, including the landscaped ends of drive aisles, and shall be designed so as to minimize foot traffic across them.
3.
The use of porous paving within parking lots to provide root space for planted and preserved trees to meet the necessary rooting space requirement may be required at the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
v.
Tree planting standards.
1.
Newly planted trees shall meet the following requirements:
a.
All large hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, etc. must be of at least two-and-one-half-inch caliper.
b.
All medium trees, such as maple, river birch, ash, etc., must be a minimum of two-inch caliper.
c.
All small trees, such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc., must be a minimum of one-inch caliper.
2.
All planting of new trees shall be done in accordance with ANSI A-300-1995 or most recent edition.
3.
All trees and plant materials shall conform to the most recent edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock by the American Association Nurserymen.
4.
All trees shall be provided with a means for delivery of water in a quantity that is sufficient to establish and maintain the viability of the plants. Watering bags may be used.
3.
Sidewalk required. A publicly-accessible continuous sidewalk shall be provided along River Drive. Such sidewalk shall be ADA compliant and shall generally be eight feet in width. In no case shall such sidewalk be less than six feet in width.
( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § IX; Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) )
XI. Topography
While the town generally has little variation in topography it is important to identify the existing conditions in terms of drainage and flood elevation requirements. In consideration of the latter, alternative methods such as dry flood proofing and terracing should be utilized in lieu of fill to reduce the impact of elevation changes. No fill is allowed in any flood zone unless it is in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and the town's ordinances.
( Ord. of 11-14-2018(2)
X. Building and Architectural Standards.
These building guidelines are intended to encourage quality, attention to detail, and an appreciation of the coastal vernacular appropriate for River Drive. Buildings within the River Drive District should be timeless and reflective of coastal architectural styles appropriate for the area.
1.
Materials. Materials establish architectural character and can lend variety to the appearance of a district. Material should be based on those that have historically appeared in construction in the coastal region. Vinyl siding is prohibited. Corrugated metal may be used and visible on the exterior of the building in limited ways as approved by the town if its use is consistent with coastal architecture for the low country and a fishing village style. Metal buildings are only allowed if the outside portions of the building are covered by some other acceptable finish that is consistent with coastal and low country architecture and a fishing village style.
The overall exterior color scheme must be selected to be harmonious and blend with the natural surroundings of the site. Earth tones must be chosen as the predominant colors. Colors shall not be used to cause the structure to stand out. Consideration must be given to the compatibility of colors with those existing in the vicinity. The size of the structure and the amount of shading it will receive are also factors in the selection of colors.
Any accent colors shall be of analogous tints, shades or tones that are low in intensity or brightness. Primary, secondary and highly saturated, bright colors should be avoided. Accent colors may only be approved for very limited use where appropriate to highlight a feature of the design. A small area of brighter color may be appropriate to emphasize an architectural detail but will not be approved for a larger area. The number of such colors shall be limited and must be compatible within the overall color scheme.
Exterior color schemes must avoid placing together colors with values that are highly contrasting. Subtle levels of contrast are desirable to emphasize architectural elements. A slightly darker wall color on the bottom story of a two-story structure may help reduce the visual height of the building. As an example the use of black and white or off-white together is typically avoided and may be approved only for very limited use where a high level of contrast is warranted.
2.
Style. Architectural style should be consistent with the coastal vernacular of Thunderbolt and coastal Georgia. The consistency of a single style used on a building is essential.
i.
Architectural stylistic integrity is encouraged.
ii.
All elements of design, shape, and form should be consistent with the selected architectural style.
iii.
Ornamentation should be restrained, simplistic in style, and appropriate to the style of the building.
iv.
Buildings with frontage along Bannon Drive shall be residential in character in order to be compatible with the adjacent residential dwellings along Bannon Drive.
3.
Roof.
i.
Roof material shall be galvanized roofing (standing seam or v-crimp), wood, composite/manufactured shake, architectural shingles.
ii.
Principal roof(s) shall be a symmetrical with a slope of 4:12 to 12:12. Flat roofs may be permitted on River Drive lots based on architectural merit of the building upon approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
iii.
Dormers may be permitted based on architectural merit of the building upon approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Dormer windows shall include divided lite panes.
iv.
Eave Treatments:
1.
Prefer open rafters without full fascia and no horizontal soffits.
2.
Where provided, wood and fiber composite fascia and soffits are encouraged—vinyl is prohibited.
4.
Entryways. Entryways comprise doorways, porches and other elements that contribute to the sense of arrival into the building. Entryways should be a prominent feature of the façade.
5.
Windows & Doors.
i.
Windows and doors shall generally be complimentary to the architectural style of the building.
ii.
Window openings shall have vertical proportions, or may be square.
iii.
Consider using muntins in windows to create divided lites.
iv.
Wood and composite doors solid cores are encouraged—Steel is discouraged.
6.
Shutters. Window shutters are part of the coastal vernacular and were functional for providing interior shading in the summer and to protect windows during storms. With the advent of air conditioning, window shutters became less functional and practical, serving instead as an ornamental design element. The following should be addressed when designing shutters for a building:
i.
Shutters shall be of louvered or paneled wood construction.
ii.
Shutters shall be one-half the width of the sash they are covering. All shutters are encouraged to be installed to be operable, with hinges and dogs (a device mounted to the wall that may be pivoted to prevent the shutter from moving when in the open position).
7.
Porches.
i.
The use of porches is highly encouraged.
ii.
Front porches should be designed to have a depth that is great enough to make them functional spaces. Generally, front porches should be a minimum of 25% of the total façade in width and at least ten (10) feet in depth to allow adequate room for furnishings and circulation.
iii.
Front porches shall not be enclosed with wood, glass, screens, or other materials.
iv.
Side porches may be screened if the structural framework for the screen panels is minimal and the open appearance of the porch is maintained. Screen panels should be placed behind the original features such as columns or railings.
8.
Fences. Fences are often character defining features and should be treated sensitively. It is important that the fence design harmonize with the character of the structure.
i.
Fences, garden walls, and gates should be appropriate in materials, design, and scale to the character of the structure they surround.
ii.
Woven wire (chain link), stockade fences (with jagged tops), and vinyl fences are prohibited.
iii.
Gates should be compatible with any existing fencing, walls or landscaping, and should be designed to swing onto the private walkway, not onto the public sidewalk or right-of-way.
iv.
Front yard fences shall be no more than 48" in height.
9.
Garages and Garage Doors.
i.
For residential structures, the garage should serve as a secondary use and be subservient in scale and mass to the house.
ii.
Garages are encouraged to be detached and located at the rear of the property.
iii.
Attached garages shall be side loading to avoid facing the street.
iv.
Garage bays should be individual bays with doors no wider than ten (10) feet. Double wide doors are not allowed.
( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § X; Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) ; Ord. of 5-8-2019 )
XIII. Signs.
Materials, colors, size, and shapes of proposed signs shall be compatible with the related buildings. Size and proportion of the sign shall not be a dominant feature of the site and shall be judged by sizes and proportions of signs on adjacent and nearby properties which are compatible with the character of River Drive. In addition to the standards of article XIII of the zoning ordinance, the following shall apply:
1.
Free-standing signs shall be no more than 8' in height and 6' in width. The sign area shall be no more than 25 square feet for a single tenant and 30 feet for multiple tenants. Pylon signs are not allowed.
2.
Projecting signs are allowed and shall be no more than six (6) square feet in area and shall be installed with a minimum clear height of 8' below the sign.
In addition, the guidelines herein below shall be considered and adhered to regarding, the use of signs:
i.
Signs are an important element to most buildings and developments. Too often no allowance is made in the design of projects for the placement of signs. Many of the principles for good design of structures also apply to the design of signs. Sign design does not begin with a blank sheet of paper. The materials, details, and colors of the building are all starting points for good sign design. In other words, signs should reflect the design of the project they are intended to identify.
ii.
The size and number of signs will be determined by the town's sign ordinance. Signs should serve to identify the business or development. The amount of information on signs shall be no more than is necessary to provide reasonable identification of the business.
iii.
Signs should provide strong visual interest and include three-dimensional design. Only high quality, durable materials such as wood, sign foam, and masonry shall be used. Bright colors and reflective surfaces shall be avoided or very limited in size and used as accents rather than predominant design elements.
iv.
For façade signs adequate wall space must be provided in a location that will allow the sign to function properly while also appear as if it "belongs" with the building. The sign should be placed within a single architectural element and the colors, materials, and details should complement the structure's design. In good sign design the façade signs appear as an integral component of the building design rather than as an afterthought. Tenant signs at shopping centers and office complexes should be uniform in design and placed on the façade of the tenant space.
v.
Freestanding or monument signs should be placed in logical locations near the project's entrance and their design must complement the architectural design of the building(s) and other elements of development on the site. Monument signs with one sign face shall be finished on the "back" side.
Good sign design should apply to all signs on a site including monument signs, directional signs, and façade signs. A successful sign system will integrate all sign types on site in a unified system of materials colors shapes, and sizes that are compatible with the architecture and other site elements. Tenants may be required to select colors and fonts for their signs that are different than their typical logo colors and fonts in order to comply with the approved sign system.
( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § XI; Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) ; Ord. of 5-8-2019 )
XIV. Lighting.
1.
All lighting shall have no light emitted above 90 degrees. Exceptions may be made by the Planning and Zoning Commission for construction lighting, parks, and ornamental and/or architectural lighting.
2.
Decorative type lighting is allowed if limited in scone and properly designed. The goal is to add to the visual quality of the development without detracting from the beauty of the night sky. Such lighting may include concealed low wattage landscape up lights for significant trees or shrubbery at an entryway. Low bollard type lighting can be used to illuminate walkways and drive aisles. Important architectural elements can be softly illuminated to add emphasis at night. Any light fixtures mounted in a tree must follow best management practices to avoid damage to the tree.
3.
LED lights are preferred over incandescent lamps, metal halide. halogen or any other high wattage tvpe lights. The same type of light source must be used for the same or similar types of lighting on site. The style and finish of exterior lighting, including fixtures and poles, should be selected to complement the details and materials of the structure and other site elements. A consistent finish should be selected for fixtures of similar types throughout the site.
( Ord. of 11-14-2018(2) ; Ord. of 5-8-2019 )
XV. Procedures/design review/submittal requirements.
See Art. XV(Q) for procedures/design review/ submittal requirements for the River Drive and Victory Drive Districts.
( Ord. of 11-14-2018 )
Victory Drive Mixed Use District
I. Intent.
The Mayor and Council of the Town of Thunderbolt hereby establish an overlay district on Victory Drive called the Victory Drive District to recognize the "Main Street" prominence of Victory Drive and manage and encourage specific types of development. The overlay district will be administered as a part of the existing development review process and will encourage small scale, mixed-use residential and commercial businesses.
( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § I (Exh. A) )
II. Guiding Principles.
The following principles shall guide development and redevelopment along the Victory Drive District:
• Overlay District—At the time a new use or structure is placed on any property within the Victory Drive District, the property owner shall bring the site and building into compliance with the standards set forth for the Victory Drive District. At the time a property owner plans to alter the exterior of a structure the property owner must comply with the Building and Architectural standards. All work must be approved by the Town's Planning and Zoning Commission. It is the intent of this provision that new structures, as well as existing structures when altered in appearance or size, comply with all the standards contained herein and in particular the building and architectural standards contained herein. It is the intent of this section to require all properties and structures within the Victory Drive District to comply with the Victory Drive District standards over time so that the district will at some point have a design and appearance consistent with the intent of the general principles set forth in this ordinance.
• The Town of Thunderbolt is a town—larger than a village, but smaller than a city. The scale and design of the buildings, the landscape, and hardscape shall reflect the intimate ambiance and character of Thunderbolt.
• Tree Canopy—One of the most iconic images of Victory Drive is the historic palm median and majestic live oaks. It is the intention of this ordinance that new development or changes in use explore the potential to return the live oak framework to the commercialized district streetscape. Healthy existing live oaks shall be preserved and new ones planted to sustain the canopy. Refer to Town of Thunderbolt's tree ordinance.
• One goal of this ordinance is to provide sidewalks on the south side of Victory Drive between the commercial district and the Wilmington River Bridge. Sidewalks on the north side of Victory Drive are also encouraged.
• A Place for All—Victory Drive should comfortably accommodate people of all ages, abilities, and mobility choices. The public realm and the adjacent development shall provide a comfortable and inviting environment through appropriate design, scale, infrastructure, and landscape.
( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § II (Exh. A) )
III. General Provisions.
1.
Each lot with frontage along Victory Drive shall front Victory Drive. Facades shall be built parallel to the principal frontage, with the primary building entrance facing Victory Drive. On a corner lot, the developer or owner is encouraged to place the primary entrance to be on a secondary road.
2.
Dumpsters, outside storage, mechanical equipment, etc., shall not be visible from the public right-of-way and shall be screened by landscaping or a wall high enough to visually conceal equipment, storage, and/or service areas located behind. The minimum height of the landscaping or wall shall be the actual height required to screen the object from view.
3.
Drive-throughs will only be allowed after it is shown that the use of a drive through will not interfere with traffic on the public street.
4.
It is the intent of this ordinance to maintain and/or reestablish local street networks and provide for local road networks adjacent to Victory Drive that accommodate cars, pedestrians and bicycles and then connect to an existing street network so that there are future connections to adjacent parcels. One goal is to create Interparcel connections and shared access in order to improve safety and minimize both impacts on historic landscape and the need for turn lanes on Victory Drive.

( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § VII (Exh. A) )
VIII. Landscape and Streetscape.
The Landscape
The landscape, the site's existing and new vegetation, plays an essential role in creating the Town's Character. Its design and maintenance must therefore be given prominent attention starting at the conceptual phase of a project. Historically, Live Oaks, palms, and azaleas have been predominate in the existing Town landscape. Great care should be taken to incorporate this aesthetic into the design, preserve a variety of existing native trees and shrubs, and minimize environmental impacts from development.
Topography
While the Town generally has little variation in topography it is important to identify the existing conditions in terms of drainage and flood elevation requirements. In consideration of the latter, alternative methods such as dry flood proofing and terracing should be utilized in lieu of fill to reduce the impact of elevation changes. No fill is allowed in any flood zone unless it is in accordance with Federal, State and the Town's ordinances.
Existing Vegetation and Significant Trees
Two of the most important site features that need to be identified are existing vegetation including understory and significant trees. These are extremely important elements to be addressed in the placement of structures and other site features as trees contribute to the overall quality of life and identity of Thunderbolt. In some cases, the location of the tree canopy or a specimen tree will be the dominant determining factor in the site design as well as the architectural design of the structures. Existing vegetation that can be preserved, especially in buffers, adds significantly to the project's Town Character.
Setbacks and Buffers
Adjacent use and street setback lines and buffers must be identified in order to establish the extent of site features such as parking spaces and stormwater retention areas. These are not "build to" lines but simply define the area in which structures and other development are allowed and separate development from adjacent streets and adjacent development. Separation serves to ensure protection from street traffic as well as provide adequate air circulation and light between structures. Projects that fill the buildable area with structures and paving will have a difficult time achieving Town Character and ultimate approval.
Buffers
The most important component of buffers is the vegetation they contain. Buffers can be classified into three basic categories:
UNDISTURBED BUFFERS: A buffer where all of the existing vegetation is neither removed nor pruned.
NATURAL BUFFERS: A buffer where some existing vegetation is removed or pruned. Some additional plant materials may be added to natural buffers to enhance their appearance. Any additional plantings should be native species complimentary to the existing vegetation. Their placement should be designed so that they appear as if they were a part of the existing vegetation.
LANDSCAPED BUFFERS: A buffer where most of the vegetation has been planted. Planting may be more formal and may be shaped by more extensive pruning.
Shrubs
Shrubs must be selected to complement the natural setting, provide visual interest, and screen less desirable elements of the project. The species used must take into consideration the site's growing conditions and existing vegetation types. While a variety of species is desirable for texture and color, emphasis must be given to overall order and continuity of the landscape plan. Seasonal availability and planting time also need to be considered.
Groundcovers
Groundcover plants should generally be a limited part of the landscape plan. When used, evergreen species with low maintenance needs are to be selected. Large grassed lawn areas encompassing a major portion of the site are to be avoided. Grass is appropriate as borders or around entrances and other focal points; grass shall not be allowed to be planted within a mower's width away from the base of existing trees. Pine straw or other mulch indigenous to the area should be used to stabilize areas and control weed growth.
Trees
Tree removal and replacement requirements are established by the Town's Tree Ordinance. While these minimum requirements must be adhered to, there are additional aesthetic considerations that must also be implemented when a tree removal or landscape plan is submitted. These include:
• Preserving the tree canopy;
• Protecting significant or specimen trees and clusters of trees;
• Preserving smaller understory trees and shrubs;
• Requiring larger size replacement trees or additional trees depending on the size or number of existing trees removed or relationship to building mass and height; and
• Selection of particular species of replacement trees within a required category for screening or visual effect.
The top priority for the location of existing trees and new trees are street buffers, parking lots, and the area between parking lots and structures. This is a major component of Town Character.
( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § VIII (Exh. A) )
IX. Building and Architectural Standards.
These building guidelines are intended to encourage quality, attention to detail, and an appreciation of the coastal vernacular appropriate in the Victory Drive District. Buildings in the Victory Drive District should be timeless and reflective of coastal architectural styles appropriate for the area.
a.
Materials
Materials establish architectural character and can lend variety to the appearance of a district. Material should be based on those that have historically appeared in construction in the coastal region. Vinyl siding is prohibited. Corrugated metal may be used and visible on the exterior of the building in limited ways as approved by the Town if its use is consistent with coastal architecture for the low country and a fishing village style. Metal buildings are only allowed if the outside portions of the building are covered by some other acceptable finish that is consistent with coastal and low country architecture and a fishing village style.
The overall exterior color scheme must be selected to be harmonious and blend with the natural surroundings of the site. Earth tones must be chosen as the predominant colors. Colors shall not be used to cause the structure to stand out. Consideration must be given to the compatibility of colors with those existing in the vicinity. The size of the structure and the amount of shading it will receive are also factors in the selection of colors.
Any accent colors shall be of analogous tints, shades or tones that are low in intensity or brightness. Primary, secondary and highly saturated, bright colors should be avoided. Accent colors may only be approved for very limited use where appropriate to highlight a feature of the design. A small area of brighter color may be appropriate to emphasize an architectural detail but will not be approved for a larger area. The number of such colors shall be limited and must be compatible within the overall color scheme.
Exterior color schemes must avoid placing together colors with values that are highly contrasting. Subtle levels of contrast are desirable to emphasize architectural elements. A slightly darker wall color on the bottom story of a two-story structure may help reduce the visual height of the building. As an example, the use of black and white or off-white together is typically avoided and may be approved only for very limited use where a high level of contrast is warranted.
The clerk of the planning and zoning commission will provide petitioners with examples of colors that are acceptable but all colors and color schemes for exterior of buildings and structures must have final approval by the planning and zoning commission and the mayor and council. Permission to repaint a building or structure the same color is not required.
b.
Style
Architectural style should be consistent with the coastal vernacular of Thunderbolt and coastal Georgia. The consistency of a single style used on a building is essential.
i.
Architectural stylistic integrity is required.
ii.
All elements of design, shape, and form shall be consistent with the selected architectural style.
iii.
Ornamentation shall be restrained, simplistic in style, and appropriate to the style of the building.
The clerk of the planning and zoning commission will provide to petitioners with examples for architectural style that are acceptable but all new uses and renovated old uses of buildings and structures must have final approval by the planning and zoning commission and the mayor and council.
c.
Roof
i.
Roof material shall be galvanized roofing (standing seam or v-crimp), wood, composite/manufactured shake and/or architectural shingles. Principal roof(s) shall be a symmetrical with a slope of 4:12 to 12:12. Flat roofs will only be permitted based on architectural merit of the building.
ii.
Eave Treatments:
1.
Open rafters without full fascia and without horizontal soffits are preferred.
2.
Where provided, wood and fiber composite fascia and soffits are encouraged—vinyl and aluminum are prohibited.
d.
Entryways
Entryways comprise doorways, porches and other elements that contribute to the sense of arrival into the building. Entryways shall be a prominent feature of the facade.
e.
Windows and Doors
i.
Windows and doors shall generally be complimentary to the architectural style of the building.
ii.
Window openings shall have vertical proportions, or may be square.
iii.
Muntins in windows to create divided lites are encouraged.
iv.
Wood and composite solid cores doors are encouraged—Steel is discouraged.
f.
Shutters
Window shutters are part of the coastal vernacular and were functional for providing interior shading in the summer and to protect windows during storms. With the advent of air conditioning, window shutters became less functional and practical, serving instead as an ornamental design element. The following shall be addressed when designing shutters for a building:
i.
Shutters shall be of louvered or paneled wood construction.
ii.
Shutters shall be one-half the width of the sash they are covering. All shutters are encouraged to be installed to be operable, with hinges and dogs provided.
g.
Porches
i.
The use of porches is highly encouraged.
ii.
Front porches should be designed to have a depth that is great enough to make them functional spaces. Generally, front porches should be a minimum of 25% of the total facade in width and at least ten (10) feet in depth to allow adequate room for furnishings and circulation.
iii.
Front porches shall not be enclosed with wood, glass, screens, or other materials.
iv.
Side porches may be screened if the structural framework for the screen panels is minimal and the open appearance of the porch is maintained. Screen panels should be placed behind the original features such as columns or railings.
h.
Fences
Fences are often character-defining features and should be treated sensitively. It is important that the fence design harmonize with the character of the structure.
i.
Fences, garden walls, and gates should be appropriate in materials, design, and scale to the character of the structure they surround.
ii.
Woven wire (chain link), stockade fences (with jagged tops), dog ear and vinyl fences are prohibited.
iii.
Gates shall be compatible with any fencing, walls or landscaping, and should be designed to swing onto the private walkway, not onto the public sidewalk or right-of-way. Life-safety and egress shall be considered when locating all gates and gate swings.
iv.
Front yard fences shall be no more than 48" in height.
i.
Garages and Garage Doors
i.
For residential structures, the garage should serve as a secondary use and be subservient in scale and mass to the house.
ii.
Garages are encouraged to be detached and located at the rear of the property.
iii.
Attached garages shall be side-loading to avoid facing the street.
iv.
Garage bays should be individual bays with doors no wider than ten (10) feet. Double wide doors are not allowed.
( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § IX (Exh. A) )
X. Signs.
Materials, colors, size, and shapes of proposed signs shall be compatible with the related buildings. Size and proportion of the sign shall not be a dominant feature of the site and shall be proportion and compatible with the character of the Victory Drive Standards. In addition to the standards of Article XIII of the zoning ordinance, the following shall apply:
a.
Free-standing signs shall be no more than 8' in height and 6' in width. The sign area shall be no more than 25 square feet for a single tenant and 30 square feet for multiple tenants. Pylon signs are not allowed.
b.
Projecting signs are allowed and shall be no more than six (6) square feet in area and shall be installed with a minimum clear height of 8' below the lowest portion of the sign.
In addition the guidelines herein below shall be considered and adhered to regarding the use of signs:
i.
Signs are an important element to most buildings and developments. Too often no allowance is made in the design of projects for the placement of signs. Many of the principles for good design of structures also apply to the design of signs. Sign design does not begin with a blank sheet of paper. The materials, details, and colors of the building are all starting points for good sign design. In other words, signs should reflect the design of the project they are intended to identify.
ii.
The size and number of signs will be determined by the Town's Sign Ordinance. Signs should serve to identify the business or development and not act as advertisements. The amount of information on signs shall be no more than is necessary to provide reasonable identification of the business.
iii.
Signs should provide strong visual interest and include three-dimensional design. Only high quality, durable materials such as wood, sign foam, and masonry shall be used. Bright colors and reflective surfaces shall be avoided or very limited in size and used as accents rather than predominant design elements.
iv.
For facade signs, adequate wall space must be provided in a location that will allow the sign to function properly while also appear as if it "belongs" with the building. The sign should be placed within a single architectural element and the colors, materials, and details should compliment the structure's design. In good sign design the facade signs appear as an integral component of the building design rather than as an afterthought. Tenant signs at shopping centers and office complexes should be uniform in design and placed on the facade of the tenant space.
v.
Freestanding or monument signs should be placed in logical locations near the project's entrance and their design must complement the architectural design of the building(s) and other elements of development on the site. Monument signs with one sign face shall be finished on the "back" side.
vi.
Good sign design should apply to all signs on a site including monument signs, directional signs, and facade signs. A successful sign system will integrate all sign types on site in a unified system of materials, colors, shapes, and sizes that are compatible with the architecture and other site elements. Tenants may be required to select colors and fonts for their signs that are different than their typical logo colors and fonts in order to comply with the approved sign system.
The provisions concerning signs applicable to this district are in addition to the provisions regarding signs in Article XIII of the Zoning Ordinance. Any conflict between the sign provisions in this district and Article XIII shall be resolved by giving greater weight to the language in this section.
( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § X (Exh. A) ; Ord. of 5-8-2019 )
XI. Lighting.
Decorative type lighting is allowed if limited in scope and properly designed. The goal is to add to the visual quality of the development without detracting from the beauty of the night sky. Such lighting may include concealed low wattage landscape up lights for significant trees or shrubbery at an entryway. Low bollard type lighting can be used to illuminate walkways and drive aisles. Important architectural elements can be softly illuminated to add emphasis at night. When lighting trees up lighting is preferred. Any light fixtures mounted in a tree must follow best management practices to avoid damage to the tree.
LED lights are preferred over Incandescent lamps, metal halide, halogen or any other high wattage type lights. The same type of light source must be used for the same or similar types of lighting on site. The style and finish of exterior lighting, including fixtures and poles, should be selected to complement the details and materials of the structure and other site elements. A consistent finish should be selected for fixtures of similar types throughout the site.

ARTICLE VI. - DISTRICTS SHOWN ON MAPS
The boundaries of the various districts are shown on a zoning map of Thunderbolt, Georgia, which is located in the office of the town hall. The zoning map of the incorporated area is hereby made a part of this ordinance; and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this ordinance as if all the matter and information set forth by said maps were fully described herein.
ARTICLE VII. - INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of boundaries of any zoning district as shown on the zoning map of the Town of Thunderbolt the following rules shall apply:
1.
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the centerline of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way, stream bed or river bed or such centerlines extended, then such centerlines shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
2.
Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the corporate limits line of the town, then such corporate limits line shall be construed to be such district boundaries.
3.
Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as being set back from a street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and parallel thereto, then such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of such street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river as being parallel thereto.
4.
Where a district boundary divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of the lot; provided, however, that such extension shall not include any part of such lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary; and provided further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restrictions of the district applying to adjoining lots which front on the same street as the lot frontage in question shall apply.
5.
The board of zoning appeals shall determine questions regarding the exact location of district boundary lines.
ARTICLE VIII. - PROVISIONS REGARDING USES
Permitted uses in the various zoning districts are identified in this ordinance. Uses permitted upon review require site plan approval by the board of zoning appeals. Such designation requires a finding by the board of zoning appeals of the following conditions of fact prior to issuing a conditional approval:
1.
The development of such use at the location proposed, and in the manner proposed, will not adversely affect abutting residential property.
2.
The site development plan of such use provides for adequate vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation, and that the resulting concentration of vehicular traffic will not present traffic problems or impede normal movement on adjacent streets.
3.
The need for such a use is justified on the basis of facts presented by the applicant which clearly indicates that such use would be appropriate, add to the orderly development of the community, and would further the purpose and intent of this ordinance.
ARTICLE IX. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
Planned Requirement
1.
Purpose. Planned development districts may be required by the mayor and alderman for properties which, in their judgment, deserve or require special considerations for site plan development due to proximity of residential uses, the intensity of proposed development, or the presence of actual or potential traffic problems, including access and egress. The prefix "P" may be applied to any zoning district classification for any property that meets the aforementioned criteria.
2.
Planned requirement. A "P" district classification may be initiated by a petitioner or by the mayor and aldermen. Prior to adoption of a plan development classification for a property a sight development plan shall be presented to the planning and zoning commission for approval. As a part of its consideration of a sight plan in a plan district the planning and zoning commissioner shall recommend a maximum density for residential uses within the proposed "P" district. Such recommendation shall be considered by the mayor and aldermen at the time of the public hearing on any re-zoning proposed. The mayor and aldermen may elect to approve the recommended density requirement, modify it or reject it. If the maximum density standard is approved, it shall become a part of the zoning classification of the property and be so stated on the official zoning map. (For example an R-3 may become a P-R-3-15 meaning a maximum of 15 units per net acre).
3.
Land development standards. The planning and zoning commission may require developers or contractors to provide a general development plan for consideration at the time of application for rezoning.
4.
General plan. The general plan for a proposed P-district shall include proposed uses and overall development standards and shall indicate the proposed use or reuse of all land, open spaces, location of major streets, recreation areas, school sites, religious centers, and such other plan elements and reasonable design criteria as may be deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission in a pre-application conference to accomplish the purposes of the zoning ordinance.
5.
Intent. Such plan shall promote a stable environment, and desirable character in harmony with the established or proposed land use pattern in surrounding areas.
6.
Specific plan. Following approval of the generalized development plan by the planning and zoning commission, no development shall take place until detailed development plans or subdivision plats, where required, be submitted for review and are approved. Specific site plans shall be considered after approval of a general development plan by the planning and zoning commission and the mayor and aldermen of the Town of Thunderbolt. In smaller projects, a general development plan may be required, but the planning and zoning commission should be consulted as to the requirement for a general development plan.
If property within a P- (Planned) zone is to be developed in phases, such detailed development plans may be submitted in phases.
Specific development plans shall indicate in detail the layout of proposed streets and curb cuts; parking areas; amenities such as open spaces, landscapes, pedestrian and bicycle trails; major drainage ways; school locations; church locations; locations of public facilities; building arrangements; commercial areas; lot arrangements and other significant details as may be reasonably required.
Specific development plans approved by the zoning commission shall be certified to the zoning administrator for the issuance of applicable permits. Development requiring subdivision actions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Thunderbolt Subdivision Regulations. No development shall take place within a P-District that is not shown on a specific development plan as certified by the planning and zoning commission.
7.
Standards. Development standards shall be applied as provided elsewhere in this chapter for the particular district. Provided that the board of zoning appeals may approve variances from these requirements at the request of the developer on a finding that such variances would:
1.
Be in keeping with the overall character of the area.
2.
Would not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this ordinance.
3.
Would not be detrimental to existing or proposed surrounding uses.
4.
Would serve public purposes to a degree equal to or greater than the standards replaced.
8.
Overlay district. When an area is rezoned to a planned district classification, the letter "P" shall be placed in front of the standard zoning classification identification for the area in question, e.g., an area zoned R-3, which is rezoned to a planned district classification, shall be indicated as a P-R-3.

Duty to provide off-street parking and loading. Except as hereinafter provided, no land shall be used or occupied, and no use shall be designed, created, altered, used or occupied, and no use shall be operated unless off-street parking and loading facilities are provided in at least the amount required by this article; provided, however, that any use in operation on the effective date of this ordinance that does not have the required off-street parking and loading spaces shall not be required to provide off-street parking and loading spaces until such time as the existing gross floor area is increased by 40 percent or more.
(b)
Off-street loading and parking to meet design standards. Whenever off-street parking and/or loading facilities are established within any zoning district either as a principal use or an accessory use, and whether or not required by this ordinance, such off-street parking and loading facilities shall comply with design requirements for off-street parking facilities set forth in this article.
Required minimum off street loading space shall be provided. There shall be sufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of trucks that will be loading, unloading or stored at any one time; provided, however that there shall be a minimum of one off street loading space for each 10,000 square feet of total floor area or fraction thereof. Each loading space shall be not less than ten feet wide and shall be of such length as is necessary to accommodate the type of cab or truck or bus that will be loading, unloading or parking; provided, however, that such length shall be not less than 30 feet. Such spaces, including maneuvering space shall be located entirely off the street. All required off street loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building or use, which they are intended to serve.

(a)
Parking and loading areas—Surface materials. Off-street parking and loading areas containing more than 1,000 square feet of parking and driveway space shall be paved with concrete or asphalt pavement and subject to green space provisions.
(b)
Separation from walkways and streets. All off-street parking, off-street loading, and service areas shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks, streets, and lanes by curbing or other protective devices.
(c)
Buffer required when adjoining property is residential. Where off-street parking, loading or service areas are proposed to be located closer than 50 feet to a lot in any R zoning district or to any lot upon which there exists a dwelling as a permitted use, and where such parking, loading or service areas are not entirely screened visually from such lot by an intervening building or structure, there shall be provided along the lot line a continuous visual buffer with a minimum height of six feet. No such buffer shall extend nearer to a street right-of-way line than the established building line of the adjoining residential lot, and no buffer shall be required along a property line immediately adjoining and parallel to a lane. The buffer shall be of a width determined by the board of zoning appeals, and shall contain within such width a compact evergreen hedge or other type of foliage screening, or a combined fence and shrubbery screen, the latter facing the adjoining residential lot.
(d)
Size of driveways. A driveway exclusive of curb return radii shall be not less than 12 feet in width. A curb return radius for a driveway at its entrance to a public street shall not exceed ten feet. The maximum width of a driveway exclusive of curb return radii shall not exceed 35 feet.

Between the curb returns for any two driveways serving the same property, there shall be at least 20 feet of curb; except that this distance may be reduced to as little as five feet where it is demonstrated that restricted frontage makes this necessary in order to provide not more than two adequate driveways for the property.
(f)
Required off-street parking area shall not be reduced. No off-street parking area shall be reduced in size or encroached upon by buildings, vehicle storage, loading or unloading, or any other use where such reduction or encroachment will reduce the off-street parking and loading spaces below that required by this article.
(g)
Joint parking facilities. The off-street parking requirements for two or more neighboring uses, of the same or different types, may be satisfied by the allocation of the required number of spaces for each use in a common parking facility; provided, that the number of off-street parking spaces is not less than the sum of individual requirements; and provided further, that there be compliance with all other provisions of this chapter.
(h)
Parking provided on same lot as main building. Off-street parking spaces for one-family and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lots as the main building to be served. Off-street parking spaces for multi-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the main building to be served or not more than 300 feet distance, as measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway.

(j)
Fractional spaces. When units of measurements determining the number of required off-street parking and off-street loading spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half shall, require one off-street parking or off-street loading space.
(k)
Other use of off-street parking space prohibited. No off-street parking or loading area shall be used for the display, sale, repair, dismantling, or servicing of any vehicle, equipment, materials, or supplies.
(l)
Green space. In all zoning districts, 65 percent of the designated setback area of a lot shall consist of permanent permeable surface so as to permit the absorption of water and shall not be paved, built upon, or covered with a manmade material in such a way so as to interfere with the permeability of the surface.
3.
Remote parking facility. Where the off-street parking facility for a proposed building or use cannot be provided on the site occupied by such building or use, and is therefore provided in accordance with the provisions of this article, the applicant shall submit his application for a building permit, an instrument duly executed and acknowledged, which accepts as a condition for the issuance of a building permit or occupancy permit the continued availability of such off-street parking facilities.

ARTICLE XI. - SPECIAL USE REGULATIONS
1.
Bed and breakfast ordinance. There are two types of bed and breakfast uses defined in this ordinance, a bed and breakfast and a bed and breakfast inn. A bed and breakfast is permitted in certain residential areas and intended to be residential in nature. Any slight diversion from the bed and breakfast parameters will change a residential use to a commercial use. A bed and breakfast inn is intended for commercial districts only. Therefore, there can be no variance from the regulations specific to a bed and breakfast. Such a variance will alter the use of the property and thus require a change in the zoning district. The regulations that list requirements for both types of bed and breakfast uses are as follows:
Bed and breakfast (residential). Limited to no more than five rental units consisting of sleeping and sanitary accommodations, and one dwelling unit to be owner occupied. The owner is required to live on premise and agree to make available proof of residency. Food service limited to breakfast for guests only and to be served between the hours of 5:00 a.m.—12:00 noon. Under no circumstances will an alcoholic beverage license be issued. No less than one off street parking space per rental unit, and a minimum of two parking spaces for the owner. A buffer is required with a minimum height of six feet. One on premise sign, not to exceed 12 square feet, may either be posted on the building or on a post. A post sign may not exceed a height of six feet from the highest point of the sign. A post sign is to be located no nearer than ten feet of the right-of-way. No signs are to be allowed that are illuminated from within. Post signs may be lit with no more than two spotlights with a maximum wattage of 75 watts per bulb located on each side of the sign. Sign posted on building may be lit with no more than one spotlight with wattage not to exceed 75 watts. All sign designs must be submitted as part of the conditional use permit drawn using a ¼-inch scale. A public hearing before mayor and council is required. This permit is only valid as long as all conditions specified are met.
Bed and breakfast inns (commercial). These land uses are subject to an approved site development plan as required for all commercial development.
2.
Hotel-motel ordinance. Any area designated or to be designated for development of hotels or motels. This district shall be composed of land and structures so situated as to be well adapted to hotel or motel development where the proximity to residential and commercial districts makes it desirable to limit the manner and extent of hotel or motel operations. Development within this district is subject to approval of the governing body. The purpose of this district is to permit the normal operation of a limited number of motel and/or hotel uses under such conditions or operations as will protect the abutting residential and commercial use or other adjacent uses.
Uses permitted. Unless otherwise permitted by this ordinance, no building, land or structure shall be used except for the following:
1.
Motels;
2.
Hotels.
Conditional uses. All other uses not listed as a permitted use shall be subject to approval following a determination of conditions of fact as follows:
1.
The development of such transient lodging use of the location proposed, and in the manner proposed, will not adversely affect the abutting residential and commercial property and other adjoining uses.
2.
The site development for such a transient lodging facility provides for adequate vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation, and the resulting concentration of vehicular traffic will not present traffic problems or impede normal movement on the adjacent streets.
3.
The need for such use is justified on the basis of facts presented by the applicant to the planning and zoning commission which clearly indicates such use would be appropriate, add to the orderly development of the community, and would further the purpose and intent of this ordinance.
Permitted uses and conditional uses shall meet the standards set forth here in below:
(1)

b.
Minimum front yard setbacks from the property line shall be:
1.
Major arterial street: 85 feet.
2.

However, that there shall be a minimum of one off-street loading space for each 10,000 square feet of total floor area or fraction thereof. Each such loading space shall not be less than ten feet wide and shall be of such length as is necessary to accommodate the type of cab or truck or bus that will be loading or unloading or parking on a temporary basis. Such loading or unloading space shall not be less than 30 feet in length. Such loading and unloading spaces, including maneuvering space shall be located entirely off street. All such required off street loading and unloading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building which they are intended to serve.
(5)

(a)
Green space. Sixty-five percent of the designated setback area of a lot shall consist of permanent permeable surface so as to permit the absorption of water and shall not be paved, built upon or covered with manmade material in such a manner so as to interfere with the permeability of the surface.
(b)
Buffers. Where off street parking, loading or surface areas are proposed to be located closer than 50 feet to a lot in an R zoning district or to any lot upon which there exists a dwelling as a permitted use, and where such parking, loading or service areas are not entirely screened visually from such lot by an intervening building or structure, there shall be provided along such lot line a continuous visual buffer of a minimum of six feet. No such buffer shall extend nearer to a street right-of-way line than the established building line of the adjoining residential lot, and no buffer shall be required along a property line immediately adjoining and parallel to a lane. The buffer shall be of a width determined by the governing body, and shall contain within such width a compact evergreen hedge or other type of foliage screening, or combined fence and shrubbery screen, the latter facing the adjoining residential lot.
(c)
Number of trees. If the lot or lots to be built upon contain any trees greater than six inches in diameter such trees shall be identified on a landscape plan both before the project begins and after the project is completed.

(b)
Conditional use. In zoning districts designated WI, or B any such structures or container described in subsection (a) herein above (herein after referred to as "storage units") may be placed upon property in such districts as a conditional use. When considering whether such storage units shall be allowed on any given property in the above referred to zoning districts as a conditional use the zoning commission when making a recommendation or the zoning board of appeals when making a determination shall consider the following:
1.
Whether the property in question is adjacent to a residential zoning district.
2.
Whether the storage units can be placed adequately screened with fencing or other appropriate buffer so as not to be seen from the adjoining property or public right-of-way.
3.
Whether the storage units can be placed upon the property in question outside of public parking areas so as not to diminish parking requirements and so as not to obstruct vehicular traffic or emergency vehicles.
4.
Whether the proposed storage unit is intended to be used on a temporary basis of less than three months or on a long term basis of three months or more.
5.
Whether the applicant is asking for space for one or multiple storage units and the total square feet that is being requested to be used for storage units in relation to the total area of the property.
(c)
In considering the criteria set forth herein above the zoning commission when making a recommendation or the board of zoning appeals when making a determination shall apply minimum criteria as follows:
1.
Buffers shall be constructed of masonry, wood, vegetation, or other materials consistent with the zoning classification, and shall be designed and constructed so as to be visually compatible with the neighborhood. Upon special request and upon recommendation of the zoning commission and approval of the mayor and council, visually compatible painting on the container itself consisting of a mural may be allowed.

In a WI district the top of the storage units may extend from the ground upward no more than 30 feet except when the storage site on the subject property is of sufficient distance from any public road or adjoining property that when standing on the adjacent property or the public right-of-way the storage units would not be able to be seen because of other buildings, structures or permanent vegetation on the subject property in which event the fencing or other buffering requirements shall be at the discretion of the zoning commission when making a recommendation or the zoning board of appeals when making a decision concerning the requested conditional use. All storage units shall under any circumstances also comply with the general ordinances of the Town of Thunderbolt and also comply with the building codes so that adequate foundations are in place for any allowed storage unit.
4.
Storage units shall not be placed within 25 feet of any side or rear property line or within 25 feet of any power line. Storage units shall not be placed any closer to a (a) front property line or (b) rear or side lot property line that is adjacent to a street right-of-way than (1) the required front setback for the property, (2) the front of the nearest structure to the front property line, or (3) 25 feet whichever distance is greater from the street right-of-way.

3.
Storage units placed upon any property for construction purposes shall be allowed on the property from commencement of construction as commencement of construction is defined in Chapter 5 Article II section 5-201(2)(c) of the ordinances of the Town of Thunderbolt and such storage units shall only be allowed to stay on the property during the length of construction but in no event longer than one year and if construction is not completed within one year and the building permit is extended for no more than an additional six months.
(g)
Nonconforming uses Storage units as defined herein which are non conforming uses shall become subject to the rules concerning fencing or other appropriate buffering within 120 days after approval by the mayor and council of the buffering plan.

ARTICLE XIII. - SIGN ORDINANCE
I.
Purpose and findings. The town council has considered the aesthetic and safety reasons for limiting signage within the Town of Thunderbolt. The council has determined that signs can detract from the aesthetic beauty of the town which is located in the scenic Georgia coastal and wetland setting. Further, unregulated sign proliferation may contribute to a lowering of commercial and residential property values. Lastly, signs can be detrimental to the safety of motorists in the town which has a substantial road way, Victory Drive, passing through it. It has been found by the council by limiting the number, type, location, and dimension of signs in accordance with the following regulations will serve these substantial governmental and community interests.
In furtherance of the above stated goals the Town of Thunderbolt affirms the goals of the C.U.T.S. Transportation Amenities Program that was adopted by the City of Savannah and Chatham County and was also adopted by the Town of Thunderbolt on September 10, 2003 and notes that one of the goals of the C.U.T.S. Transportation Amenities Program is to protect and preserve canopy and palm lined historic roads. In such regard the Town of Thunderbolt hereby names Victory Drive within the jurisdiction of the Town of Thunderbolt as an amenities corridor.
The council is well aware that signs are an important means by which the town's residents, organizations, institutions, and businesses convey constitutionally protected commercial and noncommercial messages. The following regulations provide an appropriate balance between the right to communicate via signs and the protection of the community interests stated above.
The council recognizes that it is rarely proper for the government to determine the content of speech that will be allowed on signs. As such, it is the intent of the council that except as specified by the state's statutes, rules and regulations signs will be approved or disapproved entirely without regard to the content to be posted on all signs.
II.
Definitions specific to this article XIII.

IX.
Billboards. The following regulations of billboard signs shall also apply:
A.
The governing body has considered the need for commercial and noncommercial speech through the medium of billboard signs along major roads, as designated herein. These interests must be weighed against the aesthetic and safety concerns that have been enumerated elsewhere in this ordinance. After thorough consideration of these countervailing interests, the governing body has developed the following guidelines regarding billboard signs which shall to be allowed only along a designated major road in the town.
(1)
All billboards must comply with the State of Georgia's sign regulations, including, but not limited to the size and space limitations and restriction found in O.C.G.A. §§ 32-6-75 and 32-6-75.3 as now existing or hereinafter amended;

(1)
Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary, which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area?
(2)
Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development in the area?
(3)
Could traffic created by the proposed use or other use permissible under the zoning sought traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise, and traffic hazards?
(4)
Will this request place irreversible limitations on the area as it is or on future plans for it?
(5)
Is there an eminent needs for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested?
(6)
Will the proposed use substantially conflict with existing density patterns in the zone or neighborhood?
(7)
Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood?
(8)
Will the action adversely impact adjacent or nearby properties in terms of:
(i)
Environmental quality or livability, resulting from the introduction of uses or activities which would create traffic, noise, odor or visual hazards or the reduction of light and air that is incompatible with the established development pattern.
(ii)
Property values, by rendering such properties less suitable and therefore less marketable for the type of development to which they are committed or restricted in order to promote the public welfare and protect the established development pattern.
(9)
Will the action create development opportunities of such increased intensity that storm water run-off from the site cannot be controlled within previous limits, which results in adverse impacts upon existing downstream drainage problems or potential problems?
(10)
Will the action result in public service requirements such as provision of utilities or safety services which, because of the location or scale of the development, cannot be provided on an economic basis and therefore would create an actual burden to the public?
