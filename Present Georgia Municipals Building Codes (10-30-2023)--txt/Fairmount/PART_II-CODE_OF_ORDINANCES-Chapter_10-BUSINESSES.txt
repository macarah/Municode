DIVISION 5. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

FOOTNOTE(S):
(7) Editor's note— An ordinance adopted January 1, 2010, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 10-31—10-44. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, these provisions have been included as Div. 5, §§ 10-138—10-151, at the discretion of the editor.
Sec. 10-138. - Findings; public purpose.
(a)
Based on the experiences of other municipalities and local governments, and on the experiences of the city, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problem faced by the city, we take note of the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments, whether or not alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other municipalities and local governments which permit adult establishments, regardless of the serving of alcoholic beverages.
(b)
An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, public indecency, public solicitation, violent crime, prostitution, exploitation of young women, drug use, drug trafficking and loitering and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other municipalities and local governments that permit adult entertainment establishments, particular where there are two or more businesses in close proximity, and particularly in such business that serve alcohol. The mayor and council have a substantial interest in guarding against these undesirable secondary effects, to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to preserve and protect the quality of life of the city. The mayor and council also wish to guard against public indecency which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-8, and to guard against certain sexual contact provided for money, which is a crime per O.C.G.A. § 16-6-16.
(c)
The mayor and council also find that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions, particularly where there are two or more such businesses in close proximity, and particularly in such businesses that serve alcohol. Conditions experienced in other municipalities and local governments are: depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, neighborhood blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above-mentioned crime problems. The mayor and council note a substantial governmental interest in regulating this and any atmosphere conducive to violence, sexual harassment, public intoxication, prostitution, spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other negative effects. The mayor and council wish to protect against neighborhood blight and downgrade of surrounding neighborhoods due to the problems and undesirable behavior associated with adult entertainment establishments.
(d)
The mayor and council find that the above-stated undesirable secondary effects will harm the city unless these regulations are imposed to limit such adverse affects. These regulations are to minimize the adverse effects in order to preserve quality of life and to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals and to maintain the integrity of this community, especially in residential areas, and areas which have a church, school, daycare center, governmental building, library, civil center, public park or playground. These regulations are to promote these legitimate public and governmental interests in a way that will not infringe upon the constitutional right of freedom of expression. The mayor and council are not attempting to preclude adult entertainment; rather, we seek to regulate adult entertainment establishments to protect the public from the above-described, negative secondary effects. The mayor and council has narrowly tailored these regulations to combat the negative secondary effects and protect the public health, safety and welfare, while allowing reasonable avenues of protected first amendment communication. The mayor and council have found no less restrictive alternative to these regulations that would adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare. The restrictions posed by these regulations are no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest stated above.
(e)
Therefore, the purpose of this division is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to prevent increases in criminal activity and undesirable community conditions. It is recognized that such regulation cannot approach prohibition, or a protected form of expression would vanish. Therefore, this division represents an attempt to balance the competing interests or reduced criminal activity and neighborhood protection versus the rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
