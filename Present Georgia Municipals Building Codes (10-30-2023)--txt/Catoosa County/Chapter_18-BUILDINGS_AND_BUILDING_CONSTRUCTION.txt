ARTICLE IV. - RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF CERTAIN COUNTY BUILDINGS

Sec. 18-101. - Intent.
The county owns several buildings which are under the control and jurisdiction of the board of commissioners of the county. These buildings include the buildings located at the Benton Place Campus, the voting precinct buildings located throughout the county, the Nutrition Center located in the City of Ringgold, Constitution Hall located in Fort Oglethorpe, and gymnasiums which are attached to certain voting precinct buildings. During the time that some of these buildings are not used for a governmental purpose, it has been policy of the board of commissioners to allow private citizens, civic groups, churches, clubs, youth groups, senior citizens, and other associations to use some of the buildings. All of these buildings are maintained with county funds and the board of commissioners believes that they should be utilized to the fullest extent possible consistent with the primary governmental purposes for which the buildings were constructed. The board of commissioners finds that it is in the best interest of the county and the taxpayers of the county that certain user groups pay a fee to help pay for the maintenance of the buildings. The use of certain of the buildings has been dedicated to specific purposes and the management of certain buildings has been delegated to certain non-profit groups or the county has entered into contracts with the department of community affairs and others which restrict the use of some of the buildings. The board desires by this article to provide for a written policy regarding the use of the buildings, the fees which will be charged to use the buildings, the conditions in which the buildings can be used, and rules for the use of the buildings.
