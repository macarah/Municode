If the court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, Tattnall County shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against Tattnall County. If the court rules in favor of Tattnall County, the court shall determine the amount of damages to which Tattnall County is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly. The governing authority of Tattnall County shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of Tattnall County that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
(c)
In the event the person or firm against whom the claim has been submitted fails to take any of the actions allowed under subsections (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section within the time required therein, such person or firm shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights to contest the call of the bond or letter of credit.
