(1)
Merchandise, materials or supplies. Buildings or structures to be built or substantially altered which receive and distribute material or merchandise by truck shall provide and maintain off-street loading berths in sufficient number and size to adequately handle the needs of the particular use. If loading space has been provided in connection with an existing use, the loading space shall not be eliminated if elimination would result in less space than is required to adequately handle the needs of the particular use. Off-street parking areas used to fulfill the requirements of this article shall be used for loading and unloading operations except during periods of the day when not required to take care of parking needs.
(2)
Passengers. A driveway designed for continuous forward flow of passenger vehicles for the purpose of loading and unloading passengers, shall be located on the site of any school or other meeting place which is designed to accommodate more than 25 persons at one time.
(d)
Parking procedures and requirements. The administrative officer shall review all proposed uses requiring parking other than a single-family or duplex dwelling. In evaluating the proposal, the administrative officer shall use the parking requirements as guidelines and may require fewer total spaces where one or more of the following situations apply:
(1)
Two or more uses share the same parking in such a way that the hours or days or peak usage are so different that a lower total number will provide for all uses adequately.
(2)
The clientele of the use is such that a reduced number of spaces is appropriate, such as a neighborhood grocery, a business likely to be frequented by pedestrians, and so forth.
(3)
Employees are residents of the structure housing the use, such as in a home occupation.
(e)
Parking agreements. The applicant and the administrative officer may agree to a reduced number of parking spaces below the number required, with the agreement and condition that if more spaces are required in the future because of miscalculation, unanticipated growth, or other error, those spaces and associated maneuvering area shall be provided by the applicant. The planning commission may require that additional open space be kept in reserve for this purpose. An agreement shall be drafted to this effect.
(f)
Additional parking requirements. If it appears to the administrative officer that additional parking space may be necessary beyond the existing requirements, the administrative officer may require additional open area be kept in reserve for this purpose.
(g)
Street design. The street design requirements for the city are set forth in the diagram attached hereto and incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference thereto.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, §§ 700—706; Ord. of 7-6-2004, § III(707))
Sec. 30-138. - Setback requirements.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish requirements for setbacks to provide for distance from adjacent structures, protection of views and solar exposure, clear vision, and setbacks with and without approval of the administrative officer.
(b)
Distance from adjacent structures. No development of any sort shall be less than ten feet from an adjacent dwelling unit, except where development is proposed between two existing structures, and there would be practical difficulty in adhering to this requirement as determined by the administrative officer.
(c)
Protection of views and solar exposure. Where a proposed structure will eliminate more than 50 percent of an adjacent structure's views or exposure to the sun as estimated by the administrative officer and as measured from the main living area of the adjacent structure, an off-setting setback may be required by the administrative officer.
(d)
Clear vision. A clear vision area shall be maintained on the corners of all property at the intersection of two streets, or a street and a railroad. A clear vision area shall contain no planting, fence, wall, structure or temporary or permanent obstruction exceeding 36 inches in height, except for trees with branches and foliage removed to a height of eight feet above the ground, and open wire fencing that does not obscure sight more than ten percent.
(e)
With approval of the administrative officer. Zero setbacks may be allowed where it is determined that the structure will not negatively impact adjacent property, existing or future views, road expansion or availability of sunlight on adjacent property, fire regulations under the Southern Standard Building Codes are adhered to, and there is a design reason for the request, such as the obtaining of views or solar exposure, or maintenance of trees. The clear vision area, subsection (d) of this section, shall be adhered to in all cases. Applications should be filed with the city clerk and shall be considered consistent with this article if the administrative officer fails to make approval within 14 days of the date of the application.
(f)
Without approval of the administrative officer. Setbacks for lot lines shall be as follows:
MINIMUM SETBACKS FROM PROPERTY LINES
(IN FEET)
EXPAND
District Front Setbacks Rear
Setback Side
Setback
Public
Highway Other
Streets
Low-intensity (LI) 50 30 20 20
Moderate-intensity (MI) 20 20 10 10
High-intensity (HI) 15 15 6 6
Sensitive land (SL) 60 35 20 20
  An illustrated example of setbacks is in appendix (a) to this chapter.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, §§ 800—805)
Sec. 30-139. - Height requirements.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish maximum height requirements for structures.
(b)
Maximum height.
(1)
A structure shall not exceed three stories, not including basement in height measured.
(2)
The administrative officer may allow a structure to a greater height as a conditional use if:
a.
Views of adjacent property are not blocked.
b.
The structure would not block views from a public street or highway.
c.
There is a design purpose for the greater height, such as solar exposure, maintenance of trees, or a view potential.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, §§ 900, 901)
Sec. 30-140. - Buffering and screening.
(a)
Purpose. This chapter allows uses normally considered to be incompatible to exist within the same district. To reduce the impacts of adjacent uses on each other, the administrative officer shall require buffers and/or screens in certain circumstances. Generally, more intensive uses require greater amounts of buffering and screening than less intensive uses. This section establishes authority, definitions, appropriateness of buffering and screening, requirements for buffering and screening in subdivisions and other planned developments, and examples of the need for buffer and screens.
(b)
Authority. The administrative officer may require buffering and screening of proposed residential, commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential uses other than agricultural where they adjoin existing residential uses, undeveloped lands, parks or recreation areas, streams, or other uses which, may be incompatible with existing uses. The administrative officer shall consider proposed uses, the purpose and effectiveness of a buffer or screen, and its maintenance. Buffers and screens may constitute part of the required open space, open area or setbacks of a proposed use. Decisions of the administrative officer under this section may be appealed by an aggrieved person pursuant to the appeal procedures otherwise set forth in this chapter.
(c)
Definitions. The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning.
Buffer. A horizontal distance, measured perpendicularly between adjacent property lines intended to provide attractive space to reduce the impacts of proposed use on adjacent property or natural features. Buffers are required to maintain existing trees or natural vegetation, block or reduce noise, glare or other emissions, or maintain privacy.
Screen. A vertical barrier located in a limited space intended to perform a buffering effect, particularly for noise reduction or visual separation.
(d)
Where required. Buffers and screens shall be required where the administrative officer finds that the proposed use would be incompatible with existing uses (e.g., residential adjacent to a commercial or industrial use). Buffers and screens may be required jointly or separately. Buffers may be required where the proposed site is large enough, or where the buffer can be part of required open space. Buffers are preferred where there are existing trees or other natural features such as streams, and the space can be useful for residents or the public. Screens may consist of existing or planted vegetation, attractive sight-obscuring fencing, hedges or walls, earth berms, or similar techniques. Planted screens should be sufficient to obscure the proposed use within two years. Walls or earth berms should be required where noise reduction is necessary.
(e)
Appropriateness of buffers and screens. The administrative officer shall require buffers and screens only in locations and dimensions necessary to perform a stated function. The width of buffers may be adjusted to take into account natural features, traffic volumes, proposed setbacks or design, flow or natural values of streams, or other factors. The general criterion is the more intensive the proposed use and its potential for adverse impact, the greater the buffer or screen requirements.
(f)
Buffering and screening of subdivisions and other planned developments. Buffering and screening requirements for all subdivisions and other planned developments shall be in accordance with the requirements of this section.
(g)
Examples of the need for buffers and screens.
(1)
The examples listed below represent typical cases in which buffers or screens may be required:
a.
When separating incompatible land uses such as residential from commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential land uses.
b.
When separating land use activities from roads or highways.
c.
When keeping with conditional use requirements of various land use activities as shown in article IV of this chapter.
d.
When keeping with the requirements for environmental standards as shown in section 30-143.
e.
When keeping with the requirements for access as shown in section 30-145.
(2)
The owner and/or developer should become familiar with the buffering and screening requirements for each appropriate land use activity and performance district in which he plans to purchase and/or develop.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, §§ 1200—1205, Ord. of 7-6-2004, § X)
Sec. 30-141. - Traffic generation standards.
(a)
Uses with high traffic generation, as determined by the planning commission using acceptable traffic generation documents, shall be located in the high-intensity areas of the city, or within 100 feet of the intersection of two arterial streets.
(b)
Uses which would generate moderately greater traffic volumes than residential uses occupying the same land area at allowable densities shall be located on arterial streets.
(c)
Uses which would generate no more traffic than a residential use occupying the same land area at allowable density levels may be located on residential or collector streets.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 1803)
Sec. 30-142. - Storage in front yard.
Vehicles which are partially dismantled or do not have a valid state license, and other material or objects which would detract from the open space character of the yard shall not be stored more than ten days in a front yard or street side yard. Storage of recreation vehicles shall be in a side yard or rear yard, and shall not be within 30 feet of an adjacent dwelling. Vehicles will be subject to tow at owners' expense.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 1804)
Sec. 30-143. - General environmental standards.
No noise, smoke, heat, odor, fumes, dust, glare, vibration, or water pollution shall be detectable beyond the property line of the proposed use, except for occasional maintenance such as lawn care, or for normal emissions such as from wood burning stoves or fireplaces. Glare from streetlights or floodlights shall be shielded from adjacent uses, and shall be the minimum wattage necessary to illuminate the property.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 1805)
Sec. 30-144. - Streetlight or security lights.
(a)
Streetlights shall be the minimum necessary wattage to illuminate a specific area, such as an intersection, and shall be at least 200 feet apart.
(b)
Streetlights, security lights, floodlights or spotlights shall be shielded so as not to cast glare on adjacent property.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 1806)
Sec. 30-145. - Access requirement.
Every lot shall abut a street other than an alley for at least 30 feet. Where lots are created in the rear of the street fronting lots (i.e., flag lots or panhandle lots), the administrative officer may require screening on either or both sides of the access drive where it abuts an existing residence.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 1807)
Sec. 30-146. - Maintenance of minimum ordinance requirements.
No lot area, yard, other open space or off-street parking or loading area shall be reduced by conveyance or otherwise below the minimum requirements of this article, except by dedication or conveyance for a public use, or shall be used as a dual use for another property except where specifically allowed.
(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, § 1808)
Secs. 30-147—30-177. - Reserved.
