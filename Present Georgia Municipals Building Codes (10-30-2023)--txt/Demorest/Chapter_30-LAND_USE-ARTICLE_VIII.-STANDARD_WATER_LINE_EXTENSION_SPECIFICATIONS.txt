Sec. 30-298. - Backfilling trenches.
(a)
The backfilling of pipeline trenches shall be started immediately after the pipe work has been inspected and approved by the engineer. Backfill material shall consist of fine loose earth free of large clods, stones, vegetable matter, debris, and/or other objectionable material. Backfill shall be carefully deposited in six-inch layers (before compaction) on each side of the pipe and then thoroughly and carefully tamped or rammed around the pipe with approved power tools until enough material has been placed and compacted to provide a cover of not less than one foot over the top of the pipe. If the trench extends along or across streets, roadways, proposed roadways, usable alleys or sidewalks, the remainder of the trench shall be backfilled and tamped to its full depth in the manner specified above with a minimum density of 95 percent standard proctor for the full depth. Otherwise, it may be filled with loose material without compaction. Where tamping of material is not required for the full depth of the trench, this material (from a height of one foot above the pipe upward) shall be as hereinbefore specified, except that a broken stone content of not more than 50 percent by volume will be allowed of stones not exceeding six-inch maximum dimensions, provided that these stones are thoroughly mixed with earth.
(b)
Before being placed under pavement, earth material for backfill which is, in the opinion of the engineer, too dry to allow thorough compaction, shall receive an admix of sufficient water prior to compaction to insure such compaction. Earth material considered by the engineer to have excessive water content shall not be placed.
(c)
Backfill material having less than a ten percent clay content may be compacted by puddling with water in lieu of tamping when authorized by the engineer. Such puddling shall consist of applying water under pressure to the entire content of the trench beginning near the trench bottom and working through pipes or well points.
(d)
Backfill materials used shall contain a sufficient amount of moisture for proper compaction. In areas to be paved and areas not to be paved but inside road rights-of-way, the backfill shall be brought up in accordance with section 30-300(a) and compacted to not less than 95 percent of standard proctor.
(e)
Compaction tests will be required at varying depths and intervals determined by the engineer. Tests shall be made by a qualified independent testing laboratory selected by the engineer. The owner shall pay for all compaction testing. However, in the event that such tests fail to meet the requirements of the specifications, the expense of such tests shall be borne by the contractor.
(f)
Where the test results indicate that compaction is less than the allowable minimum specified in section 30-300(a), the material will be removed to the depths and limits determined by the engineer and new material placed and compacted to minimum standards at no additional cost to the owner.
(g)
Where excavation has been made within the limits of easements across private property, the top one foot of backfill material shall consist of fine loose earth free of large clods, vegetable matter, debris, stone and/or other objectionable materials.
(h)
Where tamping of backfill material is not required for the full depth, the backfill material shall be neatly rounded over the trench to a sufficient height to allow for settlement to grade after consolidation. Any deficiency in the quantity of materials for backfilling the trenches or for filling the depressions caused by settlement shall be supplied by the contractor.
(i)
Where pipe trenches are cut across pavement, the contractor shall construct a temporary surface over the cut by filling and tamping the upper six inches of the cut with selected gravel or crushed stone which will not disintegrate under the traffic and which shall be maintained in good condition under traffic until the permanent pavement has been constructed. No specific payment will be allowed for temporary surfacing.
(j)
All backfilling shall be done in a manner which will not disturb or injure the pipe or structure over or against which it is being placed. Any pipe or structure injured, damaged or moved from its proper alignment during backfilling operations shall be opened up and then rebackfilled as herein specified.
(k)
The contractor shall replace all surface materials and shall restore drives, curbing, sidewalks, gutters, shrubbery, fences, sod, and other disturbed surfaces to a condition equal to that before the work began, furnishing all labor and materials incidental thereto. No payment for such items shall be made unless specifically stated in these specifications and or in the bid schedule.
