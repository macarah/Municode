ARTICLE IV. - CONDITIONAL USES

Sec. 30-95. - Purpose.
This chapter has been developed to be flexible by permitting mixed land uses (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial) to occur under specified conditions. The purpose of the conditional use process is to allow a wide variety of uses in each intensity district. The criteria and standards are intended to assist in facilitating the goals of this chapter. This article provides for review by the administrative officer, conditional use considerations, public hearing on proposed conditional use, multifamily or apartment dwellings, subdivisions, and other planned developments, schools; public utility or communication facility, single-section and multisection manufactured homes, primary commercial uses, high traffic generation commercial uses, commercial recreation, eating and drinking establishments, industry (nonwater-dependent or related), meeting halls, churches, and lodges, mining and/or grading, public facilities and services, home occupation and industries, accessory uses, agriculture, forest management, and allowable use matrix.

(Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, ยง 1107)
Sec. 30-99. - Single-section manufactured homes (SSMHs) and multisection manufactured homes (MSMHs).
(a)
The following standards apply to all single-section manufactured homes (SSMHs) not located in a manufactured home park:
(1)
Single-section manufactured homes (SSMHs) not located in a manufactured home park shall be owner occupied. The manufactured home owner must also own the land on which the home is to be placed. Renter occupied manufactured homes must be located in a manufactured home park. A manufactured home park is a privately owned place where two or more manufactured homes used for human occupancy are parked on a lot, tract or parcel of land under the same ownership. A manufactured home park may contain either or both single-section and multisection manufactured homes. No two manufactured homes may occupy the same lot, tract or parcel of land under the same ownership.
(2)
No SSMH shall be located within 500 feet of another SSMH. Variances of the 500-foot separation requirement will be considered if it becomes necessary for the better placement of a new structure.
(3)
When a SSMH is placed, evidence in writing that 75 percent of all persons living on property within a one-fourth of a mile radius of the proposed location of the SSMH affirmatively consent and agree to the placing of the SSMH is required. In the event a parcel of land exists within the one-fourth of a mile radius aforementioned which is not occupied, then the owner of the property shall, for the purposes of this article, be deemed an occupant of the land for the purposes of arriving at the percentage of persons consenting. Evidence should consist of signatures on forms provided by the city clerk.
(4)
It is unlawful for any person to construct, alter, or extend any SSMH within the city limits unless he holds a valid building permit issued by the administrative officer, in his name, and for the specific placement, construction, alteration, or extension, erection, movement or enlargement proposed. No permit for MSMH or SSMH placement will be accepted until all signatures required are on the signature form provided by the clerk and attached to the building permit and fees paid. It is the responsibility of the person who wants to place the multisection manufactured home or single-section manufactured home to get the full 75 percent requirement of signatures within the one-fourth of a mile radius.
a.
All adjacent property owners must affirmatively consent to the placement of the multisection or single-section mobile home. Adjacent property owners are those whose property boundaries touch the applicant's property on all sides. Intersections of roads or streets shall not be a cause to separate boundary owners from applicant's property and such roads or streets shall serve only as property lines.
b.
A "temporary" category shall be established to allow for temporary or business reasons. Time allowable shall not exceed six months. No signatures are required, but a permit and administrative officer or planning commission permission is required before placement of the manufactured home. A fee shall be charged for the permit according to the set fee for a building permit and it shall be followed. A decal shall be issued for the temporary period.
c.
Multisection mobile home or single-section mobile home owners wishing to replace their owned MSMH or SSMH with a new home may do so without getting signatures. Those MSMH and SSMH owners will fill out a building permit and pay a fee as in building a new structure. One exception would be that if three complaints have been lodged against the property owner, the property owner will have to get the required signatures as if placing a not previously placed manufactured home. The complaints will be ones which have substance and concern, things that would have constituted a nuisance or disturbance. The discretion of the planning commission will be used in dealing with the complaints and determining if they are permissible in such a manner as to prohibit the replacement of a manufactured home. A decal will also be issued if all the above procedures are in compliance and have been completed fully. If the homeowner is in compliance, the manufactured home that has been replaced shall not be allowed to remain on the property as an additional structure.
d.
Those renting units of a single-section manufactured home or multisection manufactured home existing before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and whose owners wish to update their (manufactured home) status to new multisection manufactured home or single-section manufactured home on the site, shall be required to get the 75 percent signatures within one-fourth of a mile radius as well as adjacent property owners. A permit will also be required, and the required fees will be paid before any change in the owner's manufactured home status as a rental unit is undertaken.
(5)
All SSMHs shall be constructed in conformance with state and federal specifications, and shall be placed in conformance with the standards of this chapter.
(6)
The condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage, and ground slope must not create hazards to the property, or to the health or safety of the residents. The SSMH site must not be exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors, or other adverse conditions, and no part subject to flooding or erosion can be used for any purpose that exposes people or property to danger.
(7)
Exposed ground surfaces on SSMH sites must be protected with a vegetative growth that prevents soil erosion, standing puddles, or dust. If this is not possible, such areas may be covered with a solid material such as stone, or they may be paved.
(8)
The ground surface of all SSMH sites must be equipped to drain all surface water in a safe, efficient manner, either through grading or installation of drains.
(9)
When an accessory structure with an area of more than 25 square feet is attached to a SSMH or located on the same lot, it must, for purposes of separation requirements, be considered part of the SSMH.
(10)
No roof shall be constructed over a SSMH independent of the structure. Cabanas and awnings may be added if they are compatible in appearance with the main structure, and a building permit is obtained prior to construction.
(11)
