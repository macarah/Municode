B.
Flat roofs, irrespective of roof slope, shall be completely enclosed on each building elevation with a cornice line, or parapet wall, that is no less than 24 inches in height. The cornice line, or parapet wall, shall be visually compatible with the architectural character of the building design and shall utilize identical materials. Where mechanical service elements such as, but not limited to, air conditioning units, communications equipment, condensers, exhaust fans, generators, HVAC mechanical equipment systems or other related elements are placed on top of the flat roof, the height of the cornice line, or parapet wall, shall be raised to a point that is not less than 12 inches in height above the height of the tallest of such mechanical service elements, so as to conceal all such elements from view on each building elevation. Where more than three occupancies exist within a single structure, the cornice line or parapet wall of the individual spaces occupied by each occupancy shall be architecturally varied to provide visual interest from the street.
C.
Where pitched roofs are utilized, the pitch or slope shall be no less than 8:12 and no more than 12:12, rise to run, provided that pitched roofs used to provide shade for balconies, decks, patios, porches and pedestrian paths shall be sloped at a ratio that is not less than 2:12.

Following the pre-application conference, ten copies of the site plan, elevation drawings of each building facade and landscape plan shall be submitted, as applicable, and shall be reviewed for compliance with the Commercial District requirements by the zoning official.
D.
All exterior demolition, new construction (including building additions), expansions of outdoor dining areas or any construction that results in increased lot coverage or modification of the building footprint shall be subject to the pre-application conference and submittal requirements. Routine repair and maintenance and interior improvements are not subject to the pre-application conference provided they involve no change of use. For example, a proposal involving conversion of a retail store to a restaurant would require a pre-application conference to determine impact on such facilities as restrooms and parking.
E.
The site plan shall describe the proposed development and convey a sense of the mass, scale and extent of the development. The site plan shall depict the location of blocks and streets, building relationships and arrangement and public open space to be provided in complying with the requirements of the Commercial District.

H.
Once the zoning official determines the required elements have been covered by the site plan, it shall be placed on the next available council agenda for a meeting to be held no earlier than five days from date of submission. The mayor and council shall review the site plan, may question the applicant, and shall make a determination as to whether the site plan furthers the city's policies and goals for development of the Commercial District. The mayor and council may accept the site plan as submitted, request revisions to bring the site plan more in line with city policy, or reject the plan as not meeting the policies and interests of the city.
