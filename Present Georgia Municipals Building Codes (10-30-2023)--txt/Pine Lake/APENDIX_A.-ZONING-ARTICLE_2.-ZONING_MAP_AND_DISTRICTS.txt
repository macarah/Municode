Sec. 2-8. - Rules for interpreting the official zoning map.
The following rules govern the interpretation of the official zoning map.
A.
Boundaries: Where boundaries may generally follow the centerline of streets, alleys, easements, waterways, and the like, boundaries shall be interpreted as following such centerlines unless boundaries are clearly shown on the official zoning map as following the property lines adjacent to such areas. In the event of a closure of a public street, alley or other right-of-way, the boundary shall be construed as the center line of such street, alley or public right-of-way; unless a specific amendment is made otherwise.
B.
Dimensions: Where dimensions are not otherwise indicated on the map, the scale of the map shall govern.
C.
Error of omission of district indication: Where a district designation is not indicated for an area of the official zoning map, it shall be construed to be zoned R-1. Upon discovery of such omission, unless research reveals the correct official zoning status of the land, a corrective amendment shall be initiated by the city.
D.
Boundary changes with changes in jurisdictional boundaries: Where territory is removed from the jurisdictional limits of the city, zoning boundaries shall move with the jurisdictional limits. Where territory is added to the city, a zoning amendment shall be adopted concurrent with such annexation.
E.
Zoning Official action in case of uncertainty of map: Where natural or man-made features existing are inconsistent with those shown on the official zoning map, or in any other circumstances of inconsistency not covered above, upon request by the mayor, council, or by any affected property owner, or on the zoning official's own initiative upon determination that such inconsistencies exist, the zoning official shall make a finding and interpretation concerning the boundaries involved in accord with the intent and purposes found in this ordinance.
F.
Divided lots of record: It is the policy of the city that no new zoning shall be approved that divides an existing lot of record into two or more zoning districts. Where an owner of property desires to make use of property under two or more zoning districts, the owner shall be required to subdivide the property in such a manner that all portions of the subdivision, meet the standards of the affected districts. In cases where the zoning district boundary divides a lot of record at the time the boundary was established, the zoning official, upon application by the owner of the property owner or duly authorized agent, shall make findings and prepare recommendations as to this boundary line. The matter may then be advertised for rezoning in accordance with the Zoning Procedures Law.
