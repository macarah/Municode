ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 38-1. - Indecent entertainment, conduct or attire in establishments selling or allowing alcoholic beverages.
(a)
Findings of fact; purpose. Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb and Cobb County, Georgia; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; which experiences the board of commissioners believes are relevant to the problems faced by the county, and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment, adult entertainment or erotic entertainment, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow or encourage nudity or semi-nudity.
(b)
Prohibited acts. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are not permitted upon premises licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcoholic beverages, or upon premises licensed under the business and occupational ordinances of the county and in which alcoholic beverages are consumed, allowed or dispensed on the premises:
(1)
The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages, while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals;
(2)
Live entertainment in business establishments which provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing, or the performance of obscene acts or acts which simulate:
a.
Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law;
b.
The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or
c.
The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals;
(3)
The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproduction depicting any of the acts described in subsection (2) of this subsection which are obscene under state law; or
(4)
The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct prohibited in this section.
(c)
Exemptions. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this section shall or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums or the like where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or mainstream activity of such establishment.
