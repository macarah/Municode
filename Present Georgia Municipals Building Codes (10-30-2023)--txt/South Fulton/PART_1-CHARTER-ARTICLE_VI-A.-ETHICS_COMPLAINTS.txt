(H.B. 1019(Act 414), p.____)
Sec. 6-A.11. - Subpoenas.
(a)
Any request for a subpoena made by a party to the ethics panel shall be made at least five business days prior to the ethics hearing date, and shall state the names and addresses for whom the subpoenas are to be issued and the date and time for the witnesses to appear. Any party requesting a subpoena shall also notify the opposing party in writing as to whom the subpoenas will be issued. A failure to provide such notification or to timely request a subpoena under this subsection may result in a waiver of the right to subpoena such witness.
(b)
The ethics panel adopts O.C.G.A. § 45-20-9(c), which states:
'Subpoenas shall be issued without discrimination between public and private parties. When a subpoena is disobeyed, any party may apply to the superior court of the county where the ethics hearing is being held for an order requiring obedience. Failure to comply with such order shall be cause for punishment as for contempt of court. The costs of securing the attendance of witnesses, including fees and mileage, shall be computed and assessed in the same manner as prescribed by law in civil cases in the superior court. Once issued a subpoena may be quashed by the [ethics panel] or any administrative law judge if it appears that the subpoena was used primarily as a means of harassment, that the testimony or documents sought are cumulative, that the testimony or documents sought are not relevant, that the testimony or documents sought are not material, that to respond to the subpoena would be unduly burdensome, or that for other good reasons basic fairness dictates that the subpoena should not be enforced.'
(c)
It is intended that O.C.G.A. § 24-13-25 shall apply to require $25.00 per diem as a witness fee for any witnesses who are not city employees. City employees shall not be entitled to receive a witness fee during hours in which they are being paid by the city for performance of job duties. Additionally, if a witness resides outside the city, O.C.G.A. § 24-13-25 shall apply to require the $25.00 per diem witness fee and $0.20 per mile for travel expenses as a condition for appearance. Consistent with O.C.G.A. § 24-13-25, any subpoenas issued on behalf of the city will not require payment of the above-stated fees. If applicable, O.C.G.A. § 24-13-28 shall govern issuance of subpoenas to off-duty law enforcement officers.
(d)
The complainant and the respondent shall be individually responsible for costs of securing the attendance of any subpoenaed witness, including the costs of fees and mileage as applicable, and shall be individually responsible for service of any subpoena.
(H.B. 1019(Act 414), p.____)
Sec. 6-A.12. - Disciplinary action.

This discretion shall not entitle the city council to override a determination by the ethics panel that a violation has occurred.
(d)
In addition to any other remedy provided herein, upon determination of a violation of this article, the ethics panel may recommend to the mayor and the city council in writing that any contract, bid, or change order that was the subject of the violation be cancelled or rescinded. The city council shall retain the discretion to determine whether such a cancellation or rescission would be in the best interest of the city and shall not be bound in any way by a recommendation of the ethics panel.
(e)
In addition to any other remedy provided herein, the ethics panel may also forward its written decision to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office, the Office of the Attorney General of Georgia, or the Office of the Governor for appropriate action.
(H.B. 1019(Act 414), p.____)
Sec. 6-A.13. - Judicial review.

The application for the writ shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision of the city council with respect to the punishment to be imposed. If the ethics panel dismisses the ethics complaint or finds no violation to have been proven by clear and convincing evidence after an ethics hearing, the writ shall be filed within 30 days of the written dismissal or decision. Judicial review shall be based upon the record. No party shall be entitled to a de novo appeal.

(d)
An ethics complaint is not frivolous if the complainant reasonably believes that facts exist to support the claim and either reasonably believes that under those facts the ethics complaint is valid under this article or acts upon the advice of counsel sought in good faith and given after full disclosure of all relevant facts within his or her knowledge and information.
(e)
In deciding if an ethics complaint is a wrongful use of this article, the ethics panel shall consider the following, without limitation:
(1)

(2)
The nature and type of publicity surrounding the filing of the ethics complaint, and the degree of participation by the complainant in publicizing the fact that an ethics complaint was filed;

(4)
If respondent is a candidate for election to office, the existence and nature of any relationship between the complainant and any candidate or group opposing the respondent;

(h)
Upon a finding by the ethics panel that clear and convincing evidence of a violation of this section was presented at the ethics hearing, the ethics panel shall recommend to the mayor and the city council that the city impose any combination of the following penalties and actions:
(1)
Public reprimand;
(2)
Criminal prosecution for perjury; and
(3)
Payment of costs and attorney's fees associated with the handling and processing of the ethics complaint.

Sec. 6-A.17. - Reimbursement for reasonable attorney's fees.
In the event an ethics complaint brought against the respondent arising out of their official duties is dismissed, either by voluntary withdrawal of the complaint by the petitioner or by action of the ethics panel or superior court dismissing the complaint as unfounded or otherwise subject to dismissal, the respondent shall be entitled to reimbursement from the city for reasonable attorney's fees incurred in defending said ethics complaint. Upon securing a final determination by the ethics panel or superior court of the complaint being dismissed, to include voluntary withdrawal of the complaint by the petitioner, the respondent shall submit a copy of the order making such findings or the petitioner's withdrawal, whichever is applicable, to the city manager along with a copy of all applicable itemized attorney's fees incurred in defending same. The itemized attorney's fees shall have attorney time and tasks broken down in one-tenth of an hour increments along with the attorney's hourly fee, coupled with a sworn statement by the attorney that the amount submitted for repayment is the same amount for which the respondent would otherwise have been responsible, or has already paid. Other than attorney time, no other expense or fees shall be subject to reimbursement. The city manager shall submit the attorney fee statement to the city attorney for a determination of reasonableness, of which determination shall be provided in writing to the city manager. Upon all or a portion of the fees being deemed reasonable, the city manager shall submit all documentation to the city finance department for issuance of a reimbursement check to the respondent or respondent's attorney, at the respondent's discretion. Reimbursement under this paragraph shall not exceed $7,500.00 per ethics complaint, unless otherwise approved in a resolution approved by a majority of the city council.
