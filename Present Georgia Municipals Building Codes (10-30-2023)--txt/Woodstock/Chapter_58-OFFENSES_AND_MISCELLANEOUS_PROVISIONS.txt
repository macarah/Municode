ARTICLE III. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS

Sec. 58-71. - Introduction.
It is hereby determined that:
Discharges to the City of Woodstock, Georgia's (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "city") municipal separate storm sewer system (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "MS4") that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's MS4 from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's MS4;
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the city's MS4;
Therefore, the city adopts this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the city's MS4. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city's MS4 is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
