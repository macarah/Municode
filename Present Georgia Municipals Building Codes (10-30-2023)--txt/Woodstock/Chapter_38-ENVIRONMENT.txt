The purpose of this chapter is to exercise the police power in relation to public nuisances and abatement of such nuisances, to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and to promote the economic development of the city. It is also the purpose of this chapter to prevent and prohibit those conditions which reduce the value of private property, interfere with enjoyment of public and private property, create and constitute fire and other safety and health hazards, and generally create a menace to the health and welfare of the public and contribute to the degradation of the character of neighborhoods and depreciation of property values. It is necessary for the public health, safety and welfare to regulate, prevent and prohibit conditions which may constitute disorderly, disturbing, unsafe, unsanitary, fly-producing, rat-harboring and/or disease-causing places, conditions or objects. It is also necessary for the public social and economic welfare to regulate, prevent and prohibit conditions that degrade the city's scenic attractiveness and livability and its economic development.

(Ord. No. 2797, Exh. A, 2-24-2014)
Sec. 38-32. - Graffiti.
(a)
Definitions.
Graffiti shall mean any inscriptions, words, figures, paintings, or other defacements that are written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any public or private building, structures, places or property without prior authorization, in accordance with all ordinances of the city, by means of any aerosol paint container, broad-tipped marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching equipment, brush, chalk, dye, or other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark.
Graffiti abatement shall mean the abatement procedure that identifies graffiti, issues notices to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures or removes such graffiti in absence of a response.
Gum label shall mean any substance consisting of a material such as, but not limited to, paper, fabric, cloth, plastic, vinyl and/or any other similar material, where the material also contains one or more surfaces containing a substance such as, but not limited to, any material commonly known as an adhesive or glue, which cannot be removed from the surface in an intact condition and with minimal efforts, including, but not limited to, decals, stickers, patches, stamps, or labels.
Private contractor shall mean any person with whom the City of Woodstock, Georgia shall have contracted to remove graffiti.
(b)
Findings; nuisance. The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and is destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts quickly to require the removal of graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the City of Woodstock, Georgia, and its residents. Further the city finds that rapid or prompt removal (less than 72 hours) serves as a deterrent to future defacement and such defacement is less likely to reappear. The city finds that graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitute a nuisance.
(c)
Graffiti prohibited. It shall be a violation of this section for any person to write, draw, carve, scratch, erect, or place upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage, other structure, tree or real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing inscription, figure, or mark of the type which is commonly known or referred to as "graffiti". Any such "graffiti" shall be removed or eradicated within 72 hours of its first appearance.
(d)
Violation. A violation of any provision of this section shall be punishable by fine, restitution, or other penalty as the city council deems just and reasonable provided, however, no fine shall exceed the amount authorized by the City Charter.
(e)
Notice to remove.
(1)
Whenever the city's code enforcement officer or his designee determines that graffiti exists on any private property which is visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk, or other right-of-way or any public park or property, the code enforcement officer shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall be given three days from the date of notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city.
(2)
The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be a written notice and shall be served upon the owner(s) of the affected property, as such owner(s) names and address appears on the latest Property Tax Assessment Rolls of Cherokee County, Georgia. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent to the property address. The notice may be served in any of the following manners:
a.
By personal service to owners, occupant or manager of the property;
b.
By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner; or
c.
By posting a copy on the property.
(3)
Removal by city; lien. Upon failure of the owner(s) to comply with the notice to remove, the code enforcement officer shall issue a notice to appear before the judge of the municipal court. The judge of the municipal court shall be permitted to allow the city or a private contractor to remove the graffiti and charge any costs associated with removal to the owner of the property. The judge of the municipal court shall not be limited to removal by the city or private contractor and may allow any fines, restitution or other penalty to become a lien against the property.

(a)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(b)
The lien described in this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the code official shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the city tax collector.

It shall be the duty of the city tax collector to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch 4 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); however, the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply.

The tax collector shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by this section unless such costs are waived by resolution of the city governing authority. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the city to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(e)
The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
