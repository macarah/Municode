(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(7), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-69. - Water restrictions.
(a)
Any condition which causes the normal supply of water pressure to be reduced excessively requires that priority use of water be implemented. These conditions include any of the following:
(1)
High water demand.
(2)
Drought and excessive heat conditions.
(3)
Power failures.
(4)
Supply interruptions.
(5)
Water main breakage or failures.
(b)
A general ranking of water uses in decreasing order of importance would be as follows:
(1)
Household use.
(2)
Public necessity.
(3)
Livestock.
(4)
Industrial and commercial.
(5)
Construction.
(6)
Irrigation.
(7)
Non-essential firefighting.
(8)
Swimming pools.
(9)
Car washing.
(10)
Street cleaning, line flushing, hydrant testing, lawn watering, etc.
(c)
The city proposes to establish an emergency conservation plan, as outlined in this subsection, which places restrictions on lower priority water usage during periods when water use reduction is urgent. The following subsections outline a drought/emergency conservation plan for the city. The plan is divided into four stages of emergency conditions briefly described as minor, moderate, severe, and critical.
(1)
Stage one: Minor emergency condition. The city will, when minor conditions occur, first put the following priority conservation methods in place.
a.
Public notices will be placed in places of business throughout the city and in the local newspaper requesting that customers curtail the use of any unnecessary water. This will be primarily aimed at limiting the practice of watering laws, gardens, washing cars and other practices that are not essential during emergency conditions.
b.
In addition, fire departments and others will be asked to curtail water main flushing, dust control and other non-essential uses of water. This request is made by the mayor. Under minor conditions, these reductions shall be on a voluntary compliance basis.
(2)
Stage two: Moderate water emergency. If conditions degenerate from what was considered a minor condition to a moderate emergency, the following additional steps may be taken:
a.
First, the posting of notices would be increased and the newspaper notice would include a release from the mayor explaining the degree of severity of the problem. The mayor will make a stronger appeal for voluntary reductions in water usage.
b.
The same water reduction methods that were outlined in the minor emergency section would be implemented in the moderate, with the addition that city crews and, in some cases, public safety officials will be asked to actually field monitor water usage. If customers are observed using water for non-essential purposes, they will be contacted on-site and asked to curtail water use. After two requests are made, if the customer fails to comply, his water service may be disconnected at the meter and a reconnection fee may be charged to return the customer to service.
(3)
Stage three: Severe water emergency.
a.
In cases where the city deems conservation measures required to be severe, the mayor, as well as the city council, will make appeals to the customers of the system. In addition, news briefings will be given to large users outlining the problem.
b.
A much more severe ban on water usage will be required, and prohibition of all public water usage not required for health and safety will be activated. The prohibition will allow no outside water usage that is not absolutely essential for health and safety. No water-cooled air conditions will be allowed to run without recirculation.
c.
Businesses, such as car washes and laundromats, will be asked to curtail operations for limited periods. High water using industries will be asked to curtail operations if they operate in more than one shift.
d.
The penalties for ignoring the water use warnings will result in shut-off of water service to the customer after one request.
(4)
Stage four: Critical.
a.
When the emergency becomes critical, measures implemented for a severe emergency will be continued along with additional measures.
b.
Prohibitions will be imposed on the use of any water for outside activities not essential or required for health and safety.
c.
Any business that is a high water user will be required to curtail operations for limited periods until the water emergency has subsided.
d.
The mayor will also issue a request that individual residents conserve in other specific ways.
e.
In addition to the personnel of the city, the police department will be asked to monitor unnecessary use of water.
f.
The city will take measures to reduce the pressure to the minimum permissible level in areas where it is possible to do so.
g.
As a last resort, the city will temporarily terminate service to selected portions of the system at alternate intervals.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(8), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-70. - Use during fire alarms.
During all fire alarms, the use, by persons other than municipal firefighters, of hoses and other apparatuses maintaining a constant flow of water is absolutely forbidden.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(9), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-71. - Water rates.
(a)
The water rate schedule for the city shall be as established by the city council from time to time.
(b)
The minimum consumption rates shall apply for usage up to 2,000 gallons. The commodity charge shall apply to usage for each 50 gallons in excess of the minimum usage (2,000 gallons).
(c)
In instances where a single meter serves a lot with multiple residences, the owner of such lot shall be the account holder and responsible party.
(d)
The minimum charges as provided in the rate schedule shall be applied to the number of residential units to determine the minimum monthly charge. Once the minimum amount has been exceeded, the monthly charge shall be determined by multiplying the rate to the gallons consumed.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(10), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-72. - Billing.
(a)
Water meters will be read at the end of the month, as near as possible. Bills shall be mailed on or before the first of the month. All water bills shall be due on or before the 15th of the month. If not paid by the 15th, a penalty of ten percent of the amount due will be added thereto and paid by the user.
(b)
If the bill is not paid by the next meter reading, the service will be disconnected.
(1)
Upon disconnection of water service for non-payment of the bill, the security deposit shall be applied by the city toward settlement of the account. Any remaining deposit shall be refunded to the consumer; however, if the security deposit is insufficient to cover the bill, the city may proceed to collect the balance in the usual way provided by law for the collection of debts.
(2)
There shall be a disconnect fee in an amount as established by the city council from time to time for each meter disconnected for non-payment. This charge is effective from the time the cut-off notice is given to water employees for turn-off. It is due and payable at that time.
(3)
Service disconnected for non-payment of bill will be restored only after bills are paid in full, such security deposits as required by the mayor and council is made and service charge to be determined by the city council from time to time is paid.
(4)
The city reserves the right to discontinue its service, without notice, for the following additional reasons:
a.
To prevent fraud or abuse.
b.
Consumer's willful disregard of the city's policies.
c.
Emergency repairs.
d.
Insufficiency of water supply due to circumstances beyond the city's control.
e.
Legal processes.
f.
Direction of public authorities.
g.
Strike, riot, fire, flood, unavoidable accident.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(11), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-73. - Minimum charges.
The minimum charge, as provided in the rate schedule, shall be made for such a connection subscribed for. Water furnished for a given lot shall be used on that lot only, and, except for fire protection, the city shall not, under any circumstances, furnish water free of charge to anyone. All residential and commercial buildings within the city limits, not served by the city but having city water connected to their property, shall pay a minimum water demand fee.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(12), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-74. - City's responsibility and liability.
The city shall run a service line from its distribution to the property being served. No service charge, other than the connection fee referred to in section 30-65, will be made.
(1)
The city may make connections to service other properties not adjacent to its lines upon payment of reasonable cost for the extensions of its distribution lines as may be required to render such service.
(2)
The city shall install a water meter at or near the property line or, at the city's option, on the consumer's property within three feet of the property line.
(3)
The city reserves the right to refuse service unless the consumer's lines or piping are installed in such a manner as to prevent cross-connections or backflow.
(4)
The city reserves the right to refuse service to any additional customers when capacity will not permit.
(5)
Under normal circumstances, the consumer will be notified of any anticipated interruptions of service by the city.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(13), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-75. - Consumer's responsibility and liability.
Water furnished by the city shall be used for consumption by the customer, members of his household and employees only, and the customer shall not sell water to any other person or permit any other person to use said water, except as hereinafter provided herein Water shall not be used in a manner which would interfere with domestic consumption in the area served. Disregard of this rule shall be sufficient cause for refusal and/or discontinuance of service.
(1)
Where a meter or meter box is placed on the premises of a consumer, a suitable place shall be provided by the consumer, unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader.
a.
When a customer's meter is not located on the public right-of-way or within three feet of the customer's property line, the customer will be responsible for all repair to that line, except for the part on the public right-of-way. The city will maintain the meter.
b.
If a customer does not wish to maintain all of the service line on the public right-of-way, he should notify the city in writing and city employees will relocate the meter back to the right-of-way.
(2)
The consumer shall have and maintain a private cut-off valve on the consumer's side of the meter.
(3)
The consumer's piping and apparatuses, beyond the connection place provided by the city, shall be installed and maintained by the consumer at the consumer's expense, in a safe and efficient manner, in accordance with the sanitary regulations of the state health department.
(4)
The consumer is liable for any negligent damage to the property of the water system located on his premises.
(5)
In order to be received as a customer and entitled to receive water from the city's water system, all applicants must show that any and all wells located on their property are not physically connected to the city's water system (AWWA-approved double check valves installed at the water meter on the customer's side will waive this requirement) and all applicants, by becoming customers of the city, covenant and agree that, as long as they continue to be customers of the city, they will not permit the connection of any private wells on their property to the city's water system. Customers must not connect the city's water system to any other form of water supply. Customers currently having an unapproved water source connected to their plumbing, upon notification, will have to demonstrate its discontinuance or purchase and install an AWWA-approved double check valve.
a.
The customer shall furnish and have installed a double check valve-backflow preventer assembly in a size to match that of the required service piping. The DCV-BFP assembly shall include a full port ball valve on the inlet and outlet sides and a union or swivel coupling nut between the device and each valve. Unions or swivel coupling nuts are to be integral with the device or valves. The device shall have three ball threaded plugs. A fourth test cock shall be provided on the upstream side of the inlet shut-off valve. All components of the assembly, including the valve handles and assembly bolts, shall be equal in corrosion resistance to bronze or stainless steel, to resist electrolysis. Access to both check-in devices shall be by top and/or side entry for maintenance and repair of all interior parts shall have replaceable seats.
b.
Approved assemblies include: Ames; Buckner; Conbraco; Claval; Febco; Phlegmatic; Heresy; Watts; Wilkins.
c.
Installation instructions. The DCV-BFP assembly shall not be buried in earth but installed in a utility box adjacent to, or as close as practical to, the outlet side of the meter installation. Under no condition will any connection be allowed between the service meter and a backflow preventer used for system containment.
(6)
If one meter is currently serving several premises or dwelling units having a common owner, the landlord or owner shall be considered the city's customer and shall be billed accordingly. The meter size of this setting shall be no smaller than 1½ inch.
(7)
If one meter is currently serving several units or dwelling places and there is no common deed or titled owner and the units have separate power and/or gas service, and individual piping, the consumer, upon notification, shall make application for water service within the city. Failure to do so within the specified timeframe cited will result in the common meter being billed the appropriate demand commodity charge times the number of units the meter is now serving. Continued disregard of the notification could result in the discontinuance of service.
(8)
Owners of buildings or structures having a common piping system, but being individually owned, upon notification, shall, at their expense, re-pipe their building as not to be connected to any adjacent plumbing system. When re-piping is complete, the customer will notify city hall, and meter and fee arrangements will be set by the mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(14), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-76. - Change of occupancy.
Not less than three days' notice must be given, in person or in writing, at city hall, to discontinue water service or to change occupancy.
(1)
In the event of sale of property to which water service is provided and payment for such service is in delinquent status, service to the seller shall not be provided at any new location, or, if currently served at another location, such service shall be discontinued until any delinquent bill is paid.
(2)
A new owner of property to which water service had previously been provided shall apply for service within 48 hours after occupying the premises. Failure to do so will make them liable for paying for water service since the last meter reading.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(15), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-77. - Meter readings, billing, and collections.
(a)
Bills to customers for water service shall be mailed out on such day of each month as may be determined as desirable by the city. The failure of water users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the following penalties:
(1)
Non-payment within ten days from due date will be subject to a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent account.
(2)
Non-payment by the next billing will result in the water service being disconnected from the user's property.
(3)
Non-payment for 60 days from the original due date will allow the city, in addition to all the other rights and remedies, to terminate service, and, in such event, the water user shall not be entitled to receive, nor the city obligated to supply, any water under this agreement.
(b)
Water service shall not be reconnected until the customer's delinquent account, including penalty and disconnect charges, have been paid in full. Should such customer thereafter desire to be reconnected to the water system, such customer shall be required to furnish a security deposit for water reconnection. Bills shall be paid at the city hall and failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from becoming delinquent, nor relieve the customer from payment of the same.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(16), 9-11-2018)
Sec. 30-78. - Complaints and adjustments.
If the customer believes his bill to be in error, he shall present his claim, in person, to the utility clerk at city hall before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill is delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The customer may pay such bill under protest, and said payment shall not prejudice his claim.
(1)
The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of the customer for a fee to be determined by the city council from time to time.
(2)
Water meters will be tested at the request of the customer upon payment of the actual costs of making the test; provided, however, that, if the meter is found to over register beyond three percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made for such test.
(3)
If the seal of a meter is broken by anyone other than a city representative, or if the meter fails to register correctly, or is stopped for any cause, the customer shall pay an amount from the record of his previous bills and/or from other proper data.
(4)
These guidelines are for cases where the customer's water consumption is excessive, resulting from a leak in the customer's line:
a.
The customer is responsible for maintaining all of the water lines from the point of exit from the water meter, except as cited in section 30-75.
b.
Customers may receive not more than one adjustment within a one-year period.
c.
The city will notify the customer immediately following the reading of a period which reflects a usage increase of 100 percent.
(Ord. No. 2018-04, § 1(19), 9-11-2018)
