ARTICLE 5. - A-R AGRICULTURAL-RESIDENTIAL

Section 501. - Purpose.
A-R zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet areas where the primary activities are those of farming, agriculture, livestock, timber cultivation, and related uses consistent with maintaining the land resources of the [sic] Upson County reserved for these purposes. Residences of a low-density nature which are incidental to these activities are also permitted. These districts are free from other uses which are incompatible with a low-density agricultural-residential neighborhood.
Section 502. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an A-R district.
The factors contained in section 410 of this ordinance must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the board of commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Upson County.
Section 503. - Boundaries of A-R districts.
The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all A-R districts within Upson County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
Section 504. - Permitted uses.
