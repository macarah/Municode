(e)
Prima facie case. Whenever litter is thrown, deposited, dropped, or dumped from any motor vehicle, boat, airplane, wagon, wheelbarrow, or other conveyance in violation of this chapter or the rules and regulations promulgated by the director hereunder, it shall be prima facie evidence that the operator of the conveyance has violated this chapter.

Specific penalties cumulative.

The municipal court judge may direct the convicted person to pick up and remove from any public beach, public park, private right-of-way, or, with the prior permission of the legal owner or tenant in lawful possession of such property, any private property upon which it can be established by competent evidence that the person has deposited litter, any and all litter deposited thereon by anyone prior to the date of the execution of the sentence; or
(3)
The court may publish the names of persons convicted of violating this chapter.
(i)
Action in emergencies. Nothing contained in the foregoing subsections or elsewhere in this chapter shall require intermediate measures where the violation is of such nature or degree as to constitute an immediate, clear and present danger to the health and safety of the public.
