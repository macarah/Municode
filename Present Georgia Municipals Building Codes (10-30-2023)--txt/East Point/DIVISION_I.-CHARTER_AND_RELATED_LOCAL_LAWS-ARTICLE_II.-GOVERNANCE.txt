Sec. 2-201. - Regular and special meetings.
(a)
Regular meetings of the city council shall be held at such time and place within the city as the city council shall fix by ordinance. Special meetings of the city council may be held on the call of the mayor and two councilmembers or on the call of three councilmembers. Notice of such special meetings shall be served on all other members personally, or by telephone personally, at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a councilmember in writing before or after such a meeting, and attendance shall also constitute a waiver of notice of any business transacted in such councilmember's presence, unless such councilmember attends for the express purpose of objecting to the legality of the notice provided for the meeting and refuses to participate based upon such objection. In the event of an objection regarding the legality of the notice for the special meeting, the city attorney shall make the determination as to whether notice was properly given. Only the business stated in the call may be transacted at the special meeting.
(b)
The mayor, as presiding officer of the city council, shall have the authority to cancel a meeting of the city council on the grounds of an emergency. Notice of such cancellation shall be served on all councilmembers personally, or by telephone personally, as soon as practical after the emergency event. The mayor shall state the nature of the emergency and reschedule the city council meeting within a reasonable time, not to exceed ten days. Such notice to members shall not be required as to any member who is present when the emergency becomes apparent. Notice to the public shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible in accordance with Code Section 50-14-1 of the O.C.G.A. or such other applicable laws as are or may hereafter be enacted.
Sec. 2-202. - Investigations and inquiries.
Following the adoption of an authorizing resolution, the city council may make investigations and inquiries into the affairs of the city and the conduct of any department, office, or agency thereof and, for this purpose, may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony, and require the production of evidence. Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued by the city council in the exercise of these powers shall be punished as provided by ordinance. The initiation and conduct of any investigations or inquiries by the city council under this charter provision shall not be deemed to constitute interference by the city council with the administration of the government by the city manager.
Sec. 2-203. - Emergencies.
(a)
To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the city council may convene on call of the mayor or two councilmembers and promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance may not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three councilmembers shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances.
(b)
Such meetings shall be open to the public to the extent required by law, and notice to the public of emergency meetings shall be made as fully as is reasonably possible in accordance with Code Section 50-14-1 of the O.C.G.A. or such other applicable laws as are or may hereafter be enacted.

The mayor or any councilmember may, at any time, question the city attorney as to procedural matters governing the meetings of council. The mayor may designate a police officer of the city to serve as sergeant at arms for the express purpose of maintaining the decorum or order at meetings of city council; however, it will remain within the sole discretion of the presiding officer to rule a councilmember out of order.
Sec. 2-205. - Decorum.
It is the intent of this charter provision to encourage decorum, civility, and respect in city council debate. Towards that end, councilmembers shall aspire to the following standards of decorum:
(1)
In legislative debate, councilmembers shall, to the maximum extent possible, keep their remarks germane to the matter before the city council at that time; and
(2)
Councilmembers shall refrain from attacking the motives and character of other councilmembers participating in the debate.
It is not the intent of this provision to, in any way, hinder or impair the full and free expression of competing viewpoints in city council debate. Instead, it is the intent of this provision to foster citizen confidence in government through encouraging civil, respectful meetings.
Sec. 2-206. - Quorum; voting.
Five councilmembers and the mayor or six councilmembers shall constitute a quorum and shall be authorized to transact business of the city council. Voting on the adoption of ordinances shall be by voice vote and the vote shall be recorded in the journal or by voting machine and recorded thereby, but any member of the city council shall have the right to request a roll-call vote, and such vote shall be recorded in the journal. Except as otherwise provided in this charter, the affirmative vote of five councilmembers shall be required for the adoption of any ordinance, resolution, or motion.

(d)
The enacting clause shall be "Be it ordained by the city council of East Point…".

Any ordinance which repeals or amends an existing ordinance or part of the city code shall set forth the ordinance sections or subsections to be repealed or amended.
(f)
An ordinance may be introduced by any councilmember at any regular meeting of the city council or at any special meeting at which an ordinance may be lawfully considered and adopted.
(g)
Each ordinance shall be read by title at two different regular meetings of the city council unless such reading be waived by affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds (2/3) of the council members present at any meeting of the city council duly convened at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that any zoning ordinance, assessing ordinance, or any other ordinance requiring a public hearing shall not be finally adopted until after such ordinance has been properly advertised and a public hearing held thereon.

CHAPTER 4. - RELATIONSHIP AMONG MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL, AND CITY MANAGER.

Sec. 2-401. - Role delineation.
Based upon the firm belief that the proper, efficient, and effective administration and operation of the city's council-manager form of government will be fostered by a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the city council, mayor, and city manager, this charter provision states the following principles, which are intended to be fully consistent with this article:
(1)
The full and complete legislative and policy making authority of the city resides in the city council, and the city manager shall take no action which impinges upon or interferes with the city council's policy making role. Other than providing information relevant and germane to the city council's legislative deliberations, the city manager shall strive to remain a neutral party in such legislative deliberations. To ensure the actuality and appearance of neutrality, neither the city manager nor any department heads shall participate in any political activity on behalf of the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices, nor shall the city manager or any department head make any political contribution to the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices. The mayor and councilmembers shall not solicit or accept any campaign contributions from any city employee;
(2)
The city manager is the chief executive officer of the city, and, as such, all department heads, except the city attorney and city clerk who are appointed by and report to the city council, report to the city manager.

(A)
The mayor and councilmembers shall not in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of any city administrative officers or employees whom the city manager or any of his or her subordinates are empowered to appoint;
(B)
Except for the purpose of conducting an investigation or inquiry authorized by the city council pursuant to Section 2-202 of this charter, the mayor and councilmembers shall deal with city officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the city manager solely through the city manager, and neither the mayor nor any councilmembers shall give orders to any such officers or employees either publicly or privately;
(C)
The mayor and city council shall not give directives to any city officers or employees, other than the city manager, city attorney, and city clerk, regarding any matters including, but not limited to, constituent complaints and complaints regarding the services, operation, or administration of any department or function of city government. Although the mayor and city council shall not be prohibited from communicating with city officers or employees with constituent complaints or concerns, the city manager shall be copied on all such communications;
(D)
The mayor and councilmembers, unless acting pursuant to a duly authorized investigation or inquiry, shall not discuss in open session the performance of or complaints against any city officer or employee during a city council meeting. This provision is not intended to prevent the mayor or city council from discussing, in general terms, the performance of or any issue relating to any department or function of city government; and
(E)
It shall be prohibited for the mayor or any councilmember to sit in on personnel and management meetings between the city manager and city employees unless such participation is consented to by the city manager and approved by the city council; and
(3)
The mayor shall have no management authority or responsibility with respect to the operations and administration of city government; and
(4)
The mayor and city council, as elected officials, shall possess fundamental oversight duties and responsibilities with respect to all operations and administration of city government, and the city manager shall be responsible and duty bound to facilitate the mayor and city council's oversight function. Once the city council has passed the operating and capital budgets of the city, it shall be the responsibility of the city manager to administer such budgets and to keep the mayor and city council fully informed as to the city's progress against such budgets. The city manager shall provide monthly financial updates on the budgets with year to date information, and such updates shall contain all material information necessary for the mayor and city council to evaluate the financial performance and condition of the city. However, once the city council has appropriated funds in the budget and encumbered such funds through subsequent legislative action, the city manager shall have the authority to administer such budget including contract administration and account payables as part of the management function.
