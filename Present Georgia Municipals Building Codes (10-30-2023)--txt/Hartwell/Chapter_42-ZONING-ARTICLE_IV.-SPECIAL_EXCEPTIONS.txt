ARTICLE IV. - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS

Sec. 42-79. - Defined; purpose.
Special exceptions and uses are those which would not normally be appropriate in a zoning district unless strictly controlled as to the size, lot coverage, impact on public services, visibility, traffic and other such related characteristics that are determined by the city council. A procedure is established in this article to integrate the special exception uses with other land uses located in the zoning district. These special exceptions shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the procedure set forth in this article.

Adequate water supply, sewage disposal, storm drainage, and fire and police protection are, or can be, provided for the use.

The use will not have an adverse impact on the physical, visual or spatial characteristics of the overall plan for the tract to be developed.
