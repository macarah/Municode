ARTICLE V. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING

Sec. 42-118. - Spaces—Required.
(a)
Off-street automobile parking and loading spaces shall be provided, as specified in this article, for uses and structures hereafter established in all districts at the time of initial construction of any principal building, unless otherwise exempted from this article. For developments phased in timing, parking and loading requirements may also be phased in accordance with the requirements applying to each particular time phase of development.
(b)
Any building or use that is subsequently enlarged or converted to another use shall meet the off-street parking and loading space requirements of this article for the enlarged or new use.
(c)
Required parking and loading spaces shall be maintained and shall not be encroached upon by refuse containers, signs or other structures, unless an equal number of spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with these regulations.
(d)
Required parking and loading spaces shall be provided with vehicular access to a public street or alley.
(e)
Off-street parking and loading facilities required shall be located contiguous to the principal building or use. However, as much as 25 percent of the required number of parking spaces may be located within 200 feet of the principal building or use, provided proof of ownership of such premises is provided to the zoning administrator. Such distance shall be measured between the nearest point of the parking facility and the nearest point of the principal building or use. If this option of nearby parking is utilized, the parking area may not be discontinued or otherwise converted to another use unless the parking area continues to meet the minimum required number of off-street parking spaces.

The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for each type of permitted use shall be as indicated below.
