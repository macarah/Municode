ARTICLE XVI. - M-2—HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 42-441. - Purpose; intent.
The M-2—Heavy Industrial District is established with the purpose of reserving certain areas with relatively level topography, adequate water and sewerage facilities and access to arterial streets for industrial operations, which are objectionable by reason of the emission of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, gas, fumes, odors or radiation and that do create fire or explosion hazards or other objectionable conditions. Uses within this district may require substantial quantities of water for manufacturing operations and may require rail, air and water transportation. Conditional uses permitted in this district are primarily those known to create a severe safety hazard or to be major producers of air pollution, thus being subject to state and or federal environmental controls. This district is not suitable adjacent to residential districts.
