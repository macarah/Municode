The city is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom the city requested the report;
(2)
The city establishes a continuing relation with the consumer; and
(3)
The city regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides information to the consumer-reporting agency from which it received the notice of address discrepancy.
(b)
Such information shall be provided to the consumer-reporting agency as part of the information regularly provided by the city to such agency for the reporting period in which the city establishes a relationship with the customer.
