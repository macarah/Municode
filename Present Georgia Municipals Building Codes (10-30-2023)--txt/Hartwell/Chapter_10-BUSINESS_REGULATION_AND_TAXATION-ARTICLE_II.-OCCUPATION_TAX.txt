A refusal to submit a notarized affidavit or other written information stating whether a person engages in the practice of law at a particular location or stating the dates of operation at a location shall not be a violation of this article and shall not prevent an attorney from practicing law in the city. The city clerk shall document this refusal for use in any later proceeding. Where an attorney fails or refuses to provide information as to the location where he may be served with notices or citations issued in support of the enforcement of this article, the city shall direct the notices or citations to the address listed with the State Bar of Georgia and shall consider the failure or refusal of the attorney to provide current address information to be consent to this method of service.

An attorney who prepares and signs a notarized affidavit that they did not practice law within the city's jurisdiction during some part of the tax year for which the tax bill was generated may have their bill adjusted for the time period stated in the affidavit when such attorney did not maintain an office within the city's jurisdiction and/or states such other reasons why the occupation tax should be adjusted. Such adjustment shall not be made for those attorneys who elect to pay the $100.00 per practitioner fee as set forth in section 10-35 unless the affidavit states that the attorney did not practice law in the city's jurisdiction at any time during the year for which the tax bill was generated. The city clerk is authorized to inquire whether such affidavit matches the information maintained by the State Bar of Georgia in connection with the directives of State Bar Rule 1-207 and/or to take such other steps as deemed necessary to determine the accuracy of the affidavit. The submission of an affidavit requesting adjustment shall not act to prevent the imposition of penalties and interest should the city clerk deny the request for adjustment.

The city clerk's option to send bills shall not relieve attorneys from the obligation to pay any tax due for any calendar year including 2008 by April 1 of the following year.
(d)
The city clerk may include in any bills the unpaid tax balance from other years, including all fees and penalties and the amount of interest, which has accrued on any unpaid tax liability. The city clerk's failure to list any unpaid balance on any bill shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for any balance due.
