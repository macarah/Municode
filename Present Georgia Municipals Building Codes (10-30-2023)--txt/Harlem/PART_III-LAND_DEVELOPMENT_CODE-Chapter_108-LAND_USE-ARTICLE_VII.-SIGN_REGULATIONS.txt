ARTICLE VII. - SIGN REGULATIONS

Sec. 108-239. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings.
(1)
The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of their idea or identification of their premises.
(2)
Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs throughout the city is necessary to protect the public safety, to ensure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citizens of the city.
(3)
The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type of signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings or facilities, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a proprietary purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefitting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
(4)
The city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
(5)
In considering the appropriate level of sign regulation for the city, the city council has considered planning studies, reports, news articles and related information from a variety of sources. The city finds that advances in technology utilizing LED components results in signs brighter in appearance for LED signs than for signs not utilizing LED technology. While exact measurements have not been determined, some of the explanation for the additional brightness by LED signs is that the field of light projection is diametrically opposed to that of standard signs. Standard sign lighting, whether ground-mounted or platform-mounted, is directed at the sign itself, leaving very little light emission elsewhere; whereas, the LED sign faces the road system providing a brighter, more readable sign. Studies, particularly during non-daylight hours, demonstrate that attention given by drivers to such signs is longer than attention given to non-LED signs. These findings have been reported by such diverse agencies as the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in its March 22, 2007, report on Driving Performance and Digital Billboards and the Wisconsin Dept. of Transportation in its December 1994 Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study. As a result of these and other studies pertaining to sign research and information, a compilation of 16 studies and reports, the city has determined that use of LED technology on signage in the city results in potential driver distractions and competing traffic interferences.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to permit signs that will not endanger public safety, confuse, mislead, or obstruct vision, or otherwise adversely impact the public health, safety, morality or welfare of the community; to regulate signs to protect and enhance the significant scenic, natural and visual assets of the community and its gateways and corridors; to create orderly and uncluttered zoning districts and corridors; and to otherwise support and complement the objectives in this article.

(1)
The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard or renders it dilapidated, unsightly, or unkempt; or
(2)
The sign has been damaged to such extent that more than minor repairs or a material change is required to restore the sign, provided that such damage was not the result of an act of God or by other circumstances beyond the control of the owner of the sign.
(b)
A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards, or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted provided that said replacement does not constitute a material change to the sign. All nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good repair.
(c)
Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted; provided however, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of a nonconforming sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the standards of this article. To the extent that any sign allowable hereunder is damaged or destroyed by an act of God or by other circumstances beyond the control of the owner of the sign then such sign may be repaired without regard to the restrictions of this division within 60 days of when the initial damage occurred; provided that the repairs shall adhere to the original design and shall not prolong the natural life of the sign as it existed before being damaged by an act of God or other circumstances beyond the control of the owner of the sign.

(2)
No person shall maintain or permit to be maintained on any premises owned or controlled by that person any sign which is in a dangerous or defective condition.
(b)
Inspections. The community development director shall periodically inspect each permanent and temporary conforming and nonconforming sign in an attempt to ascertain whether the same is secure or insecure, and whether it is in compliance with the requirements of this article or in need of repair. Responsibility for the safety of signs and security of their attachment or erection remains at all times with the sign owner.
(c)
Removal procedure.
(1)
The community development director shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as an abandoned, dangerous or materially, electrically or structurally defective sign or a sign for which no permit has been issued or which is otherwise in violation of this article. The community development director shall prepare a written notice which shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved and which shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within 30 days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(2)
All removal notices shall be sent by certified mail and first class mail. Any time periods provided in this subsection shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail, or if the first class mail is not returned, three days after mailing.
(3)
The removal notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign and the occupant of the property. If any of such persons is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last-known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises.
(4)
Any person having an interest in the sign, or the property may appeal the determination of the of the community development director ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten days after receipt of notice. The appeal of the community development director determination shall be heard by the city council at their next regularly scheduled meeting that is at least six days after the notice of appeal is received. The appellant may consent to a continued date of hearing, provided the hearing shall be held no later than 45 days from the date of appeal. A final written decision on an appeal shall be rendered by the city council no more than 30 days from the date such appeal was heard. The decision shall be served on the applicant in the same manner as the original determination notice. If a decision is not rendered by the city council within the 30-day period, then the community development director determination shall be deemed to be upheld. If the applicant or permittee is dissatisfied with the decision of the city council, then such person may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court as provided by law.
(5)
Notwithstanding the above, in cases of emergency, the community development director may cause the immediate removal of a dangerous or defective sign without notice. Additionally, signs in the public right-of-way or on public property may be removed without notice at any time.
(6)
Any sign removed by the community development director pursuant to the provisions of this article shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal.
(7)
When it is determined by the community development director that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be made with a sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served. In this emergency situation, the community development director or his designee shall document the imminent danger and attempt to contact the sign owner, and may correct the danger, all costs being charged to the sign owner and property owner.
(8)
If it shall be necessary for the community development director to remove a sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, he may sell the same at private or public sale at the best price obtainable, and shall keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Where the proceeds derived from such a sale are less than the cost of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes.
