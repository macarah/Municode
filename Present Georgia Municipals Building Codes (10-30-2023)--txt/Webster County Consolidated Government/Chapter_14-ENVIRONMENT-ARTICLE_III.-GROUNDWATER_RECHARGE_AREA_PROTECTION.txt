ARTICLE III. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 14-120. - Findings of fact.
(a)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water.
(b)
Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized.
(Code 2003, § 22-261; Ord. of 2-6-2001(1), § 1.2)
Sec. 14-121. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are to:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use, or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Code 2003, § 22-262; Ord. of 2-6-2001(1), § 1.3)
Sec. 14-122. - Definitions.
modified
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.
