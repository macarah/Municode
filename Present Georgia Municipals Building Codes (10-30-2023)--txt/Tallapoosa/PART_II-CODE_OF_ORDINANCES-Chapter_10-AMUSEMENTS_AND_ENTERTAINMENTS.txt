DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 10-19. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition because several court decisions have held that to do so would unlawfully cause to vanish what the courts have declared to be a constitutionally protected form of expression. As to adult erotic dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

Sec. 10-129. - Authorized.
(a)
It is found and declared that there is the existence or occupancy of dwellings or other buildings or structures which are not in compliance with the applicable state minimum standard codes as adopted by ordinance or operation of law or any optional building, fire, life safety, or other codes relative to the safe use of real property and real property improvements adopted by ordinance in the city or general nuisance law and which constitute a hazard to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the city; and that a public necessity exists for the closing of such dwellings, buildings, or structures. It is found and declared that where there is in existence a condition or use of real estate which renders adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation, such use is dangerous and injurious to the health, safety, and welfare of the city and a public necessity exists for the cessation of such use which renders the adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation. Whenever the licensing officer or his designee finds that there exist in the city dwellings, buildings, or structures where conditions exist rendering such dwellings, buildings, or structures unsafe or unsanitary, or dangerous or detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of the residents of the city, power is conferred upon the city to exercise its police power to close the aforesaid dwellings, buildings, or structures in the manner provided in this Code and under O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.
(b)
All the provisions of this Code and O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17, including method and procedure, may be applied to private property where there exists an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions to those persons residing or working in the vicinity. A finding by the licensing officer or his designee, health officer, or building inspector that such property is a health or safety hazard shall constitute prima facie evidence that such property is in violation of this Code and O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.

Sec. 10-131. - General procedure.
(a)
It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property which is located within the city to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force in the city, and such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances.
(b)
The licensing officer is hereby appointed to exercise the powers prescribed by this division and applicable ordinances.
(c)
Whenever a request is filed with the licensing officer or his designee by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the licensing officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property.
(d)
If the licensing officer investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the licensing officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause a summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference, identify the owner and parties in interest, state with particularity the factual basis for the action, and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before the municipal court as pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days and not more than 45 days after the filing of the complaint in the proper court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing.
(e)
After such notice and hearing, if the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order to abate the nuisance.
(f)
If the owner fails to comply with an order and abate the nuisance the licensing officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be vacated and closed or demolished. The licensing officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(g)
If the licensing officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The licensing officer and city council and city employees are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-2-9.

Sec. 10-132. - Lien for cost of demolition.
(a)
The amount of the cost of demolition under this division, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. The lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g).
(b)
The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes, to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the licensing officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(c)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering the lien authorized by this division unless such costs are waived by resolution of the city council. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(d)
The city council may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(e)
Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
(f)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
