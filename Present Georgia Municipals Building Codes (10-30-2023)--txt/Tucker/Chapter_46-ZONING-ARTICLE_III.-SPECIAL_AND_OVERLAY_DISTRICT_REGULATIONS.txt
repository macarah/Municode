DIVISION 2. - DOWNTOWN TUCKER ZONING DISTRICTS

Sec. 46-981. - Downtown zoning districts established.
(a)
The following "Downtown Tucker Zoning Districts" are established:
(1)
DT-1 (Downtown Neighborhood)
(2)
DT-2 (Downtown Corridor)
(3)
DT-3 (Downtown Village)
(b)
References in this zoning ordinance to "Downtown Tucker Zoning Districts or "DT" districts are references to these districts.
(Ord. No. O2019-04-15, exh. A(3.2.1), 6-26-2019)
Sec. 46-982. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
General. The intents of all DT districts are:
(1)
To promote the development of a more dynamic, mixed-use district of appropriate scale and magnitude in downtown Tucker;
(2)
To ensure that new structures and developments are consistent with the vision and recommendations of the downtown Tucker LCI plan with significant community involvement and input;
(3)
To provide a variety of housing types and promote mixed-income residential opportunities;
(4)
To design and arrange structures, buildings, streets, and open spaces to create an inviting, walkable, human-scale environment;
(5)
To provide for connectivity of streets and communities and reduce the dependence on automobile use by increasing the ease of movement and opportunities for alternative modes of travel;
(6)
To ensure a compatible relationship between building placement, building mass and scale, and street by using techniques such as:
a.
Use of additional facade detail; proportion of facade elements, doorways, projections and insets; window design; and creation of strong shadow lines as decorative elements;
b.
Use of consistent setbacks from property lines;
c.
Development of quality sidewalks and a more active, interesting pedestrian environment;
d.
Use of landscaping, lighting, and street furniture to unify district buildings and define space;
e.
Use of compatible materials to promote a design and aesthetic compatible with the desired character; and
(7)
To implement the policies and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and other official policies and plans within the DT districts.
(b)
DT-1 (Downtown Neighborhood). The intent of the DT-1 district is to preserve the existing residential neighborhood character and uses while allowing compatible mixed-use and commercial uses. This neighborhood character is guided by residential architecture such as pitched roofs, smaller scale, fenestration, cornices, columns, etc.
(c)
DT-2 (Downtown Corridor). The intent of the DT-2 district is to encourage mixed-use development along Lawrenceville Highway that creates an aesthetically pleasing and pedestrian-friendly environment. Commercial, residential, and mixed-use developments are desired. Although a mixture of uses is allowed, multi-family and townhouses are preferred. The orientation of any development must be toward Lawrenceville Highway and Lavista Road but access may be from the rear.
(d)
DT-3 (Downtown Village). The intent of the DT-3 district is to revitalize Main Street and create a well-defined core area for Tucker. Mixed-use development with commercial and office uses is encouraged to create the downtown, "Main Street" atmosphere. Additionally, the intent of the district is to incorporate the varying institutional uses such as places of worship, schools, squares and plazas, and government uses into the character of the district. The urban character of this district is guided by shallow or no setbacks, compatible architectural themes, and building materials and massing.

Sec. 46-1032. - Purpose and intent.
modified
(a)
The intents of all NL districts are:
(1)
To encourage development and redevelopment of properties in order to achieve a mixed-use community;
(2)
To provide for the development of sidewalks and walkways in order to promote safe and convenient pedestrian access and to reduce dependence on automobile travel;
(3)
To promote a physically attractive, environmentally safe and economically sound mixed-use community;
(4)
To permit and to encourage mixed-use developments containing commercial and residential uses in order to create a pedestrian-oriented community where people can live, work, and play;
(5)
To improve the visual appearance and increase property values;
(6)
To implement the policies and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and other official policies and plans within the NL districts;
(7)
To enhance the long-term economic viability of the Northlake area by encouraging new commercial and residential developments that increase the tax base and provide jobs to the citizens of the City of Tucker;
(8)
To establish and maintain a balanced relationship between industrial, commercial, and residential development to ensure a stable and healthy tax base;
(9)
To provide a balanced distribution of regional and community-focused commercial and mixed-use office centers;
(10)
To support higher-density housing, office, and mixed-use centers which have appropriate access and infrastructure;
(11)
To create regulations that meet the goals and objectives of the Atlanta Regional Commission's Livable Centers Initiatives program;
(12)
To allow design flexibility in order to encourage innovative development projects that set high standards for landscaping, green space, urban design, and public amenities;
(13)
To encourage an efficient land use and development plan by forming a live-work-play environment that offers employees and residents the opportunity to fulfill their daily activities with minimal use of single-occupant automobiles;
(14)
To allow and encourage development densities and land use intensities that are capable of making productive use of alternative transportation modes such as transit, ridesharing, bicycling, and walking;
(15)
To encourage the formation of a well-designed, pedestrian-friendly activity center with high-density commercial and residential development that increases vitality and choices in living environments for the citizens of the City of Tucker;
(16)
To protect nearby established single-family residential areas from the encroachment of commercial, retail, office, and industrial uses by providing for increased density of development within the NL districts;
(17)
To protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Tucker; and
(18)
To promote uniform and visually aesthetic architectural features which serve to unify the distinctive visual quality of the Northlake area.
(b)
NL-1 (Northlake High-Intensity Commercial). The intent of the NL-1 district is to allow for the most intense mixed-use development in Tucker. It encourages the redevelopment of parking lots into a mix of retail, office, and residential uses in the same development.
(c)
NL-2 (Northlake Office Park). The intent of the NL-2 district is to reflect established office, retail, and multifamily areas. It allows residents to live close to employment and to provides accessibility to shopping areas.
(d)
NL-3 (Northlake Employment Center). The intent of the NL-3 district is to recognize and protect the existing employment base. It encourages light manufacturing, distribution, showroom and small supporting retail uses.

The intent of the NL-4 district is to provide low to medium density residential development opportunities and a mix of housing types. This district also serves as a type of transitional zoning along with the perimeter of the Northlake Zoning Districts. Along Vista Dale Court, this district preserves the existing scale and character of the street by encouraging compatible new development and provides a transition between the more intense development to the west and neighborhoods to the east.
