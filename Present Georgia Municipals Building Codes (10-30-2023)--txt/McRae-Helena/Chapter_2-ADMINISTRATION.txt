Sec. 2-65. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Benefit means anything, whether or not the same has monetary value, perceived or intended by either the offeror or the recipient to be sufficient in value to either influence a public official in the performance or non-performance of a public duty or to induce the recipient to so influence some other public official.
Board means the board of ethics for the city.
City means the City of McRae-Helena, or, as is reasonably inferred, its agents, officers, or employees.
Council member includes all city council members.
Employee means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the city or one of its departments.
Government means the city, or, as is reasonably inferred, its departments, agents, officers, or employees.
Immediate family means a spouse, child, parent, or sibling of an elected official, appointed official, agent, or employee of the city.
Incidental interest means an interest in a person, entity or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value.
Interest means any direct or indirect financial gain accruing to an elected or appointed official, agent or employee of the city, or to immediate family of the same, which is the result of a contract or transaction that is, or may be, the subject of an official act of action by, or with, the city.

For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public.

Ten percent of the recipient's gross income during that period, whichever is less;
(3)
The person serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors or other governing board of a for-profit entity other than a corporate entity owned or created by the city council; or
