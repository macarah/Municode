Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground, a manufactured home, and/or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: the market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 16-40. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 1, § B, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-41. - Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands;
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 1, § C, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-42. - Objectives.
The objectives of this article are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;

(10)
Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 4, § A, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-55. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
(1)
New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-54(4).
(2)
Heating and air conditioning equipment elevation. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
(3)
Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 16-53(7).
(4)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
1.
Individual lots or parcels;
2.
In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
3.
In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or
2.
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
c.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
d.
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
1.
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
2.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions.);
3.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (4)(a) through (c) of this section.
Floodway located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-24 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(i)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted; however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof;
(ii)
Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 16-54 through 16-60.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 4, § B, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-56. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-44, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-44, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of sections 16-54 through 16-60. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply.
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided, demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of section 16-54(4).
(4)
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 4, § C, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-57. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (AE zones) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways.
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-44, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 16-55.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 4, § D, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-58. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones).
Areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-44, may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-54(4). The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structures may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level, plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in sections 16-52(b)(1) and 16-54(4).
(3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 4, § E, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-59. - Standards for subdivisions.
(a)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
(c)
All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(d)
For subdivisions and/or developments greater than lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 4, § F, 6-7-2011)
Sec. 16-60. - Standards for critical facilities.
(a)
Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain.
(b)
All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.
(Ord. No. 0168, art. 4, § G, 6-7-2011)

ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES

Sec. 16-89. - Committee, council to hear appeals; conditions for granting a variance.
(a)
The city planning committee shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. Said decision may be further appealed to the city council.
(b)
The limited basis for any appeal shall be error in any requirement, decision, or determination as made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision on appeal may further appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally-dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the planning committee or council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
(h)
Conditions for variances. A variance shall be issued only when there is:
(1)
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
(2)
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
(3)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(i)
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(j)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(k)
The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(l)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the administrator, the planning committee or the council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
