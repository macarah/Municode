(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prohibit the excessive, loud, unusual or explosive use of engine and compressed air-braking devices within designated areas in the city.
(b)
Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following words and phrases are defined as follows:
Compression brake or engine brake means any device which, by the release of compressed air within an engine cylinder prior to the ignition of fuel therein, results in the slowing of said vehicle and/or braking without the use of wheel brakes. Such devices are commonly referred to as "Jacobs brakes," "Jake brakes," or "exhaust brake."
(c)
Prohibitions. It shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to use or operate or cause to be used or operated within designated areas in the city, any engine brake, compression brake or mechanical exhaust device designed to aid in the braking or deceleration of any vehicle that results in excessive, loud, unusual or explosive noise from such vehicle, unless such use is necessary to avoid imminent danger. Such prohibition shall be applicable only to those public highways or portions specifically identified in this section. Observation, upon the braking of a vehicle, of a sudden loud, engine-centered braking noise, uncharacteristic of wheel brakes, shall be prima facie evidence that a brake prohibited by this section was utilized by the driver of the vehicle.
(d)
Areas of prohibition. The prohibition set forth herein shall apply to the following public highways in the city:
