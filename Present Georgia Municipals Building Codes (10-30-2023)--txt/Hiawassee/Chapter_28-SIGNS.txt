Sec. 28-1. - Purpose and findings.
It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.
The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting the ordinance from which this chapter derives, the mayor and council intend to:
(a)
Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(b)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
(c)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(d)
Maintain the historical image of the city;
(e)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(f)
Promote economic development; and
(g)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
Be it ordained by the mayor and city council of Hiawassee that:
