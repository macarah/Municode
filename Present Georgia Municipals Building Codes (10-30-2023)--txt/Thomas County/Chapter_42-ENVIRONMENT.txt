(Amd. of 4-1-04)
Sec. 42-30. - Abatement authorized.
The chief building official or his designee is hereby designated as the public officer to enforce this article and is authorized to abate any nuisance existing in the county, whether or not such nuisance is specifically recognized by this article. Whenever any nuisance exists within the unincorporated area of the county or upon any property of the county, or whenever any condition shall exist on any property in the unincorporated areas of Thomas County that is required or subject to be demolished, removed or abated under any of the ordinances of the county and the owner or person responsible for the nuisance refuses or fails after due notice to demolish, remove or abate the nuisance, the public officer shall issue a summons and cause it to be served upon such owner and all parties in interest (O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12), stating the condition complained of and the ordinances or parts of ordinances claimed to be violated, and requiring such person to appear before the magistrate's court at a time, date and place stated in the summons, to show cause why such condition should not be demolished, abated or removed.
(Amd. of 4-1-04)
Sec. 42-31. - Service of process.
Service of summons shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12.

Sec. 42-32. - Order for abatement.
If the magistrate at the hearing determines that a condition does exist as alleged that constitutes a nuisance or a condition that under the ordinances of the county is required or subject to be demolished, removed or abated, the magistrate shall issue his order and judgment so finding, and shall order the property owner or other responsible person to demolish, remove or abate such condition within a period of time to be fixed by the magistrate. This order shall further provide how the condition is to be abated. This order shall further provide that if the property owner or responsible person shall fail to comply with the order within the time specified, the county, its officers and employees, shall be authorized to proceed without further notice to demolish, remove or abate such condition and to take whatever action is deemed necessary to demolish, remove or abate such condition; and the expense shall be charged against the owner of the property or responsible party in question and shall be a lien against the property upon which the condition existed, ranking equally with the lien for county taxes. Execution shall issue as in the case of county taxes, and the procedure for the enforcement of such execution shall thereafter be the same as in the case of county taxes. Where the address of the person to be served is known, or where there is a last known address, a copy of the notice shall also be mailed to such person at that address by certified mail return receipt requested.
(Amd. of 4-1-04)
Sec. 42-33. - Nuisances constituting imminent danger.
Whenever any condition shall exist that constitutes an immediate and grave hazard to public health and safety requiring immediate action, such condition may be abated or otherwise remedied summarily and without following the procedures set forth in this article.
(Amd. of 4-1-04)

General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection 42-74(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections 42-74(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as ten a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;

Editor's note— Ord. of 6-9-09(3), §§ 1—8, amending §§ 42-96—42-103 shows an adoption date of June 21, 1999, however documentation from the county confirms change of adoption date to June 9, 2009.

Sec. 42-96. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within Thomas County, Georgia, are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a Wetlands Protection Ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Thomas County, Georgia. The purposes of this ordinance are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. The objective of this article is to make the public aware of state and federal laws that protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife.
(Ord. of 6-21-99, § 1; Ord. of 6-9-09(3), § 1)
Sec. 42-97. - Definitions.
Functions. The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities.
Generalized wetland map. A map depicting jurisdictional wetlands within Thomas County.
Hydric soils. Soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the Soil Conservation Service.
Hydrophytic vegetation. Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional wetland. A wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Regulated activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Silviculture. The art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees.
Wetland. An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
Wetland delineation. The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps.
Wetland protection district. All wetlands within the jurisdiction of Thomas County, Georgia which are indicated on the generalized wetland map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation".
(Ord. of 6-21-99, § 2; Ord. of 6-9-09(3), § 2)
Sec. 42-98. - Wetland protection district established.
(a)
Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of Thomas County, Georgia. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the Thomas County Building Department.
(b)
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 Permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of Thomas County, Georgia, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 6-21-99, § 3; Ord. of 6-9-09(3), § 3)
Sec. 42-99. - Local development registration.
(a)
Local development registration requirements. No regulated activity will be conducted within the wetland protection district without registration with the Thomas County Board of Commissioners or its designee. All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) below or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local registration. If the area proposed for development is located within 25 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or letter of permission.
(b)
Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, drainage, or dredging except as provided herein.

Secs. 42-135—42-155. - Reserved.
ARTICLE VI. - PROTECTED RIVER CORRIDORS

Sec. 42-156. - Purpose.
River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
The Ochlocknee River, Little Ochlocknee River, and the Aucilla River has been designated as protected rivers by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Ochlocknee River, Little Ochlocknee River, and the Aucilla River as defined herein.
(Ord. of 6-9-09(4), § I)
Sec. 42-157. - Definitions.
(a)
Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.)
(b)
Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use.
(c)
Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "the Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
(d)
Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
(e)
Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400-cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents.
(f)
Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.
(g)
River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow.
(h)
River corridor means all the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 150 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks.
The 150-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 150-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection boundaries.
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the Thomas County Comprehensive Plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs.
(i)
Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:
(1)
Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
(2)
Rare or exemplary natural communities;
(3)
Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or
(4)
Other areas so designated by the Department of Natural Resources; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.
(j)
Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family.
(Ord. of 6-9-09(4), § II)
Sec. 42-158. - Establishment of the Ochlocknee River, Little Ochlocknee River and the Aucilla River Corridor Protection Boundaries.

Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river although this strip of land is not included as part of the 150-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Ochlocknee River, Little Ochlocknee River, and the Aucilla River Corridor Protection District Map. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference.
