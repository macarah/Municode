DIVISION 13. - CONSTRUCTION BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT AND APPEALS

Sec. 18-451. - Board established.
There has been previously established a board to be called the construction board of adjustment and appeal, which shall continue its existence under this chapter. Said board consists of five members and two alternates, appointed by the commissioner.
(1)
Board members. Such board members shall be composed of individuals with knowledge and experience in the standard building codes, such as design professionals, contractors or building industry representatives. In addition to the regular members, there shall be two alternate members, one member at large from the building industry and one member at large from the public. A board member shall not act in a case in which he has a personal or financial interest.
(2)
Terms. Members of the board shall be appointed for a term of three years; provided that, the term of the initial members may be for less than three years so that the terms of members shall be staggered. The two alternates, if appointed, shall also serve three-year terms. Vacancies shall be filled for an unexpired term in the same manner in which original appointments are made. Continued absence of any member from three consecutive meetings of the board shall, at the discretion of the commissioner, render such member subject to immediate removal from office. Members are eligible for reappointment.
(3)
Voting. A simple majority of the board shall constitute a quorum. In varying any provision of this chapter, the affirmative votes of the majority present shall be required. In modifying a decision of the building official, not less than two affirmative votes shall be required. In the event that regular members are unable to attend a meeting, an alternate member shall serve and shall have the right to vote.
(4)
Secretary. The chief building inspector shall act as secretary of the board and shall make a detailed record of all its proceedings, which shall set forth the reasons for its decision, the vote of each member, the absence of a member and any failure of a member to vote.
(5)
By-laws. The board shall establish rules and regulations for its own procedures not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. The board shall meet on call of the chairman. The board shall meet within 30 calendar days after notice of appeal has been received.

Sec. 18-452. - Appeals and variances.
The construction board of adjustments and appeals shall have the power to hear the appeals of decisions and interpretations of the building official and consider variances of the standard building codes more specifically as listed in the following sections.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-453. - Appeals.
The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his contractor, may appeal a decision of the building official to the construction board of adjustment and appeals whenever any one of the following conditions are claimed to exist:
(1)
The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system;
(2)
The provisions of the applicable code do not apply to this specific case;
(3)
That an equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case; or
(4)
The true intent and meaning of the codes or any of the regulations thereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-454. - Time for filing appeals.
Notice of appeal of any decision of the building official shall be in writing and filed within 30 calendar days after the building official renders his decision. Appeals shall be in a form provided by the building official.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-455. - Variances.
The construction board of adjustments and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provisions of the codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this chapter or standard building codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following:
(1)
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service systems involved and which are not applicable to others;
(2)
That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant;
(3)
That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other building, structure or service systems;
(4)
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service systems; and
(5)
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-456. - Time limits, conditions.
In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-457. - Finality.
The decision of the board shall be final, subject only to review by writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Bartow County.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-458. - Limitations on variances; improper variance requests.
Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the building official, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Generally, variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, unless otherwise specified. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied.
