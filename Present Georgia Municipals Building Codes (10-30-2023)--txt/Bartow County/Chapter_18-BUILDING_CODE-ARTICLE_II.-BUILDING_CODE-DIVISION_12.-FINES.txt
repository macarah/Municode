However, repeated citations for the same violation on a second and subsequent days shall not count as a subsequent violation, but shall rather be assessed at the same rate as the initial violation.

First violation. For the first violation of any provision of this chapter by any violator (whether an individual or corporation), the fine shall be $200.00.
(2)
