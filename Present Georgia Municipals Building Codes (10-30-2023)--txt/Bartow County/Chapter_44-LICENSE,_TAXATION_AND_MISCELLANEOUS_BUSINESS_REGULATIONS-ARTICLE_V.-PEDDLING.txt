ARTICLE V. - PEDDLING

Sec. 44-351. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating peddling, itinerant traders, traveling salesmen, and other door-to-door salesmen, generally known as peddlers. Such persons typically market magazines, appliances, house wares, and other goods and services by going door to door in neighborhoods and business districts. The citizens of Bartow County are subject to unregulated peddling by sometimes questionable organizations or individuals, with illegitimate products, or no intent to deliver. It is the purpose of this article to regulate peddling in the county, to protect the public health, safety and welfare. To achieve this end, this article requires peddlers seek licenses, have background checks, and peddle under certain limitations. However, it is not the intent of this article to require legitimate sales representatives, visiting business or persons they have already made appointments with, or already have a legitimate business relationship with, to need licensing. Neither is it the intent of this article to infringe free speech rights or require licensing for persons going door-to-door for political campaigns, religious proselytizing, or other free speech reasons.
