The owner of all houses, buildings or property used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, situated within the county and abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is not located nor may in the future be located a public sanitary or combined sewer of the county, is hereby required at his expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provision of this article, within 90 days after the date of official notice to do so, provided that there is a public sewer within 300 feet of the property line.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 7)
Sec. 74-272. - Private sewage disposal.
(a)
Definitions. As used in this section, private facility means a sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to property owned only by a single owner. Examples would include a facility serving a single industrial site, or a facility serving a mobile home park where all lots are owned by a single owner. Public facility means a sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to more than one property owned by different owners. Examples would include a facility serving an industrial park with several owners, or a facility serving a subdivision with separate homeowners.
(b)
Private facilities. Privately-owned private facilities are permitted, subject to approval by the water superintendent. All proposed private facilities that require permitting under the Federal Clean Water Act shall require approval by Bartow County prior to submission of permit application.
(c)
Public facilities. Public facilities that are privately owned are not permitted. Sewage treatment facilities that serve more than one property owner shall be allowed only as publicly-owned and operated systems. Furthermore, any permits for such facilities shall be issued to Bartow County as the appropriate government agency.
(d)
Before commencement of construction of a privately-owned private facility, the owner shall first obtain a written permit from the state department of human resources, division of public health.
(e)
The type, capacities, location and layout of private facilities shall comply with all recommendation of the department of human resources.
(f)
The owner shall operate and maintain the private facilities in a sanitary manner, as determined by the state and county health officers at no expense to the county.
(g)
No statement contained in this article shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by state and county health officers.
(h)
The owner of a failed private facility or private sewer system must connect to the public sewer within 60 days of failure and must abandon the private system, insurance no improper disposal or leakage of waste.
(i)
No septic tanks will be allowed in the county (1) unless at the time of the application there is no existing public sewer within 300 feet of subject property available from either a city or the county, or (2) prior approval is given by the county water superintendent due to other exigent circumstances with respect to the particular piece of property to be served. "Exigent circumstances" is defined as something arising suddenly or out of current events; any event or occasional combination of circumstances calling for immediate action or remedy; or a pressing necessity.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 8)
Sec. 74-273. - Building sewers and connections.
(a)
No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the superintendent.
(b)
There shall be two separate classes of building sewer permits for residential and commercial service and for service to establishments producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the county. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent. A permit and inspection fee in the amount established by ordinance for a residential or commercial building sewer permit and a negotiated fee based upon use for industrial wastes shall be paid to the county at the time the application is filed.
(c)
All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner, who shall indemnify the county from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
(d)
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building provided the buildings are sole ownership.
(e)
Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the superintendent, to meet all requirements of this article.
(f)
The size, slope, alignment, materials and construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing pipe jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the county. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the A.S.T.M. and Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
(g)
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
(h)
No person shall connect roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
(i)
The connection of the building sewer into public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules or regulations of the county, or in amplifications of the A.S.T.M. and W.P.C.P. Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the superintendent before installation.
(j)
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the building inspection department when the building owner is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection to the public sewer shall be made under the supervision of the building inspector or his representative.
(k)
Each premises, business or household must pay the prevailing sewer tap fee based on the current rate ordinance.
(l)
When an existing building is subdivided for new tenants, sewer fees must be paid for each individual unit. Utilization of the existing internal sewer lines are permitted for the subdivided building, provided building is a sole ownership.
(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 9)
Sec. 74-274. - Tampering with sewage works unlawful.
