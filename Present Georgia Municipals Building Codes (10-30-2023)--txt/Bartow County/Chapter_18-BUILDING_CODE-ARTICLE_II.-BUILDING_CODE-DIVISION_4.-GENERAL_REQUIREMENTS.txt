Such fee shall cover the initial inspection and one follow-up inspection. The applicant shall be charged a fee for each additional follow up inspection that may be necessary. A $250.00 penalty will be added to permits where the mobile home was brought on the lot before an installation permit was obtained.
(5)
Certificate of completion. A certificate of completion shall be issued to the applicant at such time that the building official certifies that the requirements of this division have been met. In the event the manufactured home, once installed, cannot meet the requirements of this division, it either must be repaired to comply with the standards herein or removed.
(6)
Removal of home in violation of this section.

Sec. 18-123. - Reserved.
Editor's note— Section 18-123 was deleted as being superseded by provisions in an ordinance adopted on June 4, 2008, § II, which amended § 18-122. Former § 18-123 pertained to underpinning and derived from an ordinance adopted Jan. 3, 2007.
Sec. 18-124. - Installation of industrialized homes.
Construction of industrialized homes is regulated by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs and not this article. However, installation of homes must meet manufacturer's specifications and the specifications of the zoning ordinance before permanent utilities may be installed. An installation permit must be obtained prior to installation and an inspection must occur of the installation, including utility connections and foundation, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
(1)

Due to the unique design and engineering of signs, the inspection only includes those parameters involved with the footing and electrical metering of the signs. It is the contractor's sole responsibility to assure that the sign is constructed to the engineered drawing specifications. It is the owner's responsibility to make sure the sign is kept in a safe state of repair.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-127. - Moved houses.
A house moved to another location in Bartow County (or a house moved into Bartow County from another county) must have the necessary improvements made so as to be in compliance with the standard building codes that are in effect for new construction at the time the home is placed in its new location. Where any particular improvements that would be required to the moved house are technically unfeasible or impractical, or would be cost prohibitive (especially in relation to the benefit received or the purpose, goal, or intent of the standard or regulation at issue), a written request may be made to the building official requesting an exemption from the particular standard or requirement, and detailing why the request for exemption is being submitted. The building official may grant exemption, if reasonable, or may deny the exemption. Any denial may be appealed to the construction board of adjustment and appeals pursuant to division 13. The exemption granted should not impair the public safety purposes of the standard building codes and should be the minimum necessary.
(Ord. of 1-3-2007(1))
Sec. 18-128. - Prohibited exterior materials; temporary repair exception.
It shall be unlawful to use roof or wall covering material that has not been approved by the applicable building code as exterior covering material except in the event a building is damaged by natural or manmade disaster, or suffers a roof leak, other leak, or other damage. In such cases, temporary materials may be applied to a building to provide a temporary repair for no more than 60 days from the date of the damage. One 60-day extension can be requested from the building official, for cause, if the structure is not able to be properly repaired with approved exterior covering material within 60 days. Examples of materials that are not approved as exterior covering materials include, but are not limited to, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, and OSB. This restriction shall not apply to [a] building that would not require a building permit to construct, such as outbuildings and storage buildings.
(Ord. of 9-1-2010, § III; Ord. of 2-9-2011, § II)
Sec. 18-129. - Partially-built structures.
The county finds that partially-built and subsequently abandoned homes and other building and structures are occurring more frequently and are an aesthetic harm to the community; they also reduce property values of adjacent and nearby property; they create a public safety hazard in that they can be dangerous; and they invite illicit activity. The county finds such structures to be a nuisance. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for a property owner to leave a residential, commercial or industrial structure in a partially-built status for more than six months with no substantial progress occurring on the construction. Partially-built means foundations that are poured or erected; basements that have been dug and partially completed; and structures that have been framed or dried-in (siding, roofing, windows and doors in place) but not completed. For homes that have been damaged by fire or disaster after completion, see section 10.1 of appendix A, the zoning ordinance. It shall be permissible to finish the exterior of a commercial shopping center or other commercial or industrial building without building-out the inside. It shall also be a violation for a partially completed building or structure to remain unfinished without a certificate of occupancy more than 30 days after the expiration of its building permit (building permits expire one year from issuance unless extended; see section 18-168). The building official shall be authorized to issue citations to the property owner or builder, and shall be authorized to seek abatement of the nuisance in magistrate court or superior court.
(Ord. of 9-1-2010, § IV)
Sec. 18-130. - Commercial car washes.
Effective January 1, 2011, any commercial conveyor car wash (as defined herein) that is permitted and constructed, shall install a recycled water system which captures and reuses water previously used in wash or rinse cycles. A minimum of 50 percent of the water utilized shall be recycled. A "commercial conveyor car wash" is a commercial car wash where the car moves on a conveyor belt during the wash (regardless of whether the driver remains in the vehicle or not). These restrictions shall not apply to self-service car wash bays or in-bay car washes where the car remains stationary and the wash equipment moves around the vehicle.
(Ord. of 12-8-2010, § I)
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Dec. 8, 2010, supplied provisions to be added to this Code as § 18-128. In order to maintain the numbering system of this Code, at the discretion of the editor, these provisions have been resdesignated as § 18-130 to read as set out herein.
Sec. 18-131. - Retaining walls.
(a)
Permit required. A building permit shall be required for any retaining wall that exceeds three feet in exposed wall height, or exceeds two feet in exposed wall height and supports a surcharge. A building permit application shall require a site plan showing the location, extent, and height of the retaining wall in relations to any building structure, pool, property lines, and public utility easements. It shall also require complete construction details of the retaining wall, and structural calculations for the wall, both stamped and signed by a professional engineer.
(b)
Definitions.
Retaining wall: A wall designed to resist lateral earth and/or fluid pressures, including any surcharge, in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
Surcharge: A vertical load imposed on the retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of the retained soil. Examples of surcharges include sloping retained soil, structure footings supported by the retained soil, adjacent vehicle loads supported by the retained soil, and solid fences that are attached or directly adjacent to a retaining wall when wind pressures act on the fence.
Exposed wall height: The vertical distance measure from the finish grade at the bottom of the wall (lower soil grade) to the finish grade at the top of the wall (upper soil grade). This height does not include the wall and depth of footing below grade.
(c)
Tiered retaining walls. Use of tiered walls is a special condition where two or more short walls, horizontally offset from one another, are used in lieu of a single tall retaining wall. When tiered walls are not properly offset from each other, the upper wall may impose a surcharge condition on the lower wall. In order for the walls to be treated as separate retaining walls, a general rule of thumb is that the tiered walls be horizontally offset by a minimum distance of two times the exposed wall height of the lower wall. For example, two tiered retaining walls, each with an exposed wall height of three feet and level backfill, which are horizontally offset by a distance of two feet, would be treated as a single six-foot-tall wall. As a result, a building permit would be required.
(Ord. of 7-13-2011, § III)
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted July 13, 2011, § III, supplied provisions to be added to this Code as § 18-130. In order to maintain the numbering system of this Code, at the discretion of the editor, these provisions have been redesignated as § 18-131 to read as set out herein.
Sec. 18-132. - Commercial car washes.
Effective January 1, 2011, any commercial conveyor car wash (as defined herein) that is permitted and constructed, shall install a recycled water system which captures and reuses water previously used in wash or rinse cycles. A minimum of 50 percent of the water utilized shall be recycled. A "commercial conveyor car wash" is a commercial car wash where the car moves on a conveyor belt during the wash (regardless of whether the driver remains in the vehicle or not). These restrictions shall not apply to self-service car wash bays or in-bay car washes where the car remains stationary and the wash equipment moves around the vehicle.
