A statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such a schedule may not extend the time for compliance beyond that required by applicable federal, state or local law.
(2)
Wastewater discharge permits may contain, but need not be limited to, the following conditions:
a.
Limits on the average and/or maximum rate of discharge, time of discharge, and/or requirements for flow regulation and equalization;

(Ord. of 12-17-2003(2), § 30)
Sec. 74-348. - Same—Appeals and modifications.
(a)
The superintendent shall provide public notice of the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person, including the user, may petition the superintendent to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within 30 days' notice of its issuance.
(1)
Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
(2)
In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit.
(3)
The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal.
(4)
If the superintendent fails to act within 15 days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
(b)
The superintendent may modify a wastewater discharge permit for good cause including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
(1)
To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements;
(2)
To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes or wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit issuance;
(3)
A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
(4)
Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the county's POTW, county personnel or the receiving water;
