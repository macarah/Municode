Sec. 34-251. - Title.
This article shall be known as the "Bartow County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation and Pollution Control Ordinance."
( Ord. of 12-7-2016 )
Sec. 34-252. - Authorization.
This article is adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, and to the power delegated to the county by the Constitution of the state and general law.
( Ord. of 12-7-2016 )
Sec. 34-253. - Statement of purpose.
Soil erosion and sediment deposition onto lands and into waters within the watersheds of this county are continuing to occur as a result of widespread failure to apply proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities. Such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of county waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resource uses. Improperly controlled soil erosion and sedimentation are a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this county and the intent of this article to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities and programs of this county and the state, and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive soil erosion and sediment control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air, and other resources of this county.

DIVISION 2. - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EROSION, SEDIMENTATION AND POLLUTION CONTROL USING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

Sec. 34-267. - Best management practices; minimum requirements.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures shall conform to the minimum requirements of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with the requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPs.
(1)
Best management practices (BMPs), as set forth in this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, shall be required for all land-disturbing activities undertaken in the county. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia", specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b), which is incorporated herein by reference.
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and/or maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the county or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the county or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements that [than] stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion.
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical practicable erosion potential.
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented.
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to the erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum.
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. Exposed areas shall be vegetated or otherwise stabilized within seven days after disturbance. Temporary vegetation cannot be used as permanent vegetation.
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable.
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1.
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills.
(11)
Cuts and fills that deposit sediment on adjoining property are prohibited; cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property.
(12)
Cuts and fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners.
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum.
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section.
(15)
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-5, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream, cause of width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications, and are implemented: i) stream crossings for water lines; ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines;.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.
(f)
Additional requirements.
(1)
Allowing visible amounts of sediment to flow onto an adjoining property, into the waters of the state, or across any downstream property, shall constitute a violation of this article.
(2)
In addition to BMPs, all land-disturbing activities subject to this article shall be conducted in compliance with the county site and utility details for development, if applicable.
(3)
Stabilization of all areas of erodible earth material shall occur weekly and shall not be exposed seven calendar days.
(4)
Utility companies which are utilizing roadway shoulders for construction are required to maintain and/or stabilize the earth shoulders to within 300 feet of construction. Shoulder construction shall be stabilized every three days as a maximum period time. They are also required to stabilize the shoulder before leaving the work area on any particular day if rain is forecast within the next 24 hours.
(5)
Tree protection fencing and two rows of Georgia DOT Type "C" wired back silt fence shall be installed at all locations where construction activity will be adjacent to a state water requiring a buffer.
(6)

Such action may be taken by the commissioner of the county, upon recommendation of the county engineer.
(b)
Revocation, suspension, or modification of permit; other penalties. If any person commences any activity requiring a development permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said development permit, or if any person is found in violation of this article, or for any other reason given in subsection 34-283(e) of this article, the person shall be subject to revocation, suspension or modification of his development permit, in addition to other penalties provided herein. Such actions may be taken by the county engineer, who shall provide written notice to the permit holder. All actions of revocation, suspension or modification of permits, business licenses, work permits and other authorization pursuant to this section may be appealed pursuant to section 34-299 of this article.
(c)
Withholding of certificates of occupancy.
(1)
The county may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site where any violation of this article exists, until such time as the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures as set forth in the notice to comply or has otherwise cured the violation.
(2)
When a particular applicant, property owner, or operator is in violation of any provision of this article on any site in the county, the county may withhold certificates of occupancy on all other sites where that applicant, property owner, or operator is seeking a certificate of occupancy, until all violations by said person are corrected.
(3)
No certificates of occupancy shall be issued on any project or property where violations of this article are ongoing. This shall prevent issuance of a certificate of occupancy to an individual builder when the general subdivision development land disturbance permit is being violated. However, violations by other builders in that subdivision shall not prevent builders in compliance from receiving certificates of occupancy.
(4)
No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final stabilization measures are in place, unless measures cannot be emplaced because of extenuating circumstances (i.e. extreme drought). In such instances a variance should be sought under section 34-298. In no event shall temporary vegetation be counted as permanent vegetation. Prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy, a plan shall be filed detailing the remaining final stabilization measures to be installed, and the timetable for installation (which in no event shall be longer than six months). Failure to finish installation and complete final stabilization by this timetable shall be a violation of this article for the builder/developer, and for the property owner. In the event of a variance granted to complete final stabilization after a certificate of occupancy is issued or other transfer of ownership occurs, or in the event final stabilization is not complete at such time for any reason, the builder/developer shall retain responsibility for compliance and final stabilization, in addition to the new owner of the property.
(d)
Fines. Fines assessed under this article shall be assessed according to the following mandatory schedule, whether assessed as a civil administrative fine, or assessed as a criminal penalty upon conviction. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-15, notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violations. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.
(1)
Maximum fines. Any person violating any provisions of this article, any permitting conditions, or any stop-work order shall be liable for a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation, which may be assessed as a civil administrative fine or criminal penalty. In no event shall a fine be reduced below the mandatory minimum, as set in subsection (2) below.
(2)
Mandatory minimum fines. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the following penalties are mandatory and shall be assessed for any land-disturbing activity performed in violation of any provision of this article or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article:
a.
For any violation involving land-disturbing activities under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $1,000.00 per day for each violation.
b.
For any violation of a stop-work order issued under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $2,000.00 per day for each violation.
(3)
Repeat violator fines. As a deterrent to violation, third and subsequent violations by the same offender of any provision of this article, whether violations of the same or different provisions of this article as the initial violation, and whether involving the same or different property, shall increase the fine owing. However, repeated citations for the same violation on a second and subsequent days shall not count as a subsequent violation, but shall rather be assessed at the same rate as the initial violation. Multiple violations on the same day shall also be assessed at the same level. This same schedule shall apply to criminal penalties and civil administrative fines.
a.
For the third or subsequent violation by any person involving land-disturbing activities under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $2,000.00 per day for each violation.
b.
For the third or subsequent violation by any person of a stop-work order issued under this article, the minimum required fine shall be $2,500.00 per day for each violation.
(e)
Additional criminal penalties. Persons cited criminally are also subject to the following criminal penalties:
(1)
Incarceration. In addition to monetary penalties, any person cited with a criminal violation, and found guilty in magistrate court, may be punished by a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days in jail in addition to the minimum fine.
(2)
Community service. In lieu of, or in addition to, any fine or incarceration, community service may be ordered by the magistrate court as punishment for a violation of this article. Said community service shall be not less than 20 hours but not more than 250 hours, which must be performed within a period set by the magistrate court, not to exceed one year from the date of conviction for a violation of this article.
(3)
Any person placed on community service or otherwise placed on probation for a violation of this article shall pay such supervisory fees as may be authorized by law.

Sec. 34-298. - Variances.
(a)
Process. Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be heard initially by the county engineer. Variances defined as available only from the EPD director cannot be granted by the county engineer. Any variance given by the director may also be required an additional variance approval by the county engineer, considering the criteria in this section, prior to implementation. See the county stream buffer protection ordinance.
(b)
Criteria. In reviewing application for variances, the county engineer shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. A variance shall only be granted upon (i) a determination that the variance is the result of topography or other hardship beyond the applicant's control, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased erosion, stormwater run-off, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances; (iv) a determination that the variance will not have a negative impact based on the criteria in subsection (c) below; and (v) a determination the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief. A variance to allow permanent vegetation to be installed after issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall have a duration of no longer than six months.
(c)
Specific negative impact factors. The specific negative impact factors to be considered are as follows:
(1)
The possibility that, given the variance, erosion, sedimentation or stormwater run-off will affect or injure the lands of others;
(2)
The danger to life and property due to erosion damage;
(3)
The availability of alternative options, reconfigurations, and other measures that would achieve erosion and sedimentation control without a variance;
(4)
The potential for increased maintenance costs subsequent to completion of the development;
(5)
The negative impacts that the proposed variance would create;
(6)
The purposes of the requirement and this article.
(d)
Conditions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this article, the county engineer may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as he deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.
(e)
Appeals. Appeals of denial or grant of a variance may proceed according to section 34-299 of this article.
