Sec. 7.16. - Conservation subdivision (special district).
modified
7.16.1 Purpose. It is the purpose and intent of Bartow County in enacting these regulations to provide for increased greenspace in Bartow County, and to preserve open land in perpetuity for future generations, while not increasing the overall development levels for the County. The purpose is further to increase the aesthetic beauty of the County, improve the value of adjacent property, and generally serve to enhance the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Bartow County.
7.16.2 Procedure. A conservation subdivision allows increased residential density in conjunction with the fee simple grant of undeveloped and undisturbed greenspace to the County or to such land trust as the County may designate. The applicant seeking to develop a conservation subdivision must meet with the Zoning Administrator and provide a survey of the entire tract, prior to placement of lots and roads. The County and the applicant shall then agree upon the tract to be donated. Where possible, the tract to be donated should link up with other greenspace tracts or trails. A minimum of one-half of the total acreage of the parcel must be donated to qualify for a conservation subdivision. Alternative greenspace arrangements are also available. See Section 7.16.9.
7.16.3 Applicable districts. A conservation subdivision is permissible in the following zoning districts: R-1, R-2, R-4, RE-1, and RE-2.
7.16.4 Development regulations. In a conservation subdivision, the following development standards shall apply.
(A)
Minimum lot size is reduced by 50% from the existing minimum residential lot size under that zoning classification, if sewer is available. For example, in authorized "R" districts, minimum lot size reduces to 7,500 square feet. In "RE" districts, minimum lot size becomes 1.5 acres. If sewer is not to be used for waste disposal, the minimum lot size shall be 50% of the existing minimum, or the amount required by the health department, whichever is greater.
(B)
The overall density of lots shall not exceed that number which would be permissible under the normal development standards; gross density shall not be increased, except as provided in subparagraph (C) below.
(C)
Curb and gutter shall not be required in conservation subdivisions in RE-1 and RE-2 districts.

Hunting shall not be permitted in greenspace areas and any deed of conveyance of greenspace to the County or land trust shall contain a deed restriction to that effect.
7.16.6 Standards. Approval of a conservation subdivision shall be granted or denied by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall consider the following factors:
(A)
Whether the applicant has designated and offered to dedicate appropriate amounts and locations of greenspace.
(B)
Whether the conservation subdivision would be detrimental to the surrounding uses.
(C)
Whether the terrain or location of the property is not suitable for a conservation subdivision, or is not desirable as greenspace.
(D)
Whether the area remaining after dedication of greenspace is suitable for development at the proposed density.
7.16.7 Approval, post-approval procedure. The Zoning Administrator shall issue written approval or denial of the conservation subdivision. Upon approval of the conservation subdivision, the applicant shall cause a survey and legal description to be prepared of the greenspace. Greenspace shall be clearly identified on all preliminary plans and all development plans. Greenspace shall be dedicated to a land trust as the developer may designate, the County, or to the Home Owners' Association prior to approval of the final plat, by fee simple deed, to be preserved in perpetuity as greenspace. Appeal of the approval of a conservation subdivision must be initiated within thirty (30) days of written approval by the Zoning Administrator of the conservation subdivision. If an appeal is initiated, the applicant may withhold dedication until the appeal is completed.
7.16.8 Appeal. Appeal of the Zoning Administrator's decision to approve or deny a conservation subdivision can be taken by the applicant or any aggrieved citizen by filing a notice of appeal within thirty days with the Zoning Administrator, who shall forward the appeal directly to the Board of Appeals. The Board of Appeals shall hear the appeal at the next available hearing. Appeals from the Board of Appeals shall be to the Commissioner pursuant to Article XIV.
7.16.9 Alternative greenspace. In a conservation subdivision, the applicant may propose alternatives from the standard requirement. The applicant may propose purchasing an equivalent amount of greenspace adjacent and contiguous to existing county greenspace elsewhere in the County; the applicant may propose donating an equivalent amount of greenspace to an approved land trust; or the applicant may propose submitting funds to purchase an equivalent amount of greenspace, to be paid into a County greenspace bank for future purchase of greenspace at the County's discretion. Such dollar amounts would be based on appraisals approved by the Zoning Administrator, at pre-development values. Payment or contribution of land shall occur prior to approval of the final plat. Any alternative greenspace arrangement must be approved by the Commissioner. Alternative greenspace arrangements require the voluntary cooperation of the applicant; otherwise, the standard requirement shall apply.

This Ordinance further honors the agreement made with the Nations by Bartow County. Property in the Etowah Valley Historic District is subject to additional procedures prior to rezoning or development, in order to achieve these purposes.
7.17.2 District established. The Etowah Valley Historic District is an overlay district, the boundaries of which are depicted on the map described in Section 7.17.3. All provisions of the underlying zoning district shall continue to apply in addition to the requirements of this Section. In cases of conflict, the stricter requirement shall control.

Sec. 7.18. - Business park district.
7.18.1 Purpose. The purpose of the Business Park District is to provide uniform regulations for a joint City of Cartersville-Bartow County industrial/business park, a portion of which is located in each jurisdiction.

The Business Park District, where applied via amendment to the Official Zoning Maps of the participating government, shall control over inconsistent regulations contained in other ordinances and the Code of Ordinances of each jurisdiction, whether or not the provisions herein are stronger or weaker restrictions. The purpose of this district is also to provide consistent development standards for other industrial and business parks located in the vicinity of the joint City-County park, so that the area is developed consistently and without incompatible uses or negative impacts on infrastructure, public health, safety or welfare. This District may also in the future be applied to other areas of the County. The provisions of this section control over inconsistent provisions in other sections of this Ordinance or other portions of the Code of Bartow County.

Buffers shall be undisturbed, except that, if the buffer is adjacent to a residential use, and is insufficiently dense to be opaque to vision year round, the Zoning Administrator may require that the buffer shall be planted with sufficient vegetation so that it is opaque year-round, to a depth of at least twenty-five feet. Buffers may be used for perpendicular crossing by access roads and utilities, but not for lateral roads or parking. Buffers may be used for detention ponds, provided that vegetative screening remains or is planted between the pond and the property line. The County or City Zoning Administrator dependent on jurisdiction shall approve buffer plans and plantings.
