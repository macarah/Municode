(b)
Surety terms and conditions. The bond or letter of credit required by this section shall protect the county against any damage requiring re-ditching or repair of existing ditch structures or the removal of any harvesting residue, including tree tops, debris, logs, pulpwood and other materials, placed in or around the county's rights of way caused by such person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit. The proceeds of such bond or letter of credit shall be available to reimburse the county for any cost incurred to repair such damages or remove such debris in or around the county's rights of way.

Such claim may be given in person, by telefacsimile, email or mail. The claim shall describe the damage in detail and, in compliance with section 68-6(a), give the person or firm the opportunity to repair such damage within 30 days of the notification; provided, however, the county shall be authorized to repair the damage immediately if the county determines the conditions present a threat to public safety, health or welfare and, upon making such repairs, shall present to the person or firm and the issuer of the applicable bond or letter of credit an itemized list of expenses incurred as a claim against the responsible party and the issuer of its bond or letter of credit. Upon the issuance of a claim as provided in this section, the county shall notify the issuer of the bond or letter of credit that a claim has been made and will be resolved or adjudicated according to the terms of this chapter.

modified
Within 30 days of receipt of the written claim described in section 68-5, the person or firm against whom the claim is submitted may:
(a)
Repair such damage at his or its own expense with the approval and supervision of the county. When repairs are completed to the satisfaction of the county, the county shall provide a written notification of satisfactory completion within five business days to the responsible person or firm and to the surety issuing the bond or the bank issuing the letter of credit, thereby terminating the claim.

In the event of inclement weather or other factors preventing repair of the damage, request a 30-day extension to repair the damage from the county, provided that no extensions shall exceed 90 days from the date the claim was tendered. Approval of any extension shall be at the discretion of the county.
(c)
Appeal the claim or adverse decision of the county to the Magistrate Court of Bartow County. Any such appeal must name the issuer of the bond or letter of credit as a party, who shall be served with all pleadings in the action and shall have the right to appear. The Magistrate Court will hear evidence and arguments within 30 days of the written appeal and issue a ruling within ten days of such hearing. Any such appeal shall toll the 30-day period to repair, or any extension thereof, required by section 68-5. If the Magistrate Court rules in favor of the person or firm against whom the claim was made, the county shall have no right to recover any proceeds of the bond or letter of credit, and judgment shall be entered against the county. If the Magistrate Court rules in favor of the county the court shall determine the amount of damages to which the county is entitled to recover and enter judgment accordingly; the county shall be authorized to call the bond or letter of credit and recover from the proceeds thereof an amount equal to the judgment entered by the court, up to the total amount of the bond or letter of credit. The portion of any judgment entered in favor of the county that exceeds the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be subject to collection by any additional remedies at law or equity.
(d)
In the event the person or firm against whom the claim has been submitted fails to take any of the actions allowed under subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this section within the time required therein, such person or firm shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights to contest the call of the bond or letter of credit.

(b)
In the event a bond or letter of credit tendered pursuant to the requirements of this chapter is revoked by the surety or bank, then a valid replacement bond or letter of credit must be delivered to the county within five business days after the date of revocation in order for timber harvesting operations to continue. In addition, if the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit caused its revocation, the amount of the bond or letter of credit required shall be increased to $7,500.00 after the first revocation, and $10,000.00 after a second revocation caused by the person or firm tendering the bond or letter of credit.

Sec. 68-10. - Standards for operations.
new
Under the authority of Title 32 of the Georgia Code, giving counties the authority to regulate streets including rights of way and drainage thereto, the county imposes the following additional regulations for timbering operations.
(a)
Prevention of contamination.
(1)
Violation to contaminate roads. Contamination of public roads with mud, dirt or debris from timber operations is prohibited. The tracking, spilling, dropping, washing, carrying or dumping of any materials, dirt or mud onto any public road in this county, from any vehicle or equipment exiting a timber harvesting tract, or any vehicle having previously exited a timber harvesting tract, shall be a violation of this chapter. The term "materials" shall include debris from harvested trees, limbs, branches, rock, gravel and other similar material originating at a timber harvesting tract.
(2)
Temporary exit requirements. A temporary exit must be installed and maintained for any timbering operation in the county, at any point of egress from a timber harvesting tract onto a public right-of-way or street. Such exit must be established and maintained prior to any timber hauling vehicles or timbering equipment leaving the site, and shall be maintained until the timber hauling operation is completed, and shall meet or exceed the following specifications:
a.
The exit pad shall be adequate to substantially eliminate the transport of mud from the timber site by either vehicles or equipment or from water runoff.
b.
The exit pad of gravel or stone must at least be 20 feet in width by 50 feet in length with a depth of six inches, with a geo-textile pad underneath. The pad may be required to be an additional width, length and/or depth if, in the opinion of the community development department, conditions so warrant.
c.
At such exit location there shall be established a cleaning station, water pump station or some other such means to rinse or clean the exiting vehicle of sediment and debris prior to its entrance onto the public right-of-way.
(3)
Contamination of rights-of-way. No timber operator shall allow dirt, mud or other debris resulting from timber operations to accumulate upon the right-of-way of any public road to such an extent that it becomes a nuisance or hazard to persons traveling upon such roads, or that it creates an unsightly condition upon the public right-of-way.
(4)
Interference with drainage. No timber operator shall allow dirt, mud or other debris resulting from timber operations to accumulate in ditches and drainage areas on public rights-of-way to such an extent that the usual flow of water or runoff is stopped, disturbed, changed or interrupted.
(5)
Cleanup and reimbursement. Any materials or mud spilled, dropped, washed or tracked from vehicles or equipment leaving the site onto roadways or into public rights-of-way, drainage ditches or storm drains must be removed within 24 hours or the county may perform any necessary corrective work and the timber operator shall reimburse the county for any expenses incurred from the required bond or letter of credit. Any such contamination and spillage, even if cleaned up within 24 hours, constitutes a violation of this chapter.
(6)
Fines. In addition to any cleanup costs that shall be reimbursed to the county, any timber operator failing to comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, or failing to clean up or remove any debris, dirt, mud or other material from any public road, right-of-way or drainage ditch, within 24 hours of the spill or contamination, shall be fined $500.00 upon the first citation, and $1,000.00 upon each subsequent citation.
(b)
Additional requirements.
(1)
Nuisance prohibited. No timber operator shall create any other type of public nuisance.
(2)
Parking. No timber operator or person shall park or leave unattended a truck or other motor vehicle or trailer upon the right-of-way of any county road.
(3)
Soil erosion and sedimentation controls required. No timber operator will commence operation or continue to operate without first installing and maintaining soil erosion and sedimentation controls, in accordance with the best management practices of the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia, sufficient to prevent dirt, mud or other debris from accumulating in bodies of water within the county, the county drainage ditches and on the county roads upon which the timber operator is entering and exiting.
(4)
Signs. No timber operator shall commence timber operations until he has first posted or caused to be posted along the public road onto which the timber operator will enter from his timber operations at least the following signs: one sign in each direction located 500 feet from the entrance which states "Slow Trucks Entering Highway"; and one sign in each direction located 1,000 feet from the entrance stating "Warning: Logging Operation Ahead." Each such sign shall be 36 inches by 36 inches, orange in color and posted at least three feet from the road surface of such road.
(5)
Reimbursement for abatement of nuisance. In addition to any other penalty provided for under the provisions of this chapter, or under the provisions of any state or federal law, any timber operator in violation of this section shall reimburse the county for any costs and expenses incurred in abating such nuisance.
