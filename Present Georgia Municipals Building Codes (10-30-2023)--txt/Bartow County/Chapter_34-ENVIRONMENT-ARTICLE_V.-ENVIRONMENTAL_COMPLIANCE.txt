ARTICLE V. - ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Sec. 34-351. - Purpose and objectives of article.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation and prevention of litter, waste, tire disposal and burning.
(b)
The objectives of this article are as follows:
(1)
To provide for uniform prohibition throughout the county of any and all litter on public or private property;
(2)
To prevent any reduction in the quality of life or aesthetic beauty of the county;
(3)
To prevent environmental harm to the waters of the county;
(4)
To preserve air quality of the county;
(5)
To prevent health risks associated with used tires and scrap tires; and
(6)
To provide a clean and well-kept environment for the citizens of the county.

Litter is a nuisance that decreases property values and contributes to the decline of neighborhoods and property values, and should be eliminated. The open burning of certain material emits numerous toxins into the atmosphere and environment that end up being consumed by animals and humans, to the detriment of the public health and welfare, and must be prohibited.
