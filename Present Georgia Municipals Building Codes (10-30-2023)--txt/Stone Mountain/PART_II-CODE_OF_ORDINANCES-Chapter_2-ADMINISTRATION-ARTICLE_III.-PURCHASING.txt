Sec. 2-51. - Introduction.
(a)
Purchasing is the procurement of supplies, equipment and services at the lowest prices consistent with the quality needed for the effective operations of the departments of the city. This procurement is an important function of the city, and for any purchasing department to be truly effective, there must be full cooperation between all departments. Serving the needs of each department will be the foremost consideration of the purchasing department. However, to obtain the greatest value for every dollar spent it is necessary to follow a set of procedures when purchases are made.
(b)
The procedures outlined are to be used by all city employees in requesting and purchasing equipment and supplies.
(c)
Changes will be issued as new procedures are approved.

(Ord. No. 08-14, 11-4-08)
Sec. 2-55. - Functions of the departments.
(a)
Departments should plan their work so that "rush orders" and emergencies will be held to a minimum. Requests should be forwarded to the purchasing department far enough in advance to allow sufficient time for delivery.
(b)
Departments should assist the purchasing department by suggesting the names of vendors that have access to particular items being requested, especially items of a technical nature. However, the purchasing department is in no way confined to the vendors suggested. The purchasing department maintains a list of vendors and any responsible firm may be added to that list upon application by telephone or mail.
(c)
The city is not obligated to purchase equipment or accessories that are delivered for use on a "trial" basis.
(d)
No department has the authority to order directly from a vendor or negotiate purchases in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00).
(e)
No city employee shall purchase supplies, material or equipment of any kind for personal use.
(f)
Department heads will be called upon to assist in writing specifications for bids. Specifications should not be written which are considered "closed" (written around one (1) specific brand). Brand names, model numbers, etc., may be submitted as a guideline as to the type and quality of merchandise desired. However, the wording "or approved equal" will always be added so as not to discriminate against any vendor's merchandise. Competition must be kept in mind throughout the writing of specifications.
