Normal Retirement Benefit.
(1)
A participant, upon retirement on his normal retirement date, shall receive a monthly retirement benefit under which payments shall commence on the first day of month following his normal retirement date and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during his lifetime. The amount of the monthly retirement benefit for service as a full-time employee of the employer shall be determined as one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) the product of: one and one-half (1½) percent of the participant's final average earnings, multiplied by years of total credited service.

a.
Credited past service shall be as defined in section 2-102; except, however, that any eligible employee who does not elect to become a participant as of the date he is first qualified to do so may elect to become a participant on the first day of any succeeding month; however, the credited past service of such participant shall not include the period of service from the date he was first qualified to become a participant to the date he elects to become a participant, or any creditable past service due him on the date he was first qualified to become a participant under the plan.
b.
Credited future service shall be as defined in section 2-102 and limited to time spent in the service of the employer, except as provided in 2-104(e) and in subsection 2-106(a)(2)g. below.
c.

Total credited service shall not exceed the total calendar years and complete months during which a participant was an eligible employee, except as herein otherwise provided.
d.
Maximum annual earnings to be used for computing final average earnings for benefit accrual shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00).

Full months of credited past and future service shall be treated as fractions of one (1) year. Partial months shall not be included in the calculation.
g.
Accumulated days of unused sick and/or vacation leave for which a terminated participant who is a full-time employee is not paid shall constitute additional credited future service as prescribed herein. At the time of such participant's termination of employment, the pension committee shall certify to GMEBS the total amount of the participant's unused sick and/or vacation leave which qualifies as credited future service pursuant to this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, each twenty (20) days of unused sick and/or vacation leave shall constitute one (1) complete month of credited future service. Partial months shall not be credited. Notwithstanding any other provision in the plan to the contrary, unused sick and/or vacation leave which is counted as additional credited future service under this subparagraph shall not be used to fulfill any age or service requirements for participation, vesting, or retirement eligibility under the plan.
(b)
Early Retirement benefit. A participant, upon retirement on his early retirement date, shall receive a monthly retirement benefit under which payment shall commence on the last day of the month in which the participant's early retirement date occurs and shall be payable on the last day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the participant. The amount of such monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit, but reduced on an actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with the actuarial table contained in section 2-109(a).
(c)
Delayed Retirement Benefit. A participant may retire from the service of the employer on the first day of any month subsequent to his normal retirement date.

(e)
Suspension of Benefits.
(1)
Any retirement benefits payable under this plan to any participant shall be suspended, except as otherwise provided herein, as of the date he is reemployed as an eligible employee, and shall be resumed as of the first day of the month following his subsequent retirement. In any case where the payment of a participant's retirement benefits shall have been so suspended, the retirement benefits payable on his subsequent retirement (whether before or after his normal retirement date) shall be the benefit computed in accordance with this section on the basis of his aggregate total credited service and on the basis of his final average earnings at the time of his subsequent retirement, but reduced on an actuarial basis by the value of any retirement benefits received by him prior to being reemployed as an eligible employee and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at the time of his previous retirement. In no event shall the resulting benefit be less than the benefit payable at the time of his previous retirement. A retired participant who is reemployed as an eligible employee shall not be authorized to change his beneficiary on his subsequent retirement or to name a beneficiary in retirement if one had not been previously named. For the purposes of this subsection, any such participant's total credited service subsequent to his reemployment by the employer shall commence as of the date of his reemployment as an eligible employee.
(2)
Any disability retirement benefit payable under this plan to any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to the provisions of section 2-105(e) shall be suspended as of the date his disability ceases. In any case where the payment of a participant's disability retirement benefit shall have been so suspended, the period of absence from employment due to such disability shall be treated as a leave of absence without pay and the provisions of section 2-104(e) shall apply; except that such period of absence shall not be counted as credited future service. Any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to the provisions of section 2-105(e) and who dies or who has been or shall be subsequently declared ineligible for a disability retirement benefit because of a cessation of the disability shall have a right to any benefit afforded him under any other provision of this plan to which he or his beneficiary might otherwise be entitled. Any disability which ceases or is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the retiree and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under this Plan.
(f)
Cost-of-Living Adjustment.
(1)
The amount of the benefits payable under this plan to a participant or his beneficiary shall be adjusted by the current average cost-of-living index figure as provided herein.
(2)
The current average cost-of-living index figure shall be ascertained as of January 1 in each year.
(3)
Each monthly retirement benefit then being received shall thereupon be adjusted as follows:
a.
Each monthly retirement benefit shall be increased by the percentage the current average cost-of-living index figure increased over each recipient's cost-of-living base figure. If the current average cost-of-living index figure is less than the average cost-of-living index figure determined on January 1, of the previous calendar year, no reduction in the monthly retirement benefit shall be effected. Increased benefits are payable at the end of the month in which the adjustment is made.
b.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no increase in the amount of a monthly retirement benefit due to changes in the current average cost-of-living index figure effective at any annual adjustment date (January 1) shall be in excess of five (5) percent of the amount of the monthly retirement benefit payable immediately prior to each participant's or beneficiary's applicable adjustment date.

(a)
Election of Optional Retirement Benefits. A participant may elect, or may revoke a previous election and make a new election, at any time prior to his actual retirement date, to have his retirement benefit payable under one of the options hereinafter set forth in lieu of the retirement benefit he is otherwise entitled to receive. The benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such option elected. Election of any option shall be made by the participant in writing and shall be subject to approval by GMEBS.
(b)
Description of Options. The amount of any optional retirement benefit set forth below shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the participant under section 2-106.
(1)
Option A, joint and survivor option. A decreased retirement benefit which shall be payable during the lifetime of the participant and, if his beneficiary should survive him, shall continue after his death during the lifetime of his beneficiary in the same amount or in such smaller amount as the participant may designate. If the beneficiary does not survive the participant, all payments shall cease at the death of the participant; and no further benefits will accrue to his estate or to other persons except as provided in section 2-108(b). This option shall be known as option A. The retirement benefit under option A shall be calculated in accordance with section 2-109(b)(1) or (2), whichever is applicable.
(2)
Option B, period certain and life option. A decreased retirement benefit payable monthly to the participant during his lifetime and, in the event of his death within a period of five (5), ten (10), fifteen (15), or twenty (20) years after his retirement, the same monthly amount shall be payable for the balance of such period to a beneficiary designated by him. If the beneficiary does not survive the participant, all payments shall cease at the death of the participant; and no further benefits will accrue to his estate or to other persons except as provided in section 2-1086(b). This option shall be known as option B. The retirement benefit under option B shall be calculated in accordance with section 2-109(c).
(3)
Option C, social security option. An increased retirement benefit, determined as of the participant's early retirement date, payable to him during his lifetime until his retirement benefits commence under the Federal Social Security Act at age sixty-two (62), and a decreased retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have a more level retirement income when such decreased retirement benefit is added to his primary benefits under the federal Social Security Act. At the death of the participant, all payments will cease; and no further benefits will accrue to the estate of the Participant or to other persons except as provided in section 2-106(b). This option shall be known as option C. The actuarial equivalent factors to be applied in calculating benefits under option C shall be those contained in section 2-109(d)(1) or (2), whichever is applicable.
(c)

(d)
Restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, a participant's election of the form of benefit payment will be restricted to assure compliance with the minimum distribution incidental death benefit requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 401(a)(9).
(e)
Rule for Small Annuities. The present value of a retirement fund benefit shall be distributed to the participant or terminated participant or the terminated participant's beneficiary if the benefit does not exceed Internal Revenue Code Section 411(a)(11)(a) limit on the date of termination. The value of a participant's or terminated participant's benefit shall be determined in accordance with section 2-109(g) on the date of the participant's termination.
(Ord. of 11-13-90, Art. VI, §§ 1—5)
Sec. 2-108. - Death or termination of employment.
(a)
Death Prior to Retirement.
(1)
Upon becoming eligible for participation in accordance with section 2-104, a participant may designate one (1) and only one (1) beneficiary on a form provided for that purpose. In so doing, he specifically provides thereby that in the event the participant's employment is terminated by reason of his death prior to his retirement, there shall be paid to his designated beneficiary a monthly death benefit actuarially equivalent to the reserve required for the participant's anticipated normal retirement benefit. In calculating the normal retirement benefit under the provisions of this section, the following assumptions shall be used:
a.
The participant's age at the time of his death is sixty-five (65), or his attained age if his attained age is greater than sixty-five (65); and
b.
The total credited service shall include the amount of credited service accrued prior to the date of the participant's death plus half of the service between such date of death and what would otherwise have been the participant's normal retirement date. In no event shall the amount of total credited service exceed the sum of the actual service performed plus ten (10) calendar years. The death benefit under this section shall be calculated in accordance with section 2-109(e).
(2)
Terminated vested death benefit. If a terminated participant dies prior to retirement, his designated and surviving beneficiary may apply to receive a lifetime monthly terminated vested death benefit, subject to the provisions of this section. The beneficiary for this purpose shall be the beneficiary designated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Said designation may be changed in accordance with paragraph (3) below. If the terminated participant's designated and surviving beneficiary is the terminated participant's spouse as of the date of the terminated participant's death, then the lifetime monthly death benefit payable to the spouse beneficiary prior to retirement ("spouse beneficiary" or "spouse") under this paragraph shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the terminated participant's death. Alternatively, the spouse beneficiary may elect to defer benefit payment commencement until the first day of any month up to and including the date the terminated participant would have attained normal retirement age. If the spouse beneficiary does not apply for payment of monthly death benefits within one (1) year after the terminated participant's death, the spouse beneficiary shall be considered to have deferred benefit payment commencement until the first day of the month following the date the spouse makes such application. If the designated and surviving beneficiary is not the spouse of the terminated participant, then the lifetime monthly death benefit payable to the beneficiary under this paragraph shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the terminated participant's death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "spouse beneficiary prior to retirement," "spouse beneficiary," or "spouse" shall be as defined in section 2-102. Benefits under this paragraph shall be computed as follows:
a.
Terminated participant death before early retirement age; payment before early retirement age. If a terminated participant dies before attaining early retirement age, and if benefit payments commence to a spouse beneficiary prior to retirement or non-spouse beneficiary prior to retirement before the terminated participant would have attained early retirement age, then the monthly death benefit payable to said beneficiary shall be the actuarial equivalent of the monthly retirement benefit amount that would have otherwise been payable to the terminated participant, assuming: (i) the terminated participant survived until normal retirement age; and (ii) the terminated participant retired on the date he reached normal retirement age, and elected the optional form of retirement payment designated herein as option A at one hundred (100) percent, and then died. Said benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the actuarial assumptions specified in section 2-109(f).
b.
Terminated participant death before early retirement age; deferred payment by spouse until after early retirement age. If the terminated participant dies before attaining early retirement age and a spouse beneficiary defers payment until a date which is on or after the date the terminated participant would have attained early retirement age, then the monthly death benefit payable to the spouse beneficiary shall be the monthly retirement benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the terminated participant, assuming that: (i) the terminated participant survived until the date upon which the deferred benefit payments commence in accordance with the spouse beneficiary's selected benefit commencement date; and, (ii) the terminated participant elected on such date to retire with the optional form of retirement payment designated herein as option A at one hundred (100) percent, and then died.
c.
Terminated participant death after early retirement age; payment upon death. If the terminated participant dies after attaining early retirement age, and if benefit payments commence to a spouse beneficiary prior to retirement or a non-spouse beneficiary prior to retirement on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the terminated participant's death, then the monthly death benefit payable to said beneficiary shall be the monthly benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the terminated participant, assuming: (i) the terminated participant retired on the date of death, and (ii) the terminated participant elected the optional form of retirement payment designated herein as option A at one hundred (100) percent, and then died.
d.
Terminated participant death after early retirement age; deferred payment by spouse. If the terminated participant dies after attaining early retirement age, and if a spouse beneficiary defers payment in accordance with this paragraph, then the monthly benefit payable to the spouse beneficiary shall be the monthly retirement benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the terminated participant, assuming that: (i) the terminated participant survived until the date upon which the deferred benefit payments commence in accordance with the spouse beneficiary's selected commencement date, and (ii) the terminated participant elected to retire on such date with the optional form of retirement payment designated herein as option A at one hundred (100) percent, and then died.
Benefits under this paragraph (2) shall be calculated taking into account only the participant's total credited service and final average earnings as of the date of his termination of employment with employer, and the applicable benefit formula in effect on the date of said termination. Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph, if a beneficiary dies before applying for payment of a monthly death benefit hereunder, or if a spouse beneficiary dies before payment of a deferred benefit is due to commence, then no benefits shall be payable under this paragraph.
(3)
The present value of a monthly lifetime death benefit otherwise payable under this section shall be distributed in a lump sum if it does not exceed the dollar limit established under Internal Revenue Code section 411(a)(11)(A) as of the date of distribution. The present value of said benefit shall be determined in accordance with section 2-109(g).
(4)
Designation of a beneficiary may be changed by the participant in writing on a form provided for that purpose at any time prior to actual retirement. Only the last such designation of a beneficiary prior to retirement shall have effect; and any new designation of a beneficiary invalidates, supersedes and revokes any prior designation.
(5)
Any failure by a participant to designate a beneficiary prior to retirement under the provisions of this subsection, or any failure of a designated beneficiary to survive the participant, shall preclude the payment of any benefit authorized herein.
(b)
Death After Retirement. Upon the death of a participant subsequent to his retirement, there shall be payable to the participant's designated beneficiary a benefit to be determined as follows:
(1)
If the participant has not elected an optional form of payment, as provided in section 2-107, or if he has elected an optional form of payment and his designated beneficiary does not survive him, no further payment of any kind whatsoever shall be made at the death of the participant.
(2)
If the participant has elected an optional form of payment, as provided in § 2-107, and his designated beneficiary survives him, benefits shall be payable to the beneficiary as provided by the option elected.
(c)
Termination of Employment Before Retirement.
(1)
A participant whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or retirement shall be entitled to a vested right in his accrued benefit if he has completed a minimum of five (5) years of total credited service in the plan. Payment of such vested retirement benefit shall commence on the first day of the month following his normal or early retirement date at the option of the participant and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the life of the participant. The amount of such monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the manner prescribed for normal or early retirement in section 2-106 but based upon his final average earnings and total credited service up to the participant's date of termination of employment with the employer.
(2)
A participant whose employment is terminated because he is disabled shall be entitled to a vested benefit provided his period of disability begain on or before the participant's date of termination of employment as a result of a disability. No disability benefit shall be payable unless application for such benefit is made within one (1) year after employment is terminated as a result of such disability, except when a delay is caused by a pendency of a disability determination by the Social Security Administration.
(d)
Termination of Employment Before Retirement; Portability.
(1)
A participant whose employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily for any reason other than death, disability or retirement, after participation in the plan, shall have a right to a vested retirement benefit under the conditions set forth below. The amount of the monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the manner prescribed for normal or early retirement in section 2-106, but based on his final average earnings and total credited service up to the participant's date of termination of employment with the employer. Payment of such benefit shall commence, at the option of the participant, on the first day of the month following his normal or early retirement date as prescribed in the plan and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter, provided that:
a.
Any future employer be a GMEBS employer which maintains a GMEBS retirement plan with a provision on portability that is the same or substantially similar to this subsection; and
b.
To be entitled to any benefits under the provisions of this plan, the participant must meet, through his total credited service with all GMEBS employers, the service requirements for vesting as provided for herein;
c.
Each break in employment between GMEBS employers shall not exceed five (5) years.
(2)
In the event the participant's immediately preceding employment was with a GMEBS employer or employers, the service performed for such former employer or employers shall be used for the purpose of qualifying the participant for vesting or retirement under this plan. In no event shall service with another GMEBS employer be used to calculate the benefit amount due the participant from this employer.
(3)
In the event the employer is his final GMEBS employer, the benefit under this subsection shall begin when the participant retires and shall be computed as prescribed in article 2-106.

In the event of disagreement between a participant and the employer with respect to any rights, claims or responsibilities under the plan which cannot be resolved by the pension committee as provided under section 2-111, the participant may make an appeal regarding such rights, claims or responsibilities to the governing authority. In the event that any such rights, claims or responsibilities result in a suit or other legal action by a participant or beneficiary, such action shall be defended in the same manner as other suits against the employer. Any legal action on behalf of the city in regard to the plan shall be first authorized by the governing authority and shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by the governing authority. GMEBS shall have no responsibility to defend or pursue legal action arising under the plan.
(b)
Failure To Act. GMEBS shall not be responsible for the failure of the employer to perform any of their obligations under the plan, including the duty to remit payments to GMEBS, to provide necessary records concerning participants and their earnings to GMEBS, or any other functions required of the employer by the plan, contract, or by the rules and regulations of GMEBS.

Sec. 2-115. - Amendment and termination.
(a)
Amendment of the Plan. The governing authority shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the plan; however, no such amendment shall:
(1)
Reduce the benefits of any participant or beneficiary; or
(2)
Authorize or permit any part of the trust fund held by the board to be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries; or
(3)
Operate to deprive any participant or beneficiary of any rights or benefits irrevocably vested in him under the plan prior to such amendment, except that the governing authority may make any and all changes or modifications necessary to qualify the plan or to keep the plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, or any amendment thereto; or
(4)
Become effective until approved by the board. In order to be approved by the board, any amendment must comply with all applicable state and federal laws. If the board does not approve an amendment, the board shall continue to administer the plan as if such amendment had not been made.
(b)
Amendment of the plan To Transfer Assets; Termination of Trust Agreement.
(1)
The city may amend the plan and contract so as to provide for the transfer of assets to successor trustees and to terminate the existing trust agreement between the city and the board. Any such ordinance shall comply with subsection (a) and with the requirements of the Rules and regulations of the board of trustees regarding amendment and transfer of plan assets.
(2)
In addition to other requirements, such ordinance shall:
a.
Designate a new trustee or trustees to replace the board of trustees.
b.
Establish a termination date, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the board of trustees, which shall be used for purposes of the final audit.
c.
State that the existing retirement rights of employees, participants and beneficiaries shall not be impaired.
(3)
The board, in accordance with its current rules and regulations, shall cause to be prepared an audit of the GMEBS investment fund in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices to determine the value of the city's trust fund as of the termination date. The board shall then deduct from the trust fund the total expenses incurred or to be incurred by GMEBS in terminating the plan. Distribution of assets to the successor trustees shall then occur within the time limits specified in article XII of the joint trust agreement.
(c)
Termination of the Plan and Distribution of Assets to Retired Participants, Beneficiaries and Other Participants.
(1)
The employer expects the plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate the plan and contributions thereunder at any time by action of the governing authority. Such termination shall be accomplished by the adoption of an ordinance by the governing authority terminating the plan. Such ordinance shall conform to the rules and regulations of the board of trustees governing plan termination.
(2)
Upon termination, all eligible employees shall be deemed to be participants, and the accrued benefits of such participants shall be vested. The pension committee shall notify participants, terminated participants, retired participants, and beneficiaries of the termination of the plan, and shall provide a copy of such notice and the names and addresses of the persons notified to the board.
(3)
Upon termination, the employer shall provide to GMEBS current participant information necessary to calculate accrued benefits. Upon receipt of such information, GMEBS shall prepare a list of all participants and beneficiaries, showing for each the present value of his accrued benefit as determined by the GMEBS actuary as of the date of termination.
(4)
The board, in accordance with its current rules and regulations, shall cause to be prepared an audit of the GMEBS investment fund in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices to determine the value of the city's trust fund as of the termination date. All mandatory participant contributions, if any, plus interest, shall be paid from the trust fund to the participants. The board shall then deduct from the trust fund the total expenses incurred or to be incurred by GMEBS in terminating the plan. The board, pursuant to its rules and regulations, shall then allocate the remaining assets to the city for distribution of the present value of accrued benefits in lump sums to the classes listed below. The benefits of each class shall be satisfied before proceeding to the next class. If at any time the remaining plan assets would be insufficient to provide the present value of accrued benefits for the class in question, the remaining assets shall be applied on a pro rata basis within that class, and all subsequent classes shall receive no benefit.
a.
Class 1: Retired participants or beneficiaries who are receiving payments as of the termination date.
b.
Class 2: Participants delaying retirement beyond the normal retirement date.
c.
Class 3: Participants eligible for early retirement.
d.
Class 4: Other participants, terminated or active, who have met the requirements for vesting as of the termination date.
e.
Class 5: All other participants on a pro rata basis.
Payment of benefits to retired participants, beneficiaries and participants by GMEBS as a result of a plan termination shall be limited solely to the assets available in the trust fund.
(5)
In its termination ordinance, the governing authority shall instruct GMEBS as to the distribution of excess assets, if any, remaining after the satisfaction of accrued benefits for the classes enumerated herein. In the absence of such instructions, any excess assets shall be distributed to the Employer.
(6)
Upon distribution of the assets as specified above, the plan and contract shall be regarded as terminated; and no participant or beneficiary shall have any further rights or claim therein.
(d)
Involuntary Termination.
(1)
GMEBS may discontinue administration of the plan and terminate its trusteeship in the event of any of the following occurrences:
a.
Failure of the employer to comply with the terms of the contract, including but not limited to failure to pay required contributions; or
b.
Insistence by the employer on enforcing an amendment to the plan which the Board has disapproved; or
c.
Failure of the employer to adopt within six (6) months any plan amendment which the board has deemed necessary to keep the plan in compliance with applicable state or federal laws or regulations.
(2)
In the event of an involuntary termination, the members of the governing authority shall become successor trustees for the plan.
(3)
The board shall notify the governing authority, participants and beneficiaries in writing of an involuntary termination and the reasons therefor. The notice shall also fix a termination date. Payment of benefits to retired participants and beneficiaries shall become the responsibility of the governing authority, as successor trustees, as of the termination date.
(4)
The board, in accordance with its current rules and regulations, shall cause to be prepared an audit of the GMEBS investment fund in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices to determine the value of the city's trust fund as of the termination date. The board shall then deduct from the trust fund the total expenses incurred or to be incurred by GMEBS in terminating the plan. Distribution of assets to the governing authority, as successor trustees, shall then occur within the time limits specified in article XII of the joint trust agreement.
