Ductile iron, mechanical or push-on joint, pipe may be used on piers in gravity sewer lines. Pipe shall be laid with One-fourth-inch clearance in each joint to provide for expansion. On mechanical joint pipe the bolts shall be tightened alternately 180 degrees apart but be left "finger-tight" until the sewage is diverted into the sewers; then bolts shall be further tightened a sufficient amount which will prevent leakage of the joint, but which will not prevent slippage which may occur because of temperature stresses.
(5)
Selected backfilling. All trenches shall be backfilled immediately after pipes are laid therein, and joints have been inspected by the engineer, unless other protection of the pipeline is directed. Selected backfill material shall consist of finely divided earth, stone dust, sand, crushed stone, or other approved material carefully placed about the pipe and up to a height of at least 12 inches above the top of the pipe barrel, and in uniform layers not exceeding six inches in thickness, each layer thoroughly compacted with proper hand tools in a manner which will not disturb and/or injure the pipe. Backfilling shall be carried on simultaneously on both sides of the pipe and in a manner which will prevent injurious side pressures. If suitable select materials are not available from the trench excavation, the contractor will be required to obtain the select materials elsewhere.
(6)
General backfilling. After selected backfill material has been placed and tamped, the remainder of the trench may be backfilled with general excavated material, except that no rock, unless in small shattered fragments, will be permitted to be mixed with other backfill material.
(7)
Pipe stabilization. Wherever the subgrade is by nature too soft or mucky for the proper installation of the pipe, the contractor shall undercut the trench and backfill with crusher run stone or crushed stone three-fourths-inch in size and less. The stone shall be brought to the subgrade required by the class of bedding for the particular location and compacted.
(8)
Jointing dissimilar pipe. Dissimilar pipes shall be joined together using flexible couplings. Concrete collars will be permitted only if flexible couplings are not available in sizes needed. Concrete collar shall be constructed of Class "A" concrete and shall be poured so as to completely and securely encase the entire joint.
(9)
Connections to existing sewers. At locations where new sewers are shown to be connected to existing sewers at a new manhole, the contractor shall first expose the existing sewer, install a supporting timber beam, strap the pipe with suitable straps, and attach the straps to the beam; all in a manner which will bridge the excavation for the new manhole. The manhole shall then be constructed, and be complete with invert, frame, and cover. Under special conditions, and with approval by the engineer, the contractor may temporarily block and/or divert sewage flows to facilitate construction operations. Actual physical connection of the sewers will be made at a later date, as directed by the engineer.
(10)
Replacement of concrete curb and gutter, street, driveway and sidewalk. Concrete curb and gutter, street, driveway and sidewalk shall be replaced with Class "A," 3,000 psi concrete of the same thickness and dimensions as was removed.
(11)
Roadway and railroad crossing. The subdivider or his contractor shall install pipe lines across a roadway or railroad in accordance with the applicable regulations of the state department of transportation or governing railroad body. Recently paved city streets shall be bored and cased in steel casing at least 1½ times the proposed pipe outside diameter. Steel pipe casing shall be manufactured from steel conforming to ASTM A 252 Grade 2 with a minimum yield strength of 35,000 psi before cold forming. The casing ten inches in diameter and less shall be a minimum of 0.375-inch wall thickness. Casing greater than ten inches shall be a minimum of one-half-inch wall thickness. When crossing city streets, the casing shall extend at least five feet off of the edge of pavement on each side. Coating for the casing is not required. The pipe shall be supported by skids within the casing such that the pipe bell does not rest on the bottom of the casing. When the city street is in disrepair, the street may be open cut trench in accordance with state department of transportation standard 1401.
(e)
Testing and cleaning. Before acceptance of any sewer or systems of sewers, lines shall be cleaned and tested. Where any obstruction is met, the contractor will be required to clean the sewers by means of rods, swabs, or other instruments. Lines and manholes shall be clean before final inspection. Pipe lines shall be straight and show a uniform grade between manholes. The contractor shall be required to correct any defective pipe which may be disclosed during the inspection. Each section of sewer between manholes shall show, upon examination from either end, a reasonably full circle of light.
(f)
Deflection testing for PVC pipe. The maximum deflection in the installed PVC pipeline shall not exceed five percent of the pipe's original internal diameter. Deflection testing will be required using either a deflectometer or a "GO-NO-GO" mandrel. Where deflection is found to be in excess of five percent of the original pipe diameter, the contractor shall excavate to the point of excess deflection and carefully compact around the point where excess deflection was found. The line shall then be retested for deflection. However, should after the initial testing the deflection pipe fail to return to the original size (inside diameter), the line shall be replaced.
(g)
Leakage tests. All sewer lines, including house service lines, shall be tested for leakage, in the presence of the engineer or his representative, before being placed into service. Tests shall be conducted by one or a combination of the following three methods:
(1)
Infiltration test. Where natural groundwater levels stand a minimum of two feet above the top of the pipe, the amount of leakage may be determined from measurements made at the lower end of the sewer section under test. Sewers above the test section shall be closed before testing by the installation of suitable watertight bulkheads. The length of the test section shall be determined by the engineer. The average of six readings at five-minute intervals will be used to determine the rate of infiltration for any one test section. The rate of infiltration of groundwater into any test section of sewer, including manholes, shall not exceed the following:
EXPAND
Sewer Size (in.) Gallons Per 24 Hrs. Per Foot of Sewer
6 0.12
8 0.15
10 0.19
12 0.22
15 0.28
  (2)
Exfiltration test. Where natural groundwater levels do not stand two feet above the top of the pipe, an exfiltration test shall be conducted on each section of sewer. The test shall be performed up to an average maximum hydrostatic head of ten feet. The test shall be conducted in the following manner:
a.
The ends of the pipe in the test section shall be closed with suitable watertight bulkheads. Inserted into each bulkhead at the top of the sewer pipe shall be a two-inch pipe nipple with an elbow. At the upper end of the test section a riser pipe shall be installed. The test section of pipe shall be filled through the pipe connection in the lower bulkhead which shall be fitted with a tight valve, until all air is exhausted and until water overflows the riser pipe at the upper end. Water may be introduced into the pipe 24 hours prior to the test period to allow complete saturation. House service lines, if installed, shall also be fitted with suitable bulkheads having provisions for the release of air while the test section is being filled with water.
b.
During the test period, which shall extend over a period of 30 minutes, water shall be introduced into the riser pipe from measured containers at such intervals as are necessary to maintain the water level at the top of the riser pipe. The total volume of water added during the 30-minute test period shall not exceed that shown for infiltration in subsection (g)(1) of this section.
(3)
Low-pressure air test. Where sewer grades are such that preclude performance of the exfiltration test or at the contractor's option, a low-pressure air test shall be conducted on each section of sewer after completion and before acceptance.
a.
Prior to air testing, the section of sewer between manholes shall be thoroughly cleaned and wetted. Immediately after cleaning or while the pipe is water soaked, the sewer shall be tested with low-pressure air. At the contractor's option sewers may be tested in lengths between manholes or in short sections (25 feet or less) using air-lock balls pulled through the line from manhole to manhole. Air shall be slowly supplied to the plugged sewer section until internal air pressure reaches approximately 4.0 psi. After this pressure is reached and the pressure allowed to stabilize (approximately two to five minutes), the pressure may be reduced to 3.5 psi before starting the tests. If a 1.0 psi drop does not occur within the test time, then the line has passed the test. If the pressure drops more than 1.0 psi during the test time, the line is presumed to have failed the test, and the contractor will be required to locate the failure, make necessary repairs and retest the line. Minimum test time for various pipe sizes, in accordance with ASTM C 828, as amended to date, is as follows:
EXPAND
Nominal Pipe Size (in.) Time (min.)/100
4 0.3
6 0.7
8 1.2
10 1.5
12 1.8
  b.
Required test equipment includes air-lock balls, braces, air hose, air source, timer, rotometer as applicable, cut-off valves, pressure reducing valve, 0-15 pressure gauge, 0-5 pressure gauge with gradations in 0.1 psi and accuracy of two percent.
c.
The contractor shall keep records of all tests made. A copy of such records will be given to the engineer or the owner. Such records shall show date, line number and stations, operator and such other pertinent information as required by the engineer.
(4)
Repairs. All visible leaks shall be repaired regardless of whether infiltration, exfiltration or air test is within allowable limits. No sewer will be accepted until leakage tests demonstrate compliance with one of the above leakage test methods.

ARTICLE V. - LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING SPECIFICATIONS

Sec. 104-93. - Purpose.
(a)
It is the purpose of this article to provide environmentally sound landscape amenities screening design standards which promote a positive community image by promoting quality development, enhancing property values, providing for landscape improvements in the city and promoting orderly growth and aesthetic quality in the city. It is also the intent to promote a healthy, natural environment whenever possible by protecting and enhancing existing vegetation.
(b)
Landscaping enhances a community's environmental and visual character and improves the overall quality of life. Vegetation can also improve air and water quality, reduce soil erosion, reduce noise and glare, provide habitat for wildlife, moderate the climate and enhance property values, thus protecting the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(c)
However, inappropriate landscaping can degrade the quality of the natural environment by requiring excess water and pesticides, or by creating unnecessary conflicts with sewers, sidewalks and vehicle access. Thus it is important to promote environmentally sound landscaping, including the use of low-maintenance, drought-resistant and native or non-invasive plants, and to ensure that the right tree is planted in the right place. Environmentally sound landscaping also means prohibiting the use of invasive and potentially invasive species. Although well-mannered, non-native species can be welcomed additions to a landscape, invasive species can cause severe economic and environmental harm (including crop damage and degradation of native habitats) and can engender significant control costs.
(d)
This article also establishes standards for screening in required buffers. Buffers between two incompatible uses minimize harmful impacts such as transmission of noise, dust and glare. Buffers can also lessen visual pollution, establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, and thus protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community. The presence of trees and other vegetation aids in stormwater management, helps to prevent erosion, improves air quality, conserves energy, provides wildlife habitat and preserves and enhances property values.
(e)
Additionally, this article is intended to require the landscaping of new parking lots in order to reduce the harmful effects of wind and air turbulence, heat and noise, and the glare of motor vehicle lights; to prevent soil erosion; to provide shade; and to enhance the appearance of parking lots.
(Ord. of 10-20-2008, § 1)

A landscape plan consists of a site plan showing the boundaries of the property and the location of proposed plant materials, in relation to surroundings and improvements, along with a planting schedule and any additional specifications required by the codes enforcement officer.
Landscaping means any combination of living plants, such as trees, shrubs, vines, ground covers, flowers, or grass, and which may include natural features such as rock, stone, bark chips or shavings, and structure features, including but not limited to fountains, pools, outdoor artwork, screen walls, fences or benches.
Natural area means an area containing natural vegetation that will remain undisturbed when the property is fully developed.
Perimeter landscaping means the use of landscape materials adjacent to the outer boundary of a parcel, or the outer boundary of a lease line, or the outer boundary of the developed area of a parcel.
Revegetation means the replacement of trees and landscape plant materials.
Screen means a method of reducing the impact of noise and unsightly visual intrusions with plants, berms, fences, walls or any appropriate combination thereof, to provide a less offensive or more harmonious environment in relation to abutting properties.
Shrub means a woody plant, smaller than a tree, consisting of several small stems from the ground or small branches near the ground and generally obtaining a height less than eight feet; a shrub may be deciduous or evergreen.
Tree means any self-supporting, woody perennial plant usually having a single trunk diameter of three inches or more that normally attains a mature height of a minimum of 15 feet.

Sec. 104-101. - Buffers required.
Buffers for individual uses shall be provided according to the requirements shown on the table providing set distances in chapter 110, the land use chapter.
(Ord. of 10-20-2008, § 8)
Sec. 104-102. - Screening specifications in required buffers.
(a)
Screening shall be established along side and rear lot lines within all buffers that are required by the land development code. The arborist may require additional screening in the area outside required landscape strips and buffers, for purposes of obscuring features such as rear entrances, utility and maintenance structures, and loading facilities. Landscaping shall be used whenever possible to screen objectionable views, noises, or nuisances, such as service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, transformers, etc.
(b)
All required screening shall consist of shrubs and/or trees but may be permitted or required to be supplemented with walls, fences or earth berms. Screening shall be of such nature and density to screen activities on the lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting lot and shall provide year-round maximum opacity from the ground to a height of at least six feet. Trees and shrubs shall be installed to not only provide maximum opacity, but to allow for proper plant growth and maintenance.
(c)
To achieve maximum opacity within buffers, the following alternatives, or combination thereof, shall be considered by the applicant and applied, subject to the approval of the arborist:
(1)
Six-foot-high evergreen screening shrubs planted four feet on center.
(2)
Tall evergreen trees stagger-planted with branches touching ground.
(3)
Combination of small shrubs planted 30 inches on center, small trees planted 30 feet on center, and large trees planted 40 feet on center.
(4)
Six-foot-high masonry wall.
(d)
In selecting materials and the size of plantings to be installed, the applicant and the arborist shall consider the purpose of the landscape and the following required materials:
EXPAND
Purpose Materials
Very dense sight barrier Evergreen trees, sight-obscuring fence
Visual separation between uses Evergreen and deciduous trees, shrubs
Visual separation of uses Evergreen and deciduous trees, shrubs, berms
Provide visual relief Ground covers and shrubs lower than 36 inches

  (Ord. of 10-20-2008, § 9)
Sec. 104-103. - Landscape plan.
A landscaping plan approved by the arborist shall be required prior to the issuance of a land use permit or building permit to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Code. The landscape plan shall be based on an accurate boundary survey of the site or reasonable property description and shall include the following:
(1)
Location and general type of existing vegetation;
(2)
Existing vegetation to be saved;
(3)
Methods and details for protecting existing vegetation during construction;
(4)
Locations and labels for all proposed plants and a plant list or schedule showing the proposed and minimum required quantities;
(5)
Location and description of other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, and courts or paved areas.
(Ord. of 10-20-2008, § 11)
Sec. 104-104. - Approval of landscaping and other materials.
Approval of all landscaping and other materials by the arborist shall be required. The arborist shall have broad discretion in approving the specific types of landscaping and other materials provided in the landscape requirements of this Code. However, the following general guidance is provided and specific lists of approved species are provided in this Code:
(1)
The use of native plants as landscaping materials is encouraged wherever possible.
(2)
Invasive or potentially invasive plants are not permitted. However, well-mannered, non-native plants are acceptable if they are not considered invasive or potentially invasive.
(3)
Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be preserved, whenever possible, or replaced with suitable vegetation.
(4)
Ground cover should be used to supplement landscaping in appropriate areas to reduce the need for extensive grass lawns, which would require regular watering in drought conditions.
(5)
Grass areas shall be sodded. However, if grass seed must be used, it shall be a variety suitable to the area that produces complete coverage.
(6)
No artificial plants, trees, or other vegetation shall be installed.
(Ord. of 10-20-2008, § 12)
Sec. 104-105. - Tree planting guidelines.
(a)
Only healthy trees with a well-developed root system and a well formed top, characteristic of the species, should be planted.
(b)
Trees selected for planting must be compatible with the specific site conditions.
(c)
The ability of a species to regenerate a new root system and to become re-established should be considered. Generally, deciduous trees should be planted in the fall after leaf drop, or in early spring before bud break. There are indications that bare root trees will re-establish more readily if planted in early spring just prior to bud break.
(d)
Trees should not be planted deeper than they were in their former location or container.
(e)
Once the transplanted tree is set, the hole should be backfilled with soil of good texture and structure. Backfill material should be comprised of a mix of native soil, organic matter such as peat, and inorganic material such as pearlite or vermiculite in a 1:1:1 ratio, although a backfill with native soil alone may be adequate.
(f)
The addition of fertilizer to backfill soil can cause root injury and is therefore not recommended. If fertilizer must be added, a small amount should be used. Approximately 1.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of backfill is recommended for bare root plants, and 2.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of backfill for balled and burlaped trees.
(g)
The backfill should be gently tamped (but not compacted) and soaked for settling. The soil should be slightly mounded to allow for settling; a ridge or dike around the perimeter of the hole can facilitate watering.
(h)
Pruning. The amount of pruning necessary for newly planted trees depends upon the trees' response to planting. A decrease in leaf surface area from pruning can result in a reduction of the production of food, thus ultimately inhibiting root development. Pruning for vigor or to train young trees should therefore be delayed until after the first growing season.
(i)
Staking should be used on newly planted trees only where determined necessary. The extent of staking will depend upon tree strength, form and condition at planting, expected wind conditions, the amount of vehicle or foot traffic and the level of follow-up maintenance. Staking can cause tree damage. Periodic follow-up inspections are required to prevent serious treestaking problems. Staking should be removed as soon as the tree is capable of providing its own anchorage and support.
(j)
Mulching newly planted trees will reduce competition from weeds and moderate soil moisture and temperature extremes.
(k)
Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease or nutritional disorders.
(l)
Trees selected for planting must be free of root defects.
(Ord. of 10-20-2008, § 13)
Sec. 104-106. - Landscape maintenance and landscape bond.
(a)
The owner, occupant, tenant and respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection of all landscaping required to be installed pursuant to this Code.
(b)
Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer or owner shall post a maintenance bond or cash escrow guaranteeing all landscaping materials and work for a period of two years after approval or acceptance thereof by the city in a sum established by the arborist. The bond will be in the amount of 50 percent of the estimated cost of replacing all of the landscaping required by these specifications, unless otherwise specified by the arborist. The city arborist shall determine the value of the landscaping by using the means standard costs book or from a registered landscape architect. At the end of two years, the arborist shall make an inspection and notify the owner or developer and the bond company of any corrections to be made. If no maintenance is required, or if maintenance is provided by said responsible party, the arborist shall release the bond.
(c)
Due to adverse weather conditions as determined by the arborist, to include extreme drought, planting may be delayed and a certificate of occupancy will be issued if the owner posts performance bond or cash escrow. The performance bond will be in the amount of 100 percent of the proposed cost of the landscaping improvements from the approved landscape plan. The bond shall be for a period of two years and all landscaping improvements must be in place no later than the expiration of the bond. The landscaping improvements should be put in place at the termination of the adverse weather conditions if sooner than the expiration date of the bond. Once all of the landscaping improvements are in place and a maintenance bond or cash escrow is posted under the requirements of this section, the arborist shall release the performance bond.
