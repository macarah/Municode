DIVISION 5. - ADULT BUSINESSES

Sec. 8-140. - Purpose.
The purpose of this division is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed.

As to adult erotic dance establishments, this division represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
