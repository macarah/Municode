ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 40-190. - Findings.
modified
The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact:
(1)
The city is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III(a)(6) thereof and O.C.G.A. ยง 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout the city.
(2)
In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services.
(3)
In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the state and the City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal.
(4)
Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the city.
(5)
A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas.
(6)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs.
(7)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system.
(8)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on the city wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies by the city.
(9)
Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing development as well as future development and redevelopment in the city.
(10)
The city is required under federal and state regulations (i.e., the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Georgia Notice of Intent (NOI) and stormwater permit effective December 2012 to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature.
(11)
Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES phase II stormwater permit, along with other city stormwater program activities, will substantially increase the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities.
(12)
The cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system.
(13)
The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the stormwater utility rate study (including amendments) and related documents, dated April 2017 and prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, which report is incorporated herein by express reference, properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, defines the city's stormwater management program funding strategy.
(14)
Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs.
(15)
Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(16)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation report.
(17)
The services and benefits rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management services, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(18)
A stormwater management program (SWMP) provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility feasibility study dated December 2016, and the other related documents, that have been prepared for the city by its consultants.
(19)
A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council.
(20)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property.
(21)
The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge.
(22)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

Sec. 40-191. - Definitions.
modified
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. ยง 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto.
Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater user fee charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property.
Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's SWMP and the stormwater utility, including local, state, and federal governments. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities.
Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility.
Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the statistical average horizontal impervious surface area of a detached single-family residential property within the city as of the date of adoption of this article. The horizontal impervious surface area includes, but is not limited to, all areas covered by structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways, and sidewalks.
Government property shall include all local, state and federal government owned, operated, and maintained properties within the city.
Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition.
Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.
Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces.
Nonresidential property means improved property containing one or more nonresidential structures as defined by the city's zoning classifications: A-1, C-1, C-2, C-3, C3-PUD, and I-1. A nonresidential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or other type of structure located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a nonresidential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with nonresidential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, cottages or barns, and impervious driveways and sidewalks. Nonresidential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for residential purposes.
Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, current edition), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 36-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 18 feet (six times 36 inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e., typically the width of the creek). The city stormwater utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose.
Residential property means improved property containing one or more residential structures as defined by the city's zoning classifications: R-1, R-2, R-3, R-MH, and R-PUD. A residential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or other type of home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a residential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, impervious driveways, sidewalks, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Residential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes. Property in an agricultural zoning classification may also be classified as "residential property" if it meets the definition of residential property herein.
Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city.
Stormwater management services means all services provided by the city which relate to the:
(1)
Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city;
(2)
Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities;
(3)
Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;
(4)
Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and
(5)
Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements.
Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof.
Stormwater management systems and facilities means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff.
Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the city stormwater utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by the city for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered.
Stormwater utility manager means the person appointed by the mayor and city council to administer the provisions of this article.
Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface.
User means any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.
User classifications include residential, nonresidential and government properties.

Sec. 40-192. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established.
modified
(a)
There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the city stormwater utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated areas of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management services.
(b)
There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the city SWMP and stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the city stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall be used solely for stormwater management services. All expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management services as deemed appropriate by the city.
(c)
The city shall place responsibility with the stormwater utility manager for operation, maintenance and regulation of the SWMP and stormwater management services performed, owned and operated or maintained by the city, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights of entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management.
(Ord. No. 2017-6 , 9-18-2017; Ord. No. 2022-6 , 2-14-2022)
Sec. 40-193. - Scope of responsibility for stormwater management systems and facilities.
modified
Subject to the provisions of sections 16-173, 1-93, and 16-94 of this Code:
(a)
The city may own or have rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located:
(1)
Within public road rights-of-way;
(2)
On private property, but within easements granted to, and accepted by, the city, or are otherwise permitted to be located on such private property by written agreements for rights of entry, rights of access, rights of use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon;
(3)

Sec. 40-194. - Stormwater utility user classifications.
modified
(a)
There shall be one stormwater utility service area in the city with specified user classifications to reflect variations in services provided to stormwater utility customers and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city SWMP and drainage system. The specified user classifications for the city stormwater utility are as follows:
(1)
Residential customers located in the city, as defined in section 40-191 of this article.
(2)
Nonresidential customers, as defined in section 40-191 of this article, shall consist of all properties by zoning classification located in the city that are not classified as residential.
(3)
Government customers, as defined in section 40-191 of this article, shall consist of all properties owned, operated, and maintained by or for local, state, and federal agencies in the city, excluding public rights-of-way.
(b)
Documentation pertaining to the city stormwater utility user classifications shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection.
(Ord. No. 2017-6 , 9-18-2017; Ord. No. 2022-6 , 2-14-2022)
Sec. 40-195. - Stormwater user fee charges.
modified
(a)
It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments.
(b)
To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for onsite stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.
(c)
All properties receiving an exemption(s) not mentioned in the Stormwater Utility User Fee Credit Manual, either by state or federal law, rule or regulation, will be subject to a monthly system impact and administrative fee equal to 25 percent of what would, in the absence of the exemption, be the user's calculated stormwater utility fee.
(Ord. No. 2017-6 , 9-18-2017; Ord. No. 2018-6 , 6-11-2018; Ord. No. 2022-6 , 2-14-2022)
Sec. 40-196. - Stormwater user fee charge rates.
modified
(a)
Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the city stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city.
(1)
The stormwater user fee charge shall be in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the city council. The fee schedule pursuant to this article allows a $0.25 ERU rate increase each year for a period of ten years.
(2)
Residential customer class. All residential properties shall be charged a flat rate equivalent to one ERU.
(3)
Nonresidential customer class. All nonresidential properties as defined herein shall be billed one ERU for every 3,850 square foot increment, or portion thereof, of impervious surface. In cases where a fractional ERU is calculated, the total ERU for the customer account will be rounded down to the next whole number for billing. Increments of impervious surface less than 3,850 square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills (i.e., 500 to 3,849 square feet of impervious surface), which shall be billed at the rate for one ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the developed land shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased, or owned, interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior, or exterior, space available for occupancy. Fractional ERUs for nonresidential properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing.
(b)
The customers of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater user fee charge may be billed on a common statement and collected along with other city public utility charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for public services, i.e., water, sewer, natural gas and/or sanitation. If the improved property does not receive any other city public utility services, or is not being charged for public utility services due to vacancy, or non-use, at the time of stormwater user fee billing, then the owner of the property, shall be billed for stormwater management services by the city. Regardless of whether or not the developed land has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater user fee charges.
(Ord. No. 2017-6 , 9-18-2017; Ord. No. 2022-6 , 2-14-2022)
Sec. 40-197. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions.
modified
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities.
Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows:
(1)
Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(2)
Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(3)
Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties.
(4)
The city (city owned) public streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the city via the general fund. However, other improved property used for city purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.
(5)
Any property whereby 100 percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow, into the city owned storm drainage system.
(Ord. No. 2017-6 , 9-18-2017; Ord. No. 2022-6 , 2-14-2022)
Sec. 40-198. - Stormwater user fee charge credits.
modified
(a)
The stormwater utility manager shall grant credits or adjustments based on the technical and procedural criteria set forth in the stormwater utility credit technical manual. Copies of the credit technical manual will be maintained by and available from the stormwater utility manager.
(1)
A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit technical manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit technical manual.
(2)
Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit technical manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit technical manual or this article.
(3)
In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit technical manual.
(4)
Property owners may apply for any credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual.
(5)
The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format established by the stormwater utility manager. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing.
(b)
When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is accepted to either grant the credit in whole, grant the credit in part, or deny the credit. Credits applied for by the property owner and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the credit technical manual.

Sec. 40-199. - Enforcement methods and inspections.
modified
(a)
All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the city municipal court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in section 16-172 of this Code.
(b)
Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager the city may elect to sue in the city municipal court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the city municipal court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the city municipal court.
(c)
The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes:
(1)
Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on site; or
(2)
Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed.
(Ord. No. 2017-6 , 9-18-2017; Ord. No. 2022-6 , 2-14-2022)
Sec. 40-200. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments.
modified
Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Peach County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property.
(1)
Billing.
a.
Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue as established by the city council, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due.
b.
The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. For example, the fee may be applied on each customer water bill.
c.
Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city council.
d.
Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each improved property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments.
e.
If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the city stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period.
(2)
Delinquencies and collection.
a.
Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment or cutting off water service until the delinquency is resolved. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property.
b.
A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner.
(3)
Adjustments. The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge.
a.
If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought.
b.
Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request.
c.
Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review.
d.
In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct.
e.
The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing.
f.
If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill.
