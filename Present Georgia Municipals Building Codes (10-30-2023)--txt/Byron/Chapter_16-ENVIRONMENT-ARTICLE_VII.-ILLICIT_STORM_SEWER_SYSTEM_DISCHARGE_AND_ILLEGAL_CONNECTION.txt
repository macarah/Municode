ARTICLE VII. - ILLICIT STORM SEWER SYSTEM DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION

Sec. 16-260. - Purpose and intent.
(a)
It is hereby determined that:
(1)
Discharges to the city's storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's storm sewer system.
(2)
Therefore, the City of Byron adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the city's storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city's storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
(3)
The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the city's storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by state and federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the city's storm sewer system in order to among other requirements comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to:
a.
Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the city's storm sewer system by any person;
b.
Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city's storm sewer system;
c.
Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city's storm sewer system; and
d.
To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.
(b)
Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.
