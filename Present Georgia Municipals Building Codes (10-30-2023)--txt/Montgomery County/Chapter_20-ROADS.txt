Abandonment means the procedure for abandonment of a section of the County road system as described in O.C.G.A. § 32-7-2.
(Ord. of 11-12-2013, § II)
Sec. 20-117. - Petition.
(a)
Petition prerequisite to County action. Unless the Board of Commissioners, of its own accord, determines that it is in the public's interest to abandon a section of the County road system, the Board of Commissioners shall not commence the procedure for abandonment of a road unless a citizen of the County submits a petition as specified herein.
(b)
Contents of petition. The petition must be signed by a citizen of the County and contain the following:
(1)
Specific identification of the section of the County road system sought to be abandoned and specific identification of property owners of said section of road. A plat or accurate sketch of said section must be attached to the petition.
(2)
A detailed statement, explaining that the section of the County road system has ceased to be used by the public to the extent that no substantial public purpose is served by it or that its removal from the County road system is otherwise in the best public interest. The petition will not be accepted if the explanation does not on its face satisfy the required determination of O.C.G.A. § 32-7-2(b)(1).
(3)
A certification by the petitioner that if the petition is accepted, he will pay to the Board of Commissioners a sum necessary to give notice to property owners located on the section of the County road in question; to publish notice of a determination that a road should be abandoned in the newspaper in which the Sheriff's advertisements for the County are published once a week for a period of two weeks; and to retain the County Attorney for the purpose of giving advice to the County concerning the lawfulness of abandonment and to hold the public hearing necessary for abandonment. At the time of filing the petition, the petitioner shall make a deposit of $1,000.00, payable to the Board, which shall be credited against any sums actually expended by the Board to abandon the road. If the petition is accepted, as defined in subsection (d) of this section, the deposit becomes nonrefundable. If the petition is denied without expenditure, the deposit shall be refunded. If the cost of abandoning the road exceeds the amount of the deposit, the Board will send a bill to the petitioner for the difference between the actual cost to abandon the road and the amount of the deposit; said bill must be paid within ten days of the bill's date. Failure to pay the bill within ten days will result in a civil penalty equal to the amount of the bill plus 15 percent thereof.
(c)
Place of filing petition. The petition shall be filed with the Office of the Board of Commissioners.
(d)
Acceptance of petition. After the filing of the petition, discussion of the petition shall be scheduled for the first general meeting of the Board of Commissioners at least one day after the date of filing. At said meeting, the Board shall determine whether it will accept the petition. Acceptance occurs if a majority of the Board votes to move forward with the procedure for abandonment of the road in question. If accepted, and upon payment of the deposit, the Board shall commence the procedure for abandonment of a County road in accordance with applicable law. Acceptance of the petition and/or payment of the deposit shall not constitute a guarantee that the section of road in question will ultimately be abandoned.
(Ord. of 11-12-2013, § III)
