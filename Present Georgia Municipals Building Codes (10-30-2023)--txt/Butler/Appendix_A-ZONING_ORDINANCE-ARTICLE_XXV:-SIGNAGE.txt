ARTICLE XXV: - SIGNAGE

Section 1: - Purpose and Intent
It is the intent of this chapter to ensure that all signs within the City of Butler shall be erected, constructed and maintained in a manner which is compatible with the appearance of the surrounding neighborhood, which preserves the public safety, does not impede the visibility of traffic and generally promotes the aesthetic values of the community through the preservation of light, air and open space. Therefore, this article shall only govern the size, location, setback, height, illumination and number of signs in each of the use districts that are established. It is not the intent of this Article to regulate the content of signs. Current businesses with non-conforming signs are deemed acceptable and considered "grandfathered" into this ordinance at the time of this adoption by the Mayor and Council unless said sign is considered a danger to the general public.
(Ord. of 3-12-2019)
Section 2: - Repeal and Applicability
Any and all Signage Ordinance(s) heretofore enacted by the Mayor and Council of the City of Butler are hereby repealed and this ordinance shall govern. No sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained except in conformance with this Article.
