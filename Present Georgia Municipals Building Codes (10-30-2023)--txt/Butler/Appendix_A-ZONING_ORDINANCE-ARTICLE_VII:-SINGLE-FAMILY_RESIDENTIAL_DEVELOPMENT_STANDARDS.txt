ARTICLE VII: - SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

Section 1: - Purpose and Intent
The Single-Family Residential district is established to encourage development of low-density single-family, detached housing including stick-built, modular and manufactured homes and to encourage neighborhood maintenance and preservation. This district will allow a variety of housing options where public water and sewer services are available and when those public water and sewer services have the capacity to serve new development. This district will discourage development which would generate traffic levels and patterns on neighborhood roads that conflict with the roads' current capacity and acceptable service level.
