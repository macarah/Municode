ARTICLE IX: - MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

Section 1: - Purpose and Intent
The Multi-Family Residential District will allow a variety of higher density housing where public water and sewer services are available and when those public water and sewer services have the capacity to serve new development but discourage developments which would generate traffic levels and patterns on neighborhood roads in conflict with the road's current capacity and acceptable service level.

Review and Approval of MFR Application:
1.
An application for approval of an MFR request is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (a rezoning). This is because MFR districts area created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed MFR. Upon approval of the MFR, existing zoning must be changed to an MFR zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in Article XXVI, must be followed in granting the amendment to permit MFR. Approval of MFR zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the City Council.
2.
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map of Butler will be changed to indicate the MFR district. If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the Zoning Administrator the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
Properly revised site development plans.
3.
The official map will then be changed. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the Zoning Administrator.
4.
No building permits will be issued by the Zoning Administrator until the development plan has been approved by the City Council.
5.
The standard review time(s) for the Zoning Administrator will be ten (10) business days, per period of review, or per each submission or change in documents by the submitting party. If a period of more than ten (10) business days is required for review or approval the Zoning Administrator shall inform the submitting party of the delay and provide an estimated completion date.
D.
Issuance of Building Permits. The Zoning Administrator will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan, if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule and all other applicable regulations.
E.

1.
Minor extensions, alterations or modification of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the City Council; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
2.
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator and City Council after receipt of recommendations from the Zoning Administrator and City Council in accordance with the provisions of Article XXVI.
