(Ord. of 6-5-2000, § 10)
Sec. 14-45. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact.
(1)
The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitation. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation, water quality maintenance and control, flood control, erosion control, natural resources education, scientific study, open space, and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands and adjacent floodplains is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. A considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and welfare.
(2)
The state department of natural resources and the state department of community affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located within its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies legislation, and the rules promulgated thereunder. It is necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely impact wetlands.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the "Wetland Protection Ordinance of Warrenton, Georgia." The purpose of this article is to promote the appropriate protection and use of wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by the permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect the wetlands from alterations and encroachments which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and which will also comply with the requirements of federal and state laws related to wetland protection.
(Ord. of 6-5-2000, § 1)
Sec. 14-46. - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Applicability. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city clerk.
(b)
Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and the boundaries on this map are an approximation. The purpose of the map is to alert developers and/or landowners, if they are contemplating any activity within proximity to a wetland, that they are required to contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for specific guidance as to whether a Section 404 Permit will be required prior to any scheduled activity. All specific delineations of wetland boundaries, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended, shall be determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
(Ord. of 6-5-2000, § 2)
Sec. 14-47. - Local development permits.
(a)
Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed in the wetland protection district without a development permit from the city. The issuance of a local development permit by the city clerk is contingent upon the recommendation of the city engineer and full compliance with the terms of this article and other state and federal regulations. All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) of this section shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers letter stating either the Corps has no jurisdiction or a Section 404 Permit shall be required prior to the issuance of a city permit.
(b)
Permissible uses. The following uses shall be allowed within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other federal, state or local law:
(1)
Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting and reforestation practices, provided they meet the performance standards, and road construction best management practices required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Conservation or preservation of soil water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not adversely impact the waters of the state or the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 Permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, birdwatching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
(4)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission.
(5)

(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or

(d)
For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination.

The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(g)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(h)
The lien provided for in subsection (g) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of county superior court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection 14-221(a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket.

(i)
It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(j)
The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(k)
The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

(c)
Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.
Sec. 14-222. - Limitation of liability for code enforcement; no special duty created.
It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, life safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city.

The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner and his design professionals and contractors to satisfy such legal requirements.
Sec. 14-223. - General cleanliness of premises.
The owner and occupant of property within the city shall each be independently responsible for keeping the premises, including all buildings thereon and the full yard thereof, clean and free from all garbage, refuse, filth, dirt, ashes, trash, rubbish and other offensive materials.

Any person who keeps and maintains, either by himself or others, a common, ill-governed and disorderly house, to the encouragement of gaming, drinking, illicit drug activity, or other misbehavior, to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens, shall be guilty of an offense against the city; provided, however, before any person is charged under this subsection (a), written notice shall be given the owner of the property and the person in possession thereof by the chief of police stating the general, customary and common habits of the house, giving fair notice of this subsection and the conduct proscribed thereby.
(b)
Any person who shall allow any boisterous, noisy, drunken or riotous persons to assemble or remain in their house, apartment or upon their property, after receiving oral notice from a police officer that boisterous, noisy, drunken or carousing activities have caused complaint and annoyance to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens, shall be guilty of an offense against the city; provided, however, no person shall be charged under this subsection (b) unless the owner or person in possession of the premises has been afforded an opportunity to disburse the assembly or offending person from the premises. This subsection shall not preclude a police officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on private property after being notified by the owner or lawful occupant to depart.

Any person who willfully refuses to comply with the provisions of this article shall be cited to appear before the municipal court and, upon conviction, shall be fined not less than $100.00; each day of continued violation, after citation, shall constitute a separate offense.
