Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the River Corridor Protection District.
For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the county comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs.
Sensitive natural area. Any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:
Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
Rare or exemplary natural communities;
Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or
Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration.
Significant recharge areas. Those areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).
Single-family dwelling. A dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family.
Water resource district. A water resource district is a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district.
Wetlands. Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.
(Ord. of 1-8-2002, § 3)
Sec. 26-130. - Groundwater recharge area protection district.
(a)
Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.
(c)
District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection district is delineated according to the state department of natural resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)." Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 Edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this article.
(d)
Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
(1)
New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements.
(2)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
a.
A high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and
c.
A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size.
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the national resource and conservation service.
(3)
New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimum set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in subsections (d)(1)-(6) of this section) of the DHR Manual. The minimum lot size specified by this section shall not be less than the minimum lot size specified in the Peach County Land Development Resolution, section 81.1.
a.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
c.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
(4)
New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in subsections (d)(1)-(6) of this sections) of the DHR Manual. The minimum lot size specified by this section shall not be less than the minimum lot size specified in the Peach County Land Development Resolution, section 81.1.
a.
One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
b.
One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and
c.
One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
(5)
No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (hereinafter DHR Manual) and subsections (d)(3) and (4) above.
(6)
New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types (listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements.
(7)
Permanent storm water infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.

Notes to tables
Section A.
The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (3 or 4-bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area.
Section B.
The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
Section C.
Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
Section D.
The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors.
Section E.
There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent County zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met.
Section F.
The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example:
Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula:
X = 5,000 gal/day / 1,200 gal/acre/day
= 4.17 acres
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed.
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula:
Y = 5.000 gal/day / 600 gal/acre/day
= 8.33 acres
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed.
(e)
Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this article is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsection (d)(3), (4) of this section.
(Ord. of 1-8-2002, § 4)
Sec. 26-131. - Wetlands protection district.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities.
(b)
Purpose. The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas.
(c)
District delineation. The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the Generalized Wetlands Map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto.
The generalized wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(d)
Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in 26-131(e) shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district without a development permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(e)
Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetlands protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 Permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.)
(1)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(2)
Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(4)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
(6)
Education, scientific research and nature trails.
(f)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in the wetlands protection district:
(1)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
(2)
Hazardous or sanitary landfills.
(Ord. of 1-8-2002, § 5)
Sec. 26-132. - River corridor protection district.
(a)
Purpose. River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters.
The Flint River has been designated as a protected river by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Flint River as defined herein.
(b)
Establishment of Flint River Corridor Protection District. The Flint River Corridor Protection District is hereby designated and shall comprise all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Flint River within Peach County and being within 100 feet horizontally on the eastern side of the river as measured from the riverbanks. Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river although this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Flint River Corridor Protection District Map. The Map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference.
(c)
