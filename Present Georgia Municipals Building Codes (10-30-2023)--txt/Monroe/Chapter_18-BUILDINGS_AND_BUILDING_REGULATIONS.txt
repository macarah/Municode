The city clerk shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(c)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by this article unless such costs are waived by resolution of the city.
