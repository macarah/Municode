(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 98-202. - Definitions.
(a)
Alternative pretreatment technology. A manufactured apparatus approved by the general manager to be used in lieu of a standard grease interceptor for a new installation or modification to an existing installation for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this article.
(b)
Fats, oils, and greases. Organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or plant sources that contain multiple chain triglyceride molecules. These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures established in the United States Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 136, as may be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as "grease" or greases".
(c)
Grease trap. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Such traps are typically compact under the sink units that are near food preparation areas.
(d)
Grease interceptor. A structure or device designed for the purpose of removing and preventing fats, oils and grease from entering the sanitary sewer collection system. These devices are often below-ground units in outside areas and are built as two or more chamber baffled tanks.
(e)
Food service establishments. Those establishments primarily engaged in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption by the public such as restaurant, commercial kitchen, caterer, hotel, school, hospital, prison, correctional facility, and care institution. These establishments use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, nondrinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
(f)
Manifest. A pre-printed form in multiple parts (usually carbon copy) that is used to document the removal of pretreatment system waste contents and provides sufficient information to trace the origin, transport and final destination of said waste.
(g)
Pretreatment system. A more generic term inclusive of grease traps, grease interceptors, oil separators, sand traps or an alternative pretreatment technology system employed by a commercial establishment for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this article.
(h)
Pump-out cleaning. The approved method of cleaning a grease interceptor, when its effective capacity has been reduced by the accumulation of grease solids and sediments. A pump-out cleaning means the entire contents of the interceptor (liquids and solids) are removed (pumped out) into a transport tanker by a licensed hauler. Skimming, decanting and/or partial removal of interceptor contents are not to be permitted by the user.
(i)
User. Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional limits of the City of Monroe and/or the utility's service area who contributes, causes or permits the contribution or discharge of wastewater into the sewers of the utility, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
(j)
General manager. The director of the Monroe utilities network or his/her designated engineer.
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 98-203. - Food service establishment permit requirement.
All permitted food service establishments discharging wastewater to the utility's sanitary sewer collection system are subject to the following requirements:
(a)
Grease interceptor requirements: All permitted food service establishments are required to install, operate, and maintain an approved type and adequately sized grease interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with the objectives of this article. Plumbing to all grease interceptors must meet the requirements of the City of Monroe plumbing code.
(b)
Implementation: All new food service establishment facilities are subject to grease interceptor requirements. All such facilities must obtain prior approval from the general manager for grease interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a building permit. All grease interceptors shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Existing facilities with planned modification in plumbing improvements, with a building permit evaluation of $20,000.00 or more will be required to include plans to comply with the grease interceptor requirements. These facilities must obtain approval from the general manager for grease interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a building permit.
All existing food establishments, determined by the general manager, to have a reasonable potential to adversely impact the city's sewer system will be notified of their obligation to install a grease interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification letter.
(c)
Variance from grease interceptor requirements: Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed unless the general manager authorizes the installation of multiple indoor grease traps or other alternative pretreatment technology and determines that the installation of a grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible. The general manager may authorize the installation of multiple indoor grease traps where the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible due to space constraints or other considerations. If an establishment believes the installation of a grease interceptor is infeasible, because of documented space constraints, the request for an alternate pretreatment system removal device shall contain the following information:
(1)
Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building.
(2)
Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all services at that site.
Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to, devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. All alternative pretreatment technology systems must be appropriately sized and approved by the general manager.
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 98-204. - Wastewater discharge limitations.
No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject grease interceptor, grease trap, or alternative pretreatment technology system to exceed 250 milligrams per liter (mg/L), as defined by EPA test method 1664 or 100 mg/L, as identified by EPA test method 413 (CFC-113 used in EPA method 413 may not be available in the near future).
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 98-205. - Grease interceptor requirements.
(a)
Grease interceptor installation shall conform to the standard water main and sanitary sewer standards for the Monroe utility network. Grease interceptors when used, shall be sized to have a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes plus a 20 percent allowance for settled sludge.
(b)
Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with design approved by the general manager and shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention.
(c)
Grease interceptors shall be followed by a sampling manhole where samples of effluent from the grease interceptor may be taken for FOG analysis.
(d)
Grease interceptors shall be installed at a location where it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of intercepted grease. The grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of the building where food is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must meet the approval of the general manager (see section 98-207. Location and installation, below).
(e)
All new grease interceptor installations and modifications of existing systems shall be inspected by a representative of the utility prior to back-filling the tank(s) with earth. The plumber or installer shall notify the utility at least 48 hours in advance of requiring an inspection. Any deficiencies noted shall be corrected before a final inspection will be given. No certificate of occupancy will be issued for any establishment until the grease interceptor has passed a final inspection.
(f)
All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume. These devices should be inspected monthly. Users who are required to maintain a grease interceptor shall:
(1)
Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance with subsection 98-205(a) above by removing accumulated sediment, grease and oil regularly.
(2)
Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the device.
(g)
When cleaning is required, the user shall insure that the entire contents (liquids and solids) of the interceptor are being removed. Partial withdrawal, skimming or decanting by the transport tanker is not to be allowed.
(h)
Addition of enzymes or special microbes to the grease interceptor for the purpose of reducing frequency of pump-out cleaning shall be allowed, provided addition of such product(s) does not create odors, present a public health hazard, public nuisance or result in a violation of any other provision of this article.
Such allowance should not be construed as an endorsement in this article or by the utility that any enzyme or microbe product will actually produce the benefit claimed. Use of such products shall be solely at the discretion of the user.
If, upon inspection by a utility representative, a grease interceptor is found to be in need of cleaning, the only acceptable remedy will be a pump-out cleaning. A massive or slug dose of enzymes or microbes at that point will not be a satisfactory alternative to a pump-out cleaning, as the use of enzymes or microbes, as provided in this article, is allowed only for the purpose of routine maintenance.
Use of strong acids or bases to clean a grease interceptor is very dangerous and is strictly prohibited.
Use of any chemical to emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils, and greases to the extent that they solidify in the utility's sanitary sewer lines, lift stations, or treatment plant shall constitute a violation of this article.
(i)
The user shall maintain written records of inspection and maintenance, including copies of completed waste hauler manifests (see 9.6, below [sic]) for three years. All such records shall be made available for on-site inspection by representatives of the utility.
(j)
Sewer lines containing sanitary wastes are not allowed to be connected upstream from sewer lines intended for grease interceptor service.
(k)
Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following the adoption of this article, although installation of grease interceptors will be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this article for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from the grease interceptors. If, during this one year period an obstruction of a sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the utility will take appropriate enforcement actions against the generator or contributor of such grease, as stipulated in Chapter 3 of the City of Monroe Ordinance 125-88 [sic] and as may be amended from time to time.
(l)
Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall be provided over each grease interceptor chamber and sanitary fee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling activities.
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 98-206. - Grease trap requirements.
(a)
Upon approval by the general manager, a grease trap complying with the provisions of this section must be installed in the waste line leading from sinks, drains, and other fixtures or equipment in food service establishments where grease may be introduced into the drainage or sewage system in quantities that can effect line stoppage or hinder sewage treatment or private disposal.
(b)
Grease trap sizing and installation shall conform to the Uniform Plumbing Code.
(c)
No grease trap shall be installed which has a stated rate of flow of more than 55 gallons per minute, nor less than 20 gallons per minute, except when specifically approved by the general manager.
(d)
Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating conditions by periodic removal of the accumulated grease. No such collected grease shall be introduced into any drainage piping, or public or private sewer.
(e)
No food waste disposal unit shall be connected to or discharged into a grease trap.
(f)
Wastewater in excess of 140°F/60°C shall not be discharged into a grease trap.
(g)
Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following adoption of this article, although installation of grease traps will be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this article for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from the facility. If, during this one year period an obstruction of a sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the utility will take appropriate enforcement actions against the generator or contributor of such grease and as may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 98-207. - Location and installation.
(a)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed closest to the discharge source of the commercial waste. A subsurface pretreatment system must be located or installed no more than 50 feet from the discharge source. A subsurface pretreatment system installed beyond 50 feet must have approval by the utility.
(b)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed so that proper maintenance of the system does not create sanitary nuisances or health hazards and does not impact the environment.
(c)
Pretreatment systems must be located and installed so that they are accessible for maintenance. No heavy kitchen equipment, canisters, dumpster or trash compactor can block access to the pretreatment system.
(d)
Grease traps will be installed at a sink area, dishwasher, or kitchen equipment where grease must be collected prior to discharge to building waste line. Grease traps will be located above the floor. Recessed grease traps must have prior approval for installation.
(e)
Pretreatment systems constructed of materials and/or located such that they are subject to rust and corrosion of parts (e.g. pretreatment system located under a kitchen sink) which may impair the opening of the system for inspection, will require the user to provide access to the system. A failure to provide access for any reason will constitute a violation.
(f)
Pretreatment systems installed on the outside of a building will discharge to the sanitary sewer line below grade. The sampling/test manhole is considered the discharge point of the pretreatment system to the utility's sanitary sewer. The sanitary sewer connection from the pretreatment system will not be allowed to connect to the utility's sanitary sewer line by going under or through the building. The connection to the utility's sanitary sewer line must be entirely outside the bounds of the building structure. The connection from the building to the pretreatment system should be a direct straight line. Up to one 90-degree turn (or two 45-degree turns) in the sewer line will be allowed if a clean-out of equal size is provided at the turn(s) if a straight line is not obtainable. The test manhole will be located a maximum of four feet from the last tank in the pretreatment system.
(g)
Under certain circumstances, installation of an alternative pretreatment technology system will be allowed for users where an upgrade, repair, or installation of a standard grease interceptor would be otherwise required. However, the user's circumstances must meet one of the following criteria for an alternative pretreatment technology system to be allowed.
(1)
The user's facility must be located in an existing building structure predating the enactment of this article, where written documentation is submitted by a licensed engineer, contractor or master plumber to verify a standard grease interceptor is impossible to install due to space limitations and/or existing underground utilities or structures exist and cannot be relocated without causing undue hardship or interruption of services to a neighboring business.
(2)
An existing system predating the enactment of this article is found to be inadequate and an alternative pretreatment technology system will upgrade the existing system and bring the facility into compliance.
(h)
Any installation requiring more than one grease interceptor tank unit must place the tanks in tandem (series) as one single line, unless a variance is approved by the general manager. The multiple tanks must be installed so the waste from the building will flow from tank to tank. The distance between tanks shall not be greater than 12 inches.
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
Sec. 98-208. - Transport and disposal of grease trap/interceptor waste.
(a)
Transporters of commercial waste shall possess valid license and appropriate permit(s) for hauling grease trap/interceptor waste.
(b)
The utility requires that all grease interceptors and traps be pumped every 90 days in the presence of a utility representative. In order to comply with this, the utility will require 24 hours notice prior to the scheduled pumping. All pumping must be done Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., except at schools where pumping times are limited to 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
(c)
The transporter must remove the entire contents of any grease interceptor tank or pretreatment system that is serviced.
(d)
The transporter shall not co-mingle grease trap/interceptor waste with sewage or septic tank waste.
(e)
Transporters of commercial waste shall use only those disposal sites meeting the county, state, or federal, licensing and permit requirements to receive such waste in the State of Georgia.
(f)
A transporter shall not dispose of or discharge waste products in whole or in part to any sanitary sewer, storm sewer, lift station, or treatment plant except under special circumstances as may be specifically permitted in writing by the general manager.
(g)
The waste hauler shall complete a multipart manifest for each interceptor pump-out cleaning performed. The hauler is to provide the user with a partially completed copy of the manifest at the time of cleaning and within ten days return to the user and the utility a copy of the completed manifest showing that the waste was received by a licensed disposal/reclamation site. The waste hauler and the user shall maintain a file of copies of completed manifests for a period of three years and shall produce copies for inspection upon request by the general manager or his/her designated representative.
(h)
Any waste hauler whose vehicle spills or leaks waste material onto the street, highway or public or private property shall be subject to a traffic citation in addition to penalties, fines and liability for damages and clean-up costs.
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § I, 2-1-2005)
