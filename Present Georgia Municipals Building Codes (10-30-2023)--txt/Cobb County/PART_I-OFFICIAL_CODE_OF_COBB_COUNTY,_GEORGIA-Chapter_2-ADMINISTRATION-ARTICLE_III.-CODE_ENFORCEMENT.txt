ARTICLE III. - CODE ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 2-101. - Code enforcement division created; purpose.
It is hereby declared by the board of commissioners that the efficient enforcement of this Code and the county zoning and planning ordinances and development standards is best served through cross-utilization of county personnel for purposes of inspecting and enforcing certain codes and ordinances of the county. The county finds that the formation of a code enforcement division serves the economic interest of the county by maximum use of personnel.
(Ord. of 3-27-90; Code 1977, § 3-9.5-1; Ord. of 1-22-02)
Sec. 2-102. - Scope of duties.
Employees of the code enforcement division may:
(1)
Inspection. Subject to constitutional limitations, enter or inspect any building, land, structure or premises in the county for the purpose of inspection of the building, structure, land, premises and all utility connections associated therewith for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of all codes and ordinances of the county; provided, however, that:
a.
Efforts shall be made to conduct inspections during normal business hours, if practicable, or unless, in the discretion of the code enforcement officer, an emergency is deemed to exist.
b.
All code enforcement division personnel shall present themselves, if necessary, to gain entrance or access to the property, at the front door or entrance in order to identify themselves prior to accessing the premises. The code enforcement division personnel shall present official identification upon reasonable request. If code enforcement division personnel are unable to identify themselves prior to accessing the premises, they shall leave notification to the property owner after completing the inspection.
(2)
Enforcement.
a.
Upon ascertaining, being advised by another department or citizen, or believing that a violation of any code or ordinance exists, the code enforcement division shall cause a written notice to be directed to the owner of the property or such other appropriate representative, unless in the opinion of the code enforcement officer an emergency is deemed to exist.
b.
The notice shall state the following:
1.
The owner or controller of the property.
2.
The location, including district, land lot and parcel.
3.
Nature of the violation and penalties, if applicable.
4.
A provision for rectifying the violation without further proceedings.
5.
A time frame for compliance.
6.
A date for reinspection for compliance or mechanism for rescheduling an inspection, as applicable.
c.
Following the expiration of the time set forth in the notice, the code enforcement division shall cause a reinspection to be performed.
d.
If the violation has not been remedied, the code enforcement division shall issue a citation to the owner of the property and/or the responsible party, or refer the matter to the county attorney's office for their handling in accordance with the provision for enforcement under the applicable code section or ordinance.
e.
If the violation has been remedied, the property in question shall nonetheless be subject to reinspection or reinspections for substantially the same violation or violations after the notice enumerated in this section to ensure continued compliance. If during any such reinspection, it is discovered that compliance has lapsed and substantially the same violation or violations are once again in existence, the code enforcement division shall issue a citation to the owner of the property and/or the responsible party, or refer the matter to the county attorney's office for their handling in accordance with the provision for enforcement under the applicable code section or ordinance.
f.
If the code enforcement officer believes that an emergency is deemed to exist such that imminent harm or peril to life or property is likely or is authorized by the Code or ordinances, the code enforcement officer shall be authorized to immediately refer these matters, without notice to the owner, to the county attorney for immediate action as set forth under the applicable Code section or ordinance.
g.
In any matter where a court order was previously rendered regarding a similar subject matter, the code enforcement officer shall immediately issue a citation without the necessity of another notice.
h.
A notice described in subsection (2)a of this section shall be effective against the person noticed, for substantially the same violation anytime after the issuance of the notice.
