(o)
Use or abuse of drugs, controlled substances or alcohol while operating a city-owned vehicle.
(1)
Drug and alcohol use prohibited while driving. Alcohol or controlled substance use by a driving official shall be prohibited. Abuse of prescribed drugs by a driving official shall be prohibited. This shall include the use or possession of controlled substances, the abuse of prescription medications, the possession of prescription medications by anyone other than the person for whom the medication was prescribed, and the use or abuse of alcohol, while driving a city-owned vehicle.
(2)
Prescription drug use. Any official using prescription medication while driving or just before driving a city-owned vehicle shall do so in strict accordance with medical directions. It is the official's responsibility to notify the prescribing physician of the driving the official is planning to do and to ensure that the physician approves the use of the prescription medication while the official is driving.
The abuse and/or inappropriate use of legally prescribed drugs, including driving when the official knows or should know that he is potentially impaired due to prescription drug use, shall be prohibited and shall be deemed a violation of this policy.
(3)
Testing required after an accident. The occurrence of an automobile accident resulting in property damage, bodily injury or death, shall constitute reasonable cause for drug and alcohol testing of a driving official, promptly after the accident. A driving official shall take a drug and alcohol test whenever, while driving a city-owned vehicle, the driving official is involved in an automobile accident resulting in property damage, bodily injury or death. Such testing shall be required regardless of whether there is other evidence of use of alcohol or drugs by the driving official.
Immediately after such an accident, the subject driving official shall contact the city manager, who will arrange for prompt testing. Additionally, it shall be the duty of every official who witnesses an accident where another official is driving a city-owned vehicle, to promptly notify the city manager of any such accident.
Driving officials shall, at the time of testing, provide the testing laboratory with a list of those prescriptions and over-the-counter medications the official recently has used. The list of medications shall be kept confidential until there has been a test result. The list of medications shall be disclosed only to the medical review officer, who will determine whether the positive result was due to the lawful and medically approved use of any of the listed medications.
(4)
Consent for testing. Before a drug and/or alcohol test is administered, or after a test for convenience, a driving official involved in an automobile accident will be asked to sign a consent form authorizing the test and permitting release of test results to the City of Douglasville, the medical review officer and to the public generally. The consent form shall provide a space for the official to acknowledge that he has been notified of the requirements of this policy. If the driving official is not conscious or is unable to consent for other reasons after an accident and immediately prior to testing, then the driving official will be deemed to have consented to testing by virtue of having elected to drive the city-owned vehicle.
(5)
Refusal to consent or to test. An official who refuses to sign the required consent form or to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test as required shall be deemed to have violated this policy. An official who fails to appear at the designated collection site to submit to a required drug and/or alcohol test when so directed by the mayor, the mayor pro tempore or the city manager shall be deemed to have refused to submit to the test shall be deemed to have violated this policy. A "no show" shall include any attempt to adulterate a test sample or otherwise frustrate, impair, or otherwise impede the testing process.
(6)
Testing laboratory guidelines. All testing procedures shall be administered and accounted for by an approved laboratory and/or medical facility operating in compliance with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) or College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines.
Urine samples shall be provided in a private restroom stall or similar enclosure so that officials may not be viewed while providing the sample, unless circumstances require monitored testing. Outer garments, bags, briefcases, purses, or other containers will not be permitted into the test area. The water in the commode shall be colored with dye to protect against dilution of test samples. If the drug and/or alcohol test is to be conducted using a specimen other than urine (e.g., hair, saliva, blood, etc.), the sample shall be collected in a manner consistent with the privacy of the official and the need to minimize the possibility of adulteration and/or mislabeling of the sample.
Whenever an initial test for drugs and alcohol is found to be positive, the laboratory will then carry out additional tests pursuant to laboratory testing guidelines to confirm that the initial positive indication was correct. If the second procedure also indicates the presence of drugs or alcohol, the test result is considered a confirmed positive result.
(7)
Results of testing. Any results of an official's drug and alcohol screening shall be non-confidential. A confirmed positive result for use or abuse of controlled substances, drugs or alcohol for a driving official shall be evidence of violation of this article.
(8)
Violations. Each of the following shall be a violation of this article:
a.
The use or abuse of controlled substances, drugs or alcohol by a driving official, without regard to whether such conduct results in an automobile accident;
b.
Failure by a driving official to promptly report an automobile accident in which the driving official was involved;
c.
Failure by a witnessing official to promptly report an automobile accident in which a driving official was involved;
d.
Failure by a driving official to submit to and cooperate with drug and alcohol testing after an accident; and
e.
Failure by a driving official to sign the consent form for drug and alcohol testing after an automobile accident in which the driving official was involved.

If the board finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that allegations of the complaint have been sustained and that a violation of the standards of conduct of this article has occurred, then the ethics board shall forward to mayor and city council a written "finding of violation," which shall specify the section and subsection of this article violated and the conduct of the respondent city official(s) which caused the violation, and shall include a recommendation for any appropriate sanctions against the city official(s) found to be in violation. If the board fails to make a "finding of violation" by a preponderance of the evidence, that allegations of the complaint have been sustained and that a violation of the standards of conduct of this article has occurred, then the ethics board shall forward to mayor and city council a "finding of no violation," and the matter shall be dismissed.

Any respondent city official may make a statement or offer evidence to the mayor and council relevant to the issue of an appropriate penalty. The mayor shall have no vote, except in the case of a tie vote by the council.

Provided however, no failure or refusal of the ethics board or the mayor and council to take action pursuant to this article shall be reviewable by the superior court.
(j)
Bar against subsequent complaints. Where a complainant files a complaint for which the ethics board fails to make a "finding of violation" or for which the mayor and council fail to determine that any penalty is appropriate, the complainant shall be barred from filing any subsequent complaint against the same respondent city official for a period 12 months after termination of the original complaint proceeding.
