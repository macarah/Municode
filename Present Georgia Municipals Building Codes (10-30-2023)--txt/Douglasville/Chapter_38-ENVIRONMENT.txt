(3)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(4)
The county may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

(a)
The Douglasville Mayor and City Council do hereby find that:
(1)
Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy non-smokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer.
(2)
Second-hand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer.

Accordingly, the Douglasville Mayor and City Council find and declare that the purposes of this article are:
(1)
To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in certain public places and in certain public and private places of employment; and

To balance the need of non-smokers to breathe smoke-free air with the desire of smokers to enjoy tobacco products in public places.
