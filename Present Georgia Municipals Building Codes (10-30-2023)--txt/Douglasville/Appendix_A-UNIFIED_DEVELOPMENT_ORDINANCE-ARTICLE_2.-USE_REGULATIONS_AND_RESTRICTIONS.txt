2.
At the time of rezoning, whenever more than one class may be applicable, a land use interpretation of the community development director as to the appropriate class within the use chart for any proposed use, may be appealed to the city council.

e.
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower.
f.
Visual impact.
1)
Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
2)
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
4)
Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design.
5)
Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower.

1)
For towers 150 feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line.
2)
For towers more than 150 feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten feet wide shall be provided at the property line, except that no vegetated buffer shall be required atop the ground system for any transmission tower.
3)
The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a densely vegetated area at least five feet in height within two years of planting.
4)
Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff maintenance.
5)
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost, provided however, that no vegetation other than grass shall be required atop the ground system for any transmission tower.
6)
In lieu of these standards, the community development director may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses.

A.
Purpose and intent of provisions.
1.
Treatment of nonconformity. This section sets out the provisions that protect uses, structures and lots that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this UDO or a subsequent amendment, but no longer conform to the new regulations. The primary intent of the treatment of nonconformity is to allow continuation of these uses, structures, lots and signs until the end of their useful life, while encouraging conformance to the new regulations when it becomes reasonable.
2.
Nonconforming development declared incompatible. Lawful nonconforming uses, structures and lots are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with land uses, structures, lots and signs that conform to the requirements of the zoning districts in which the nonconformity exists. However, such nonconforming development may be "grandfathered" and may continue under the circumstances presented in this article for each type of development.
3.
Registration and recording. The community development director, or his/her designee, at the request of the landowner of record or an authorized representative, may issue a certificate of nonconformance, a parcel of record certificate and/or a merger by contiguity certificate to the owner of each known nonconforming use, nonconforming parcel and/or nonconforming structure. The community development director shall then record a copy of the certificate(s) in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court within 30 days of its issuance at the applicant's expense. No use of land or structures so registered shall be other than specified on the certificate(s), unless said use is in conformity with the provisions of the zone district in which the parcel is located.
B.
Nonconforming uses.
1.
Nonconforming uses; defined. A nonconforming use is a use or activity that was lawfully established prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this ordinance, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, is no longer a use or activity permitted by right or no longer meets or conforms to the requirements of this ordinance.
2.
Grandfathered nonconforming uses.
a.
To avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use of any structure or land at the time of the enactment of this ordinance or any subsequent amendment may be continued even though the use does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance, except that the nonconforming use:
b.
Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
c.
Shall not be re-established after its removal from the property or its discontinuance for six consecutive months or more.
d.
Shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity.
e.
If an existing use was lawfully established as a permitted use in a zoning district that is subsequently amended to require special use approval for such use, the existing use shall not require a special use permit solely as a result of the change in the law.
f.
The strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health shall be allowed upon order of such official.
C.
Nonconforming structures.
1.
Nonconforming structures; defined. A nonconforming structure is a structure or building whose size, dimensions or location on a property were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this ordinance, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, no longer meets or conforms to one or more such requirements of this ordinance.
2.
Grandfathered nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied and used, except that the nonconforming structure:
a.
Shall not be remodeled, repaired, rebuilt or altered to restore or maintain any nonconformity if the total gross square footage of new construction exceeds 50 percent of the gross square footage of the structure prior to destruction or alteration, unless the structure is a single-family residence.
b.
Shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity.
3.
Exceptions.
a.
If the public acquisition of a portion of a lot reduces any yard dimension to less than that required by this UDO, the structure shall not be considered nonconforming.
b.
Any structure within the historic district may have its façade or roof repaired or maintained if a certificate of appropriateness is not required.
c.
For residential lots, where any structure has encroached into a required setback and such encroachment was lawful at the time of construction, then further construction within the setback area vertical to the encroachment or parallel to the property line shall be allowed, so long as new construction does not encroach closer to the property line than the existing nonconformity. For residential lots, the remaining foundation of any partially demolished encroachment is sufficient as a "structure" to vest the nonconformity under this provision.
d.
For any structure having legal non-conforming façade materials, use of the same façade materials on a structure addition shall not be considered an increase in the non-conformity.
D.
Nonconforming lots.
1.
Nonconforming lots; defined. A nonconforming lot is a lot of record whose area, frontage, width or other dimensions were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this ordinance, and which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, no longer meets or exceeds one or more such requirements of the applicable zoning district.
2.
Grandfathered nonconforming lots. Where the owner of a legal lot of record at the time of the adoption of this ordinance does not own sufficient land to conform to the minimum lot size or lot width requirement of this ordinance, such lot may nonetheless be used as a building site.
3.
Combination of nonconforming lots; where required. If the owner of two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage, at least one of which is a nonconforming lot, decides to build on one or more of such lots, he must first combine said lots to comply with the dimensional requirements of this ordinance.
4.
Exception. If the public acquisition of a portion of a lot reduces the lot area, frontage, width or other dimension to less than that required by this UDO, such lot shall not be considered nonconforming.
E.

1.
Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before April 1, 2008.
2.
Existing development and on-going land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, as of April 1, 2008, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements.
3.
Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of April 1, 2008.
4.
