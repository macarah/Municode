2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and,
3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Douglasville until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the City of Douglasville.
f.
Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Douglasville may direct the property owner (at no cost to the City of Douglasville) to restore the flood carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Douglasville.

All substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than one foot above the flood depth number in feet specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 6.03.c.2.a.1)
2)
Substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice; and
3)
Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.
f.
Standards for subdivisions.
1)
All subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and provide base flood elevation data and future conditions flood elevation data;
2)
All residential lots in a subdivision proposal shall have sufficient buildable area outside of the future conditions floodplain such that encroachments into the future conditions floodplain for residential structures will not be required;

All subdivision plans will provide the elevations of proposed structures in accordance with subsection 6.03.C.2.b, floodplain management plan requirements.
4)
All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
5)
All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters, and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; and
6)
All subdivision proposals shall include adequate drainage and stormwater management facilities per the requirements of the City of Douglasville to reduce potential exposure to flood hazards.
5.
Variance. Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided.
For flood management purposes the following definitions apply:
Basement: any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building: see structure
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision: the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision: a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before June 25, 1982.
Existing construction: for the purpose of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before June 25, 1982. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures."
Manufactured home park or subdivision: a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
New construction: any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after June 25, 1982 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure.
Recreational vehicle: a vehicle which is:
(a)
Built on a single chassis;
(b)
Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
(c)
Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
(d)
Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Structure: for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Structure, for insurance purposes, means:
(a)
A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site;
(b)
A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile home, is a structure built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or
(c)
A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the City's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws.F
For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or similar vehicle, except as described in (c) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank.
Substantial damage: damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term includes repetitive loss.
Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure, taking place during a 10-year period, in which the cumulative costs equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of a building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the building official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

Sec. 6.04. - E environmental.
A.
Purpose. Environmental districts are established for the following purposes:
1.
To promote health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution.
2.
To create vegetation buffer areas adjacent to rivers, creeks and streams, and to protect wetlands and groundwater recharge areas.
B.
Restrictions on use within the environmental overlay districts.
1.
Authority. The Official State of Georgia Department of Natural Resources Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria (Chapter 391-3-16), established pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-2-8, the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. sections 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), and other relevant rules and statutes.
2.
Characteristics of environmental overlay districts. These districts shall overlay the base zoning of properties so that all land within the various environmental overlay districts shall also have a base zoning classification. Each parcel within these overlay districts shall be subject to the regulations of both the base zoning district and the overlay district(s) within which it lies. If there is a conflict or redundancy between the regulations and standards of the zoning district and the overlay zone, the more restrictive regulation shall govern.
3.
Districts.
a.
Groundwater recharge area protection district (GW). The GW district is established to protect the quality of groundwater by regulating land uses within significant groundwater recharge areas. This is necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, particularly those persons and communities who rely on groundwater as their source of potable water supply.
The GW district is mapped on the Official Zoning Map of Douglasville corresponding to the areas mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1999 edition.
1)
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the Douglas County Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installations as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources for On-Site Sewage Management (DHR Manual), and sections 6.04 B.3.a.2) and 6.04 B.3.a.3).
2)
New homes served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having at least 110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of Table MT-1 in the DHR Manual. The minimums set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors set forth in sections Aâ€”F of the DHR Manual. However, any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of these regulations is exempt from this requirement.
3)
New mobile home parks shall be served by sanitary sewer.
4)
New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they exceed 50 acre-feet. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than five Ã— 10-7cm/sec. or other criteria established by the Natural Resource and Conservation Service.
5)
New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements.
6)
New facilities that handle hazardous materials of a type and amounts requiring a permit from the Department of Natural Resources or that require disposal at a hazardous materials facility by a hazardous materials handler permitted or licensed by the Department of Natural Resources, shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems. Such spill and leak collection systems shall be shown on the development plan in detail and must be approved as part of the development plan.
b.
Wetlands protection district (WP). The WP district is established to promote the protection of wetlands in Douglasville, which are indispensable, fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. Furthermore, they provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; opportunities for study and education; and open space and recreational opportunities.
Wetlands are commonly lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal and cumulative losses will have the effect of destroying additional wetlands over time. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
The WP district shall comprise the following two categories: all lands mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps (Generalized Wetlands Map); and all lands that, in the course of development review, are determined by Douglasville to have significant evidence of wetlands.
The generalized wetlands map is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this UDO, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The generalized wetlands map cannot serve (and therefore should not be used) as a substitute for a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any action by Douglasville under this UDO does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
1)
No activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the U.S. (excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act) will be permitted within the WP district without written permission or a permit from Douglasville.
2)
A wetlands delineation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall be required in the following circumstances:
a)
If the area proposed for development is located within 100 feet of an area delineated as wetlands by the generalized wetlands map as determined by city staff.
b)
If an area within a development site is determined by city staff to have significant evidence of wetlands.
3)
If the corps determines that wetlands are present on a proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is issued.
4)
Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein, and provided they have no impact on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of a Section 404 permit or a permit under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.
a)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit.
b)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing.
c)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
d)
The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture.
e)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and the approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
f)
Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
5)
Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited within the wetlands protection district.
a)
Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants;
b)
Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills;
c)
Any other use not specifically exempted as noted above or properly approved by Douglasville and relevant state and federal agencies.
c.
Watershed protection districts. In order to provide for the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life of the public within Douglasville and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. Land disturbance and development can increase erosion and sedimentation that decreases the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation.
The purpose of these districts is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of Douglasville, as well as the City of East Point and jurisdictions downstream from Douglas County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of water supply watersheds.
These district regulations are designed for compliance with O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-2-8 and the Official Georgia Department of Natural Resources Rules for Environmental Planning, as well as for consistency with the goals of the Douglasville Comprehensive Plan.
All land within incorporated Douglasville is regulated by one of the watershed protection districts. The districts are established and designated on the Official Zoning Map of Douglasville corresponding to the topographical features that delimit the drainage basins of the respective creeks, rivers and reservoirs.
1)
General regulations for all watershed protection districts.
a)
Required stream buffers (but not regulated streams or wetlands) may be included in the gross land area for purposes of calculation of the percentage of a site's impervious surface area.
b)
All property within watershed protection districts may be developed or re-developed as permitted by its base zoning, provided the development is also in compliance with these watershed protection regulations.
c)
The following uses are exempt from watershed protection district regulations (with some limitations and conditions as noted):
i.
Development and land use legally established prior to the adoption of these regulations.
ii.
Mining activities permitted by the Department of Natural Resources under the Surface Mining Act (outside of stream buffer areas).
iii.
Specific forestry and agricultural activities (outside of stream buffer areas) that are consistent with best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission/Department of Agriculture and do not impair the quality of streams.
d)

Regulated activities include all impervious surfaces, septic tanks, drain fields, and animal/livestock pasturing, keeping, or grazing.
3.
Measured from edge of wetlands where present.
4.
See definition of "impervious surface", article 13, definitions. For most development, impervious surface calculations shall be required on a lot-by-lot basis. However, in master planned communities, the maximum percentage can be met on a project-wide basis provided that the project is planned in detail and adequate controls are established (through deed restrictions, zoning plans and conditions, or other mechanisms) to ensure compliance.
e)
Regulatory requirements for stream buffers. All stream buffer areas shall be maintained with appropriate indigenous plant species for the maintenance of groundcover and limitation of erosion.
Undisturbed natural vegetation is the preferred, optimum state of a stream buffer. In the alternate, careful re-establishment of indigenous vegetation and ground cover is encouraged.
No construction, grading, clearing, grubbing, excavating, filling, or other land disturbing activity shall be permitted within the stream buffer. As an exception to this rule, the following limited uses may be established within the buffer provided that: land disturbance and impact in the stream buffer is minimized to the greatest extent possible; proper soil erosion and sedimentation control is established and maintained; and the disturbed area is stabilized and appropriately revegetated as soon as possible following the completion of approved work within the buffer.
i.
Sanitary sewer lines may be located along and across stream buffers, if it is determined by water and sewer authority (WSA) that no reasonable design alternative exists.
ii.
Other utility lines may cross stream buffers, when it is determined by the utility provider that no reasonable design alternative exists.
iii.
Private driveways and public roads may cross stream buffers as near as possible to 90 degrees when necessary and as approved by Douglasville in the subdivision or development review process.
iv.
Recreational amenities (such as trails, wildlife observation stands, and other low impact uses) when approved by Douglasville as an element of a development plan.
v.
Cutting and clearing (with handheld tools) of live trees less than two inches in caliper measure at a point four and one-half feet above grade, and dead trees, provided the stumps and root structure of trees are left in place to ensure minimal soil erosion potential.
f)
Regulatory requirements for reservoir buffers.
i.
Buffers around public water supply reservoirs shall be maintained as required in the watershed management plans for the respective reservoirs. In no case shall the required buffer be less than 150 feet in width.
ii.
Buffers around private reservoirs shall meet the same criteria as for stream buffers in subsection 6.04 B.3.c.1)e), regulatory requirements for stream buffers. However, all improved areas within the required buffers of existing private reservoirs (such as lawns, docks, patios, etc.) may continue to be maintained as they exist at the time of the adoption of these regulations.
2)
