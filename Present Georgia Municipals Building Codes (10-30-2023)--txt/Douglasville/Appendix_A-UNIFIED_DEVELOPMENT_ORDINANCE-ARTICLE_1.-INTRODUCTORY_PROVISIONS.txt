Legislative reviews — involve a change in land use policy. A public hearing is required, and final approval must be made by the city council after or upon staff recommendation. Examples include rezoning decisions, final plat approvals, and comprehensive plan amendments.
2)
Quasi-judicial reviews — involves the application of discretionary standards required by this UDO to an application. It requires procedural due process and a public hearing before the board of adjustments and appeals or city council. Examples include, special land use permits, temporary land use permits, variances other than administrative variances, and appeals of administrative decisions, as well as design reviews that require interpretation of a set of design guidelines.
3)
Administrative reviews — involve the application of the standards of the UDO to an application by the community development director or their designee. A public hearing is not required. An administrative approval typically occurs late in the development process. Examples include development plans not requiring rezoning, administrative variances, building permits, sign permits, special event permits, and certificates of occupancy.

  Sec. 1.03. - Zoning map.
A.
Official zoning map.
1.
The boundaries of the various zoning districts are shown on a map entitled "Official Zoning Map of the City of Douglasville, Georgia" adopted on the date of adoption of this UDO, and as amended thereafter from time to time.
2.
The "Official Zoning Map of the City of Douglasville, Georgia" is adopted as the official zoning map and is hereby made a part of this UDO, and all notations, references and other information shown on it shall be a part of this UDO.
3.
The official zoning map, as adopted by the city council and subsequently amended from time to time by its action, shall be maintained and available for inspection in the planning and zoning department. A certified copy shall be kept permanently in the office of the city clerk.
B.
Flood hazard boundary map. The official zoning map is supplemented by an official flood hazard boundary map for the incorporated area of Douglasville. The flood hazard boundary map as hereby adopted consists of a map depicting the 100-year floodplains and identified as the Flood Insurance Ratings Map of the Corps of Engineers, Douglasville, Georgia, as set forth on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk, and data extracted from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reports.
1.
Purpose of flood hazard map. The flood hazard boundary map is intended to give the general location of flood hazard areas. Hydrological studies, engineering computations, flood records, and field surveys compiled and certified by a registered professional engineer may be required.
2.
Correction and amendment of map. As additional engineering and hydrological data including U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reports become available for specific properties or for entire streams which demonstrate to the satisfaction of the community development department that a more exact delineation of the flood hazard boundary lines may be established, the community development director shall propose such corrections to amend the official flood hazard boundary map for adoption by the mayor and city council.
C.
Changes to the official zoning map. No changes of any nature shall be made to the official zoning map except in conformity with amendments to the map approved by the city council or by adoption of a new official zoning map.
D.
Interpretation of boundaries.
1.
The boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map shall be determined based on the legal descriptions associated with approved zoning petitions, or, lacking such legal descriptions, on the basis of the location of the boundary as depicted on the official zoning map along with any dimensions shown.
2.
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
a.
Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundary lines are construed to be the property lines, a line lying in the center of a stream or drainage way, or the city limits of Douglasville.
b.
Where a district boundary line parallels a street, highway or railroad right-of-way but no dimension is given, the distance shall be scaled from the official zoning map.
c.
Where a district boundary line divides a lot that is of single ownership at the time of the effective date of this UDO, the zoning classification of the least restricted portion may be interpreted to extend into the remainder of the lot.
d.
In the event the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the mayor and city council shall, upon application, determine the location of the boundary.
Sec. 1.04. - Temporary suspension of permitting.

Zoning changes requested by a property owner. Upon submission of a valid application for a rezoning or special use approval by an applicant, no permits shall be issued nor, shall any actions be undertaken on the subject property of the application that may be affected by the outcome of such zoning change.
