ARTICLE XV. - MEDIA PRODUCTIONS

Sec. 18-548. - Purpose.
(a)
It is the public policy of the state to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions. The city is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract media productions to the city.
(b)
Despite the many positive benefits media productions may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and the city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit.
( Ord. No. 08-05242021 , § I(18-300), 5-24-2021)
Sec. 18-549. - Scope of coverage.
The permit required by this article shall be required for the creation of all motion picture images generally, creation of still photography images for commercial use, movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, photo shoots, infomercials and public service announcements and all attendant staging, shooting, base camp and similar and related activities and services, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, (the forgoing may be referred to singularly as a "media production activity" or collectively as "media production activities") unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Any media activity production on public property shall require a permit. For purposes of this article, media production activity shall include those areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. For the avoidance of doubt, no public highway, street, road, sidewalk or right-of-way shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this article.
( Ord. No. 08-05242021 , § I(18-301), 5-24-2021)
Sec. 18-550. - Permit requirements.
(a)
Media production activities authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this article are allowed with conditions in all zoning districts. Whenever a permit is sought in connection with media production activities that will be conducted in or near residential neighborhoods, extra consideration shall be given to conditions that may be imposed to ameliorate as much as possible any inconvenience to the residents.
(b)
Two classifications of media production permits are allowed:
(1)
High-impact activities means those activities having an intended duration of 15 or more consecutive days which do not comply with the low-impact standards of this article, and/or will disrupt normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby property and uses. Any filming involving automobile crashes or chases, gunfire, pyrotechnics, explosives, the use of aircraft, stunts, and similar activities are examples of high-impact activities; and
(2)
Low-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of no more than 14 consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses.
(c)
General standards. Prior to making application for a permit, the applicant shall meet with the media production liaison to review locations and the general scope of activities planned during the production.
