ARTICLE IX. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 18-329. - Findings; public purpose; definitions.
(a)
Based on the demonstrated experience of other local governments, including, but not limited to, Peach County, Georgia; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Garden Grove, California, and Houston, Texas, which experience the council has found to be relevant to certain problems that face the city and based on the evidence reviewed by the council prior to the consideration of the ordinance codified in this article, the council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, particularly the problems of crime, blight, and deterioration which are brought about by alcohol and live nudity which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
(b)
Based on a review of the evidentiary materials from other communities referred to above, it is the finding of the council that public nudity (either partial or total) under circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so- called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment" in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions.
(c)
Among the acts of criminal behavior reported to be associated with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public indecency and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the concentration of adult entertainment establishments are depreciation of property values in neighborhoods surrounding nude bars or adult entertainment establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold, increased expenditures for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of adult establishments in particular areas.
(d)
Other negative effects learned about by the council are the apparent connection of these establishments to organized crime and illegal drug sales, the potential spread of communicable diseases to law enforcement personnel who answer calls at adult establishments and to patrons of such establishments, and the potential proliferation of adult entertainment establishments after the initial siting of an adult entertainment establishment in a particular neighborhood.
(e)
The council therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals and preservation of the city's businesses, neighborhoods, churches, schools, and parks to prevent the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the council finds that the prohibition of live nude conduct in establishments licensed to serve alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare by furthering legitimate government interests, such as reducing criminal activity, protection against property devaluation and deterioration, and eliminating undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and allow and/or encourage nudity, and that such prohibition will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.
