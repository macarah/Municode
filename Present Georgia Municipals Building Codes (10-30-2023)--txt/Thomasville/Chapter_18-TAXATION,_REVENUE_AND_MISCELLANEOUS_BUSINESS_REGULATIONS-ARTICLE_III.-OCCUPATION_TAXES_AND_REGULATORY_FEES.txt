In addition to other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, upon any tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, a ten percent penalty as provided by this article shall be levied and the tax and licensing official, shall issue execution for the correct amount of such tax plus applicable penalties against the persons, partnership or corporation liable for such tax which such execution shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person, partnership or corporation liable for such tax, all as provided by the ordinances and charter of such city and the laws of the state. The execution of such occupation tax may become filed on and date from the time when such tax becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the marshal of such city upon the property of defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs.

If at any time after the entry of nulla bono has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest, penalties and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due to the person as though the person had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.
