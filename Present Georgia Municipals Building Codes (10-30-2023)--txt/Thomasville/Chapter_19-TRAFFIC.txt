(e)
Proof that a motor vehicle was operated in disregard or disobedience of the speed limit of the marked school zone shall be evidenced by photographically recorded images.

Prima facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this article was operated in violation of the speed limit of the school zone, together with proof that the defendant was, at the time of such violation, the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle:
(1)
Testifies under oath in open court or submits to the court a sworn notarized statement that the owner of the vehicle was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation; or
(2)
Presents to the court a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation.
(g)

The second notice shall include all information in subsection (d) of this section and shall include a new date of return which shall be no less than 30 days after such mailing as determined and noticed by the law enforcement agency. If such person notified by second notice again fails to pay the civil monetary penalty or file a police report or notarized statement pursuant to subsection (f) of this section by the new date of return, such person shall have waived the right to contest the violation and shall be liable for the civil monetary penalty provided for under section 19-133, except in cases where there is an adjudication that no violation occurred or there is otherwise a lawful determination that no civil monetary penalty shall be imposed. Notices mailed by first class mail pursuant to this article shall be adequate notification of the fees and penalties imposed by this section 19-133. No other notice shall be required for the purposes of this article.
(i)
Any court having jurisdiction over violations of O.C.G.A. § 40-14-18(a), which shall include the municipal court of the city, shall have jurisdiction over cases arising under this article and shall be authorized to impose the civil monetary penalty provided for by this article. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to state law, the provisions of law governing jurisdiction, procedure, defenses, adjudication, appeal, and payment and distribution of penalties otherwise applicable to violations under this article shall apply to enforcement under this article; provided, however, that any appeal from superior or state court shall be by application in the same manner as that provided by O.C.G.A. § 5-6-35.
