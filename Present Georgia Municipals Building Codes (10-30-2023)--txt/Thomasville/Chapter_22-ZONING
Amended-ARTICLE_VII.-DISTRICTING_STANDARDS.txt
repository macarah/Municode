Sec. 22-211. - Standards for commercial buildings.
Architectural styles should be consistent with the character of architectural styles found within the city as listed in the city commercial design guidelines, to the extent deemed applicable by the board of architectural review and zoning appeals. The following architectural standards shall be applied to all new commercial buildings within the city, excluding designated industrial areas, and shall be applied to development and redevelopment:
(1)
Exterior finish material on every facade facing a public right-of-way and 30 percent on the remaining facades shall be limited to stone, brick, stucco, synthetic stucco, pre-cast concrete, clapboard siding, textured block, and wood shingles.
(2)
No blank facades are permitted for all facades facing a public right-of-way. All building facades facing a public right-of-way shall have glazed areas or areas of glazed appearance and openings of at least 20 percent and no more than 75 percent of the facade area. The planning department is authorized to allow a variance up to five percent of the required glazed, glazed appearing, and opening facade area. The glazed, glazed appearance areas and openings shall meet the following requirements:
a.
Storefronts shall be directly accessible from the sidewalk and shall have glazed areas no more than ten feet from the ground, equal to a maximum of 75 percent of its primary facade area.
b.
Windows shall be recessed a minimum of two inches from the exterior face of the facade except when clapboard siding is used on the facade.
c.
Multiple windows in the same rough opening shall be separated by a minimum of a two-inch wide post and sit on one continuous sill.
d.
All visible building facades shall have a typical window. It is recommended that the typical window be rectangular and vertically oriented or square in proportion, but may include side or fan lights. Once a typical window is designated, any window, which is not typical shall be considered an accent window. The primary facade shall have no more than three accent windows. All other visible facades may have up to five accent windows. An accent window may not be larger in area than four times a typical window. Sidelights and fanlights abutting a door shall not be considered as separate windows.
e.
If shutters are used, they shall be sized to match the opening, and be provided for all windows on a given wall.
f.
If security bars are used, they shall be located on the interior of the structure and designed in such a manner so they appear as muntins in a divided light window. Mesh and chainlink are not permitted to cover openings.
(3)
Mechanical systems, backflow preventers, television antennas, satellite dishes and communication devices shall be screened from view by landscaping or built elements designed as an integral part of the building architecture.
(4)
Any building constructed as "new development" or "redevelopment," as that term is defined in section 22-6, is required to have a symmetrical pitched roof with a slope of no less than five to 12. Any building constructed as "new development" or "redevelopment," as that term is defined in section 22-6, which utilizes a barrel tile roof shall have a symmetrical pitch of no less than three to 12. Any building, with the exception of one which utilizes a barrel tile roof, with a roof pitch of less than five to 12, whether new development or redevelopment, shall utilize a parapet or false mansard of no less height than necessary to obscure the roofline from view of the public right-of-way and no more than six feet in height as measured from the bottom of the parapet or mansard or no more than the maximum height as permitted under section 22-210 for the zone in which the building is constructed.
(5)
Architectural details such as texture, pattern, color, and building form used on the front facade should be incorporated on all visible building facades but does not apply to any facade facing service courts or other areas generally not visible to the public.
(6)
In order to avoid cookie cutter style buildings and in recognition of the fact that corporations have available a minimum of two design options, individual corporate image architectural design elements and colors shall be incorporated only as secondary elements to the buildings and not as the dominant element.
(7)
No fencing in any commercial and manufacturing zones shall exceed seven feet in height. A list of approved fencing materials is maintained in the planning department. Chainlink fencing will only be permitted in the rear setbacks and must be coated.
(8)
All awnings shall be consistent with the architecture of the building. Signs displayed on awnings shall comply with the city commercial design guidelines.
(9)
To the fullest extent possible, all utility connections, including, but not limited to, electric and phone shall be placed underground.

Sec. 22-212. - Procedural requirements for approval of permit.
Detailed architectural renderings demonstrating compliance with the architectural standards may be submitted for review along with the site plan checklist and site plans to the planning department. They shall be drawn to a minimum scale of one inch equals 20 feet. If not submitted previously, the applicant shall submit the detailed architectural drawings at the time of submission of the building plans for plan review for building permit approval. No plans shall be accepted without drawings in sufficient detail to allow planning department staff to assess compliance with the architectural standards of this article. No building permit shall be issued until the planning department has determined that the building plans are in compliance with the architectural standards of this article.

Sec. 22-213. - Appeals and variance requests.
It is the intent of the city council that all development and redevelopment shall conform to the standards set forth in this article. If modifications are required, any person, firm, group or organization may apply for relief from the requirements set forth in this article to the board of architectural review and zoning appeals, unless otherwise specified in this article. An appeal of a decision made by the planning department for this article or a request for a variance from these architectural standards can be heard by the board of architectural review and zoning appeals. Any such application shall be accompanied by the necessary information in order for the board of architectural review and zoning appeals to make a determination whether the alternate design proposal meets the intent of the requirements. The board of architectural review and zoning appeals, as part of an approval of the variance request, may include conditions, modifications, or requirements necessary to mitigate the impact of such variance. See article XV for board governance, policy, and procedures.
