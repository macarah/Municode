(Code 1991, § 2-190; Ord. No. 10112004-1 , exh. A(2-190), 10-11-2004)
Sec. 2-226. - Calculation of benefits.
When a member shall retire as a matter of right, the member shall be paid each month thereafter for the rest of the member's life an amount which is calculated as follows:
(1)
For Class A members. Unless they elect to receive benefits available to Class B members as provided in section 2-224(b), the normal retirement benefit for Class A members shall be 1.5 percent of average monthly salary received by the member during the best three consecutive years out of the ten years immediately preceding retirement, multiplied by the member's number of years of employment.
(2)
For Class B and Class C members. For members who retire under section 2-224(c) or (d) the normal retirement benefit shall be calculated by adding the figures obtained from the calculations in this subsection and multiplying the total sum by the number of years of employment:
a.
One percent of average monthly salary received by the member during the best three consecutive years out of the ten years immediately preceding retirement;
b.
Six-tenths of one percent of such average monthly salary in excess of $1,728.78;
c.
Six-tenths of one percent of such average monthly salary, as amended from time-to-time, in excess of $3,989.59.
The salary break points used in these calculations shall be increased or decreased on January 1, 2004, and on every January 1 and July 1 thereafter, based upon the percentage increase or decrease of the average Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for all items (1984 equals 100), or successor to that index, as published by the United States Department of Labor for the respective periods of the preceding November 1 through April 30, and May 1 through October 31. Break point calculations shall be brought to the pension board by the chief financial officer of the city for approval at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
(3)
When a member shall retire under the disability provision of section 2-224, the member shall be entitled to be paid each month, for the duration of disability, a sum computed in the same manner as normal retirement under this section, except that year of service shall be deemed to be the greatest of the following:
a.
The member's years of service at the time of disability;
b.
The years of service that would have accrued to the member had the member worked until age 65 years, but not to exceed 20 years; or
c.
The years of service that would have accrued to the member had the member worked until age 60 years.
If the number of years of service determined in subsections (c)(2) and (3) of this section exceeds the number of the member's years of service at the time of the disability, during such period the member shall be deemed to have received the salary at the time of disability for purposes of computing monthly average salary. If the years of service determined in this subsection exceed the member's years of service at the time of disability, during such period the member shall be deemed to have received the member's last completed year's salary for the time granted due to the member's disablement for purposes of computing the member's average monthly salary.
(4)
It shall be the obligation of the member to supply the pension board with all data on social security necessary under any previous ordinance for the coordination of benefits in accordance with the benefit formula of such previous ordinance. Failure to supply the necessary social security data shall be grounds for withholding payment until the data is supplied.
(5)
When a member retires under the early retirement provisions of section 2-224(e), the member's payments shall be calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit except that years of employment and average monthly salary shall be determined as of the early retirement date. Such benefits shall then be reduced one-half percent for each month the date of early retirement precedes the date of normal retirement. Such reduced benefits, once determined, shall remain constant at the reduced figure for the life of the member.
(6)
Members of the pension plan who were retired and were receiving benefits on December 28, 1976, and those Class A and Class B members who retire after that date, shall be entitled to post-1984 retirement adjustments in their benefits based on the fluctuation in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) as published by the United States Department of Labor. Benefits shall be adjusted by the average Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for all items (1984 equals 100) (or the successor to that index). The benefits shall be adjusted by the cost-of-living adjustment. On January 1, 2004, and July 1 of every calendar year beginning July 1, 2004, on the respective periods of November 1 through April 30 and May 1 through October 31. In no event shall the increase or decrease exceed 1.5 percent for each six-month period. The beginning price index shall be the average price index of the six-month period during which retirement takes place. No adjustment shall reduce the member's benefit below those earned under the standard benefit formula. Notwithstanding anything contained in this plan to the contrary, Class C members are not eligible for the post-retirement adjustments described in this subsection. Break point calculations shall be brought to the pension board by the chief financial officer of the city for approval at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
(7)
A member who retires as a matter of right under section 2-224 or 2-228(c) may elect to have the member's benefits made payable in a reduced amount for life and in a lesser amount thereafter to a surviving spouse for life. Written notice of a survivor annuity of 50 percent or less must be filed upon a form prescribed by the pension board at any time prior to retirement. Written notice of a survivor annuity of more than 50 percent must be filed on a form prescribed by the pension board no earlier than 60 days and no later than 15 days prior to retirement. In the event of such election, the amount of benefits otherwise payable under this plan to the retired member and the amount payable to the surviving spouse shall be determined by the actuarial table in effect at the time of retirement. Such table shall be the latest approved by the city's actuarial consultant and the pension board. A member who has elected this option and has been approved by the board may revoke the member's election by written notice to the board up to the day of the member's retirement. In the event of the death of a spouse prior to the retirement of a member, such an election shall be deemed to be revoked automatically. Upon the date of retirement, the election shall become irrevocable and the retired member's pension shall be in the reduced amount, henceforth, regardless of whether the member's spouse survives the member.
(8)
A member retiring as a matter of right under section 2-224(c) or (e) may elect to have the member's benefits made payable on a levelized basis considering a combination of city pension and social security which is determined to be of equivalent value to the member's accrued benefit using the actuarial assumptions described in this section at the time of retirement. The purpose of this provision is to enable the member to receive, from this pension plan and under social security, an aggregate income in an approximately level amount for life.
(9)
For the purposes of this section, a member's average monthly salary shall be determined exclusive of overtime. Salary shall include merit or other bonuses received for the performance of duties, but salary shall not include special award or incentive payments such as the wellness incentive program, the employee suggestion awards program, and the like.
(10)
The actuarial assumptions shall be defined as follows:
a.
Mortality assumption for a member who is not retiring under the disability provision of section 2-224 shall be the most current annuity mortality table as approved by the city's actuary and as described in the Internal Revenue Service's Revenue Ruling 95-25.
b.
Mortality assumption for a member who is retiring under the disability provision of section 2-224 shall be the most current annuity mortality table as approved by the city's actuary and as described in the Internal Revenue Service's Revenue Ruling 96-7.
c.
Mortality assumption for the spouse of a member shall be the most current annuity mortality table and as approved by the city's actuary as described in the Internal Revenue Service's Revenue Ruling 95-25.
d.
The net investment yield, compounded annually, shall be determined based on actuarial assumptions as calculated annually. The semi-annual cost of living adjustments for Class A and B members shall be calculated, and compounded semiannually, by the city treasurer.
(Code 1991, § 2-191; Ord. No. 10112004-1 , exh. A(2-191), 10-11-2004)
Sec. 2-227. - Death before receiving benefits.
(a)
Should any member of the pension plan, who has ten or more years of membership in the pension fund, die while still in the active employment of the city, the surviving spouse of the member will be entitled to a pension. The amount of pension shall be the equivalent of the benefit calculated at a 100 percent survivor's option. The accrued benefits will be calculated as for normal retirement but will reflect the years of service and average salary at time of death. The benefits, so calculated, shall be payable for the survivor's lifetime or until a member remarries. The survivor who is entitled to benefits under this section may elect to receive a refund of contributions, as covered under subsection (b) of this section, in lieu of a pension if the member so desires.
(b)
Should any member die without actually receiving any cash benefits hereunder and have less than ten years of service in the pension plan or have no surviving spouse entitled to receive benefits under subsection (a) of this section, the amount the member has contributed to the pension plan, plus interest, shall be paid in a lump sum to the member's heirs at law, or to any person designated as beneficiary by such member in writing before the member's death.
(c)
Should a retired member die without having received, in pension benefits, a sum equal to the amount the member has paid into the pension plan plus interest to the date of retirement, and not have a surviving spouse designated to receive a pension, then the difference between the amount paid plus interest and the amount received by the member shall be paid in a lump sum to the member's heirs at law or to any person designated as beneficiary by such member in writing before the member's death.
(d)
Interest will be calculated as follows:
(1)
2.5 percent for the period of time prior to 1971.
(2)
4.0 percent from January 1, 1971, through December 31, 1976.
(3)
5.0 percent from January 1, 1977, through June 30, 2004.
(4)
3.0 percent from July 1, 2004, through December 31, 2004.
(5)
Effective January 1, 2005, interest will be calculated using the applicable federal long-term rate as found in section 1274(d) of the code.
All interest will be compounded annually.
(Code 1991, § 2-192; Ord. No. 10112004-1 , exh. A(2-192), 10-11-2004; Ord. No. 06092008-1 , § II, 6-9-2008)
Sec. 2-228. - Refund of contributions and vested benefits.
(a)
(1)
Any employee leaving the employ of the city before the employee becomes eligible for retirement under the provisions of this division and who has paid assessments to the pension plan for a period of less than ten years of service will be refunded the total amount the employee has paid into the pension plan plus interest from the beginning of the employee's membership in the plan as calculated using the applicable federal long-term rate in effect on the date of the employee's termination of employment. If an employee desires to retire under the disability provisions of section 2-224(f), such employee's refund shall not be made until such time as the Social Security Administration has denied the employee's claim for disability benefits. Such refunds shall be with interest from the beginning of the employee's membership in the plan. Interest will be calculated as provided in section 2-227(d). Upon such refund being made or tendered to such person, there shall be no further liability of any kind upon the city or the pension board of trustees.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (a)(1) of this section to the contrary, a city manager incurring a break-in-service and who has been refunded the total amount the city manager has paid into the pension plan, plus interest, may upon re-employment with the city, remit to the city an actuarially determined amount from the break-in-service until re-entry into the plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term "actuarially determined amount" shall mean that amount as determined by the actuary employed by the city as that amount to be remitted to the city by the city manager to provide a calculated benefit pursuant to section 2-226, as if the city manager had not incurred a break-in-service. The city manager who is re-employed with the city after incurring a break-in-service shall re-enter the plan upon payment of all actuarially determined amounts as if the city manager had not incurred a break-in-service.
(b)
If a terminating employee has completed ten or more years of service, the employee shall have the option of:
(1)
Refund of the total amount the employee has paid into the pension plan plus interest from the beginning of the employee's membership in the plan as calculated in subsection (d) of this section; or
(2)
Retaining a vested interest in the plan unless the employee has been discharged for dishonesty related to the employee's employment.
(c)
If any employee with ten or more years of service does not withdraw the employee's contributions from the pension plan, the employee will be entitled to a vested pension payable at age 60 calculated at 100 percent of the employee's accrued benefits. The accrued benefits at time of separation will be calculated as for normal retirement but will reflect the years of service and average salary up to date of termination, and will reflect break points in effect at time of termination of employment with the city. An employee resigning or discontinuing membership in the plan will have the employee's benefits frozen at of that time of termination.
(d)
If any employee with ten or more years of service who at termination of employment chooses to leave the employee's contributions in the pension plan should at a later date decide to withdraw the employee's contributions, the employee may do so, but interest on these funds as calculated under subsection (d) of this section, will be only to date of termination of employment.
(e)
If any member of the plan is terminated and subsequently re-employed by the city, the member will be treated as a new employee, and the member's prior service to the city will not be recognized in determining the member's years of service in the plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the city manager's employment with the city is terminated and the city manager is subsequently re-employed by the city, the city manager will not be treated as a new employee and the city manager's prior service to the city will be recognized in determining the city manager's years of service, but only if the city manager remits to the city the actuarially determined amount pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section. If the city manager fails to remit to the city the actuarially determined amount pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, then and in that event the city manager will be treated as a new employee and the city manager's prior years of service to the city will not be recognized.
