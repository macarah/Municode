Sec. 3.5.1. - Purpose.
The intent of city council in adopting the mixed-use zoning district and associated standards of this section is to: (1) create destination environments which residents and commuters may choose to frequent for shopping, dining, entertainment and living, (2) capitalize on a growing market trend toward goods and services being available in a walkable setting, (3) focus development on locations served by extensive public infrastructure and (4) avoid the inefficiencies in services delivery associated with sprawl.
