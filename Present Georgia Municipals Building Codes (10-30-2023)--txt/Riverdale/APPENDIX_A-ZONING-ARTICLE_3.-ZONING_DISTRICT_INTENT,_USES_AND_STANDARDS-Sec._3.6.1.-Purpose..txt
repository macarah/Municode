Sec. 3.6.1. - Purpose.
Located just outside Atlanta, the City of Riverdale has long desired to create a town center area to be the focus of development and redevelopment; a walkable community center where residents are able to live, work, and play. The concept of developing a town center was introduced in the early 2000s, with plans becoming a reality when city hall, a community center, an amphitheater and open space, and a public parking deck were completed in 2010.
With these public improvements in place and with renewed growth of the Metro Atlanta area, the city is in a position to promote development within the town center mixed-use (TCMU) district. The TCMU district standards and related architectural and urban design standards seek to encourage the desired mixed-use development necessary to establish a viable town center while maintaining clarity and flexibility in zoning.
