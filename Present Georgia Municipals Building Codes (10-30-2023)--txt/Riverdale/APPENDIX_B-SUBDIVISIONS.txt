ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN

Sec. 6.1. - Suitability of the land.
Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, erosion, or otherwise deemed by the planning commission to be topographically unsuitable for residential use shall not be platted for residential occupancy; nor shall such land be platted for any other uses as may continue such conditions or increase danger to health, safety, life or property unless steps are taken to eliminate the above-mentioned hazards.
Sec. 6.2. - Access.
(6.2.1) Every subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street.
(6.2.2) When land is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
(6.2.3) No subdivision shall be so designated [designed] as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land.
Sec. 6.3. - Conformance to the master plan.
(6.3.1) All proposed subdivision shall conform to the master plan at the time of plat submission to the planning commission.
(6.3.2) In subdivisions related to or affecting any state or federal highway the approval of the State Highway Department of Georgia may be required by the planning commission.
(6.3.3) When features of the master plan such as school sites, parks, collector streets, major streets and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, or when these features have not been anticipated by the master plan but are considered essential by the planning commission, such features shall be reserved by the subdivider. Whenever such reserved land, or any portion thereof, is not required, optioned, or condemned by the appropriate public agency within 90 days from the date of recording the subdivision, the subdivider may claim the original reservation, or portion thereof, and cause it to be subdivided in a manner suitable to the subdivider, subject to the provisions of these regulations.
(6.3.4) The planning commission shall waive the reservation requirements of subsection (6.3.3) whenever the public body responsible for land acquisition executes written release stating that such planned feature is not to be acquired.
(6.3.5) The planning commission shall disapprove any plat when such planned features, as specified by the master plan, are not incorporated in the plat.
(6.3.6) Whenever a plat proposes the dedication of land to public use and the planning commission finds that such land is not required or suitable for public use, the planning commission may either refuse to approve said plat or it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land.
Sec. 6.4. - Zoning and other regulations.
Whenever there is a discrepancy between the minimum standards or dimensions noted in these regulations and those contained in the zoning ordinance or other city regulations, the most restrictive shall apply.
Sec. 6.5. - Street and subdivision names.
The planning commission may refuse to accept street names and subdivision names. Streets that are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets.
Sec. 6.6. - Nonsubdivision developments.
The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of a plan for a development which is not to be subdivided into customary lots, blocks, and streets, when in the judgment of the planning commission, said plan will provide adequate open spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides such covenants or other means as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan. Plans for such developments shall be submitted to and approved by the planning commission whether or not a plat is to be recorded and no building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given. Failure of the planning commission to act on such a plan within 40 days shall be deemed approval, and thereafter a certificate of approval shall be issued to the developer at his request. However, if the planning commission determines that additional time is required to study the plan, an extension of time shall be requested in writing and the developer may agree thereto.

Where it can be shown that adequate strength surface finish, and durability can be obtained on a consistent basis with mix designs other than those specified above, such designs may be used upon written approval. When compressive strength alone is specified, the proportions of cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, water and admixture to be used in the mix shall be determined by an approved testing laboratory or a registered professional engineer, in accordance with the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Standard 318-77, sections 4.2 through 4.8 (excluding section 4.6).
(b)
Concrete placement. Ready-mixed concrete hauled in truck mixers or truck agitators shall be deposited in place within 90 minutes from the time water is added to the mix.
Before placing concrete, freestanding water, snow, ice or other foreign materials shall be removed from subgrade. All forms shall be thoroughly cleaned, secured in position, and coated with a form-release agent.
Concrete shall be placed, struck off, consolidated, and finished to plan grade with a mechanical finishing machine, vibrating screed, or by hand-finishing methods when approved. In lieu of fixed forms, the contractor may place concrete with a slipform paver designed to spread, consolidated, screed, and float finish the freshly placed concrete in one complete pass of the machine.
Concrete thickness shall be minimum of five inches without reinforcement for residential and collector streets. Major thoroughfares and streets serving industrial areas shall be a minimum of seven inches in thickness with properly designed reinforcement.
After placement of the concrete, the pavement thickness should be determined by measurement of cores drilled from the pavement.

Measurements of individual cores should be performed in accordance with ASTM C174.
(c)
Finishing. After concrete has been struck off and consolidated, a bullfloat may be used to remove any high or low spots. Bullfloat use shall be confined to a minimum. A final skid-resistant finish shall be made with a burlap drag or broom.
(d)
Curing and protecting concrete. Concrete shall be cured by protecting it from loss of moisture, rapid temperature change, and mechanical injury for at least three days after placement. After all free water has disappeared from the surface, concrete shall be covered and cured. A liquid membrane-forming compound shall be uniformly sprayed on all exposed surfaces. Rate of application shall be in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Other approved curing materials such as burlap or polyethylene sheeting may be used.
When concrete is being placed in cold weather and the temperature may drop below 35 degrees Fahrenheit, straw, hay, insulated curing blankets, or other suitable material shall be provided along the line of work to prevent freezing of concrete. Concrete injured by frost action shall be removed and replaced at the contractors expense.
In order that the concrete may be protected against the effects of rain before the concrete is sufficiently hardened, the contractor should be required to have available, at all times, materials for the protection of the surface. Such protective materials should consist of burlap or cotton mats, curing paper or plastic sheeting material. When rain appears imminent, all paving operations should stop and all personnel should take the necessary steps for complete protection of the unhardened concrete. No retopping of damaged concrete will be allowed.
(e)
Joints. Unless shown on the project drawings, a jointing location plan shall be prepared by the contractor and approved before paving begins.
Control joints or contracting joints shall be formed by one of the following methods: sawing, forming by hand, forming by premolded filler, or using full-depth construction joints. Joint depth shall be a minimum of one-fourth the slab thickness. Hand-formed joints shall have a maximum edge radius of one-fourth inch. Sawing of joints shall begin as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to permit sawing without excessive raveling. All joints shall be completed before uncontrolled shrinkage/ cracking occurs. Joints shall be continuous across the slab, unless interrupted by full-depth premolded joint filler. Joints shall extend completely through the curb. Joint openings wider than one-fourth inch shall be cleaned and sealed before opening to traffic.
Isolation joints (expansion joints) shall be used to isolate fixed objects abutting or within the paved area. They shall contain premolded joint filler for the full-depth of the slab.
Dowels shall be used at transverse and longitudinal construction joints. The dowels should be plain round bars conforming to ASTM A615, or CSA G30.12. Before delivery to the jobsite at least one-half of each bar should be covered with one coat of lead or tar paint. Dowels should be placed at mid-depth in the slab and should be able to move longitudinally in their slot. Recommended dowel dimensions and spacings are given in the following table:

3 Allowance made for joint openings and for minor error in positioning dowels.
Joint spacing shall be as follows: Longitudinal joint spacing shall not exceed 12.5 feet. Transverse joint spacing should be at regular intervals of 15 feet or less. Longitudinal construction joints should be either keyed (tongue-and-groove) or butt-type with tiebars to hold adjacent slabs in vertical alignment. See Diagram No. 3A for typical joint details. [3]
When approved, the contractor shall be permitted to make minor adjustments in joint location to make them coincide with drainage or other structures.
(f)
Opening to traffic. The pavement shall be closed to passenger-car traffic for at least three full days or until such time that the minimum compressive strength of the concrete is at least 75 degrees of its design strength. Traffic shall be restricted to passenger cars and light trucks for at least seven days after concrete is placed. In all cases approval shall be obtained prior to opening of the pavement to traffic. No traffic should be permitted on the pavement until the joints have been sealed.
The contractor should protect the pavement and its appurtenances against both public traffic and traffic caused by his own employees and agents. Any damage to the pavement, occurring prior to opening to the public, shall be repaired or the pavement replaced, by procedures and methods as approved.
(g)
Inspection and approvals. For each day's placement of concrete at least one set of three cylinders shall be made by the contractor or a testing laboratory. Not less than one set of specimens shall be made for every 500 feet of paving. One of the cylinders shall be tested at the age of seven days, one at the age of 28 days, and one at the discretion of the engineer, to determine the quality of concrete obtained. The costs for performing such tests shall be borne by the contractor.
B.
The pavement of medium-duty streets shall consist of an asphaltic limestone wearing course, black asphalt base and aggregate subbase, as specified herein.
