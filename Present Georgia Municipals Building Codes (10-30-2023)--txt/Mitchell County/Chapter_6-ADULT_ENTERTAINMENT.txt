Chapter 6 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

Sec. 6-1. - Findings; public purpose.
Based on the experience of other local governmental jurisdictions and local public hearings and testimonies recognizing that the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments produces increased criminal activity, dimension of property values and deterioration of adjacent neighborhoods, the county board of commissioners find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the board of commissioners also find that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.
