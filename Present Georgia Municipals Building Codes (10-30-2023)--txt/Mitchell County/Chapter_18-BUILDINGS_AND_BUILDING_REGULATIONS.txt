ARTICLE III. - PLUMBING INSPECTIONS

Sec. 18-149. - Findings.
(a)
The state general assembly enacted legislation during the 1996 session of the legislature (1996 Ga. Laws, page 1632) specifying, among other things, that master plumbers and utility contractors may self-inspect their own installation of water and sewer lines under conditions specified in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-26(d).
(b)
The role of the county inspections office is to ensure that work undertaken by plumbers, utility contractors as well as construction contractors, subcontractors and others in the building trades is done in accordance with properly enacted county building and/or construction codes.
(c)
Water and sewer lines are particularly susceptible to problems resulting from improper installation since they are installed underground and out of view once covered over by the plumber or utility contractor.
(d)
Self-inspection of installations of water and sewer lines is inherently suspect as a conflict of interest.
(e)
The general assembly, while authorizing self-inspection, also recognized that self-inspection may not be in the best interest of any county or the citizens of any county by providing in section 3 of 1996 Ga. Laws, page 1632, that any county may exempt itself from the self-inspection provisions of 1996 Ga. Laws, page 1632, by adoption or enactment of a proper resolution or ordinance.
(f)
In lieu of the self-inspection procedure specified in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-26(d), a county may establish other alternative procedures to allow for self-inspection or independent third-party inspection under conditions more favorable to and protective of the public.
(Code 2004, § 18-61; Ord. of 5-14-1996)
Sec. 18-150. - Exemption.
The board of commissioners, pursuant to section 3 of 1996 Ga. Laws, page 1632, exempts the county from the alternative inspection provisions of O.C.G.A. § 8-2-26(d).
