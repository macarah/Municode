It has been determined by the board of commissioners that there exists an urgent need to develop and promote for the public good and general welfare trade, commerce, industry and employment opportunities within the county.

(c)
The county development authority has acted in carrying out its specified purpose within the limitations and restrictions set forth in the particular amendment to the state constitution which provided for its creation and operation.
(d)
The amendment to article VII, section VII of the state constitution which permits the general assembly of the state to create development authorities for certain purposes and which was ratified at the general election of November 5, 1968, and thereafter duly proclaimed by the governor of the state (1968 Ga.

The Development Authorities Law, as amended, grants broader powers in the area of general industrial development to development authorities created thereunder than are granted under the terms of the constitutional amendment creating the county development authority, and the board of commissioners is desirous of having two authorities in the county which can be used to promote and develop for the public good and welfare trade, commerce, industry and employment opportunities in the county.

Sec. 2-262. - Cash management policy.
Collection, disbursement and deposit of all county funds shall be managed to meet anticipated cash flow needs. The county will strive to maximize the return on its investments, with the primary objective being preserving capital in accordance with the county's ordinances and prudent investment practices. All investments of county funds shall be made through financial institutions located within the county, provided that the rates are reasonably competitive with the state investment pool. The county will encourage competition among the financial institutions for the county's investments and depository accounts. Investments can only be made in money market accounts and certificates of deposit that are federally insured and/or covered by pledged securities.

DIVISION 4. - INVESTMENT POLICY

Sec. 2-280. - Purpose and intent.
There shall be a consistent and uniform process for the investment of county funds not needed for immediate payment obligations. This process will be used so that funds not needed for immediate obligations will be invested in a way that safeguards the principal, provides the liquidity required to meet financial obligations in a timely manner, and, given these two goals, provides the best return on investment.
(Ord. No. 2016-005, § 1(2-259(a)), 4-12-2016)
Sec. 2-281. - Authority.
(a)
The county finance officer, acting on behalf of the county board of commissioners, is designated as the investment officer of the county and is responsible for the investment management decisions and program activities within the limitations established by the board of commissioners. All proposed investment activities are to be submitted to and approved by the county administrator prior to performance of the transaction. No investment transaction may be engaged in except as provided for under the terms of this policy.
(b)
Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4, the county may invest any money within its control (other than bond issue proceeds) in any of the following, in order to achieve the goals of security, liquidity, and return on investment:
(1)
Obligations of this state or of other states;
(2)
Obligations issued by the United States government;
(3)
Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency;
(4)
Obligations of any corporation of the United States government;
(5)
Prime bankers' acceptances;
(6)
The local government investment pool established by O.C.G.A. § 36-83-8;
(7)
Repurchase agreements; and
(8)
Obligations of other political subdivisions of the state.
(Ord. No. 2016-005, § 1(2-259(b)), 4-12-2016)
Sec. 2-282. - Procedures.
(a)
Security. The first and foremost consideration in choosing investments is security. To reduce the risk of loss because of the failure of any financial institution, depositor, broker, or dealer, the county will "pre-qualify" these entities prior to investing funds with them. Qualifications will include, as appropriate, an audited financial statement demonstrating compliance with state and federal capital adequacy guidelines, proof of certification by a recognized association, proof of state registration, and evidence of adequate insurance coverage. The investment portfolio will be diversified in order to reduce the impact of potential loss from any one type of security or individual issuer. Risk of interest loss will be reduced by assuring that security maturity dates coincide with anticipated cash requirements, and by investing operating funds primarily in short-term securities.
(b)
Liquidity. The investments chosen will provide adequate liquidity to meet upcoming cash-flow requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. The investment portfolio will be structured so that investment securities mature concurrent with cash needs. In order to respond to unanticipated cash needs, investments will include securities with good resale markets, such as the local government investment pool.
(c)
Return on investment. While taking care to assure that security and liquidity needs are met, investments will be made in a way that can be expected to produce a reasonable return on investment. Meeting all three of these goals at once will mean that the majority of investments are in relatively low-risk securities, which will earn a fair return relative to the risk assumed. Investments will be diversified by maturity, issuer, and class of security in order to help meet these goals.
