Editor's note— A resolution adopted Mar. 24, 2006, repealed art. II, §§ 4-31—4-49, in its entirety and enacted similar new provisions to read as herein set out. The former §§ 4-31—4-49 derived from a resolution adopted Feb. 26, 1999.

Sec. 4-31. - Statement of findings.
The commissioner finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the overall economic growth of Pickens County as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards & Sign Control available at http://www.scenic.org; Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP, The Public Purpose of Rowell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper (December 7, 1999) available at http://roswellgov.com. In particular, based on the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the commissioner finds that unregulated signs:
(a)
Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians;
(b)
Can be a detriment to the public health;
(c)
Can hamper economic growth;
(d)
Can lower property values;
(e)
Can adversely impact public investments;
(f)
Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and
(g)
Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment.
The commissioner acknowledges that the adverse impact of unregulated signs on the health, safety, welfare, and prosperity of the public as well as the government is a topic of ongoing study and research by various governments, educational institutions, and other public and private organizations. To the extent these studies and research further support the findings contained in this section, the commissioner relies and incorporates by reference said studies and research.

Fee. Each application for a variance shall be accompanied by the applicable fee, which shall be established by the commissioner or his/her designee.

1.
There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area;

The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant;

The variance is not a request to permit a sign that exceeds the height and size limitations contained in this article;
