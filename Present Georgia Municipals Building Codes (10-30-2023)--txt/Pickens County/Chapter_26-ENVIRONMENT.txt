ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Secs. 26-1—26-30. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Sec. 26-31. - Title.
This article shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Pickens County.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 1)
Sec. 26-32. - Purpose and objective.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Pickens County, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be insured. For this reason it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Pickens County relies upon as sources of public water. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to insure that pollution threats are minimized.
(2)
The objectives of this article are:
a.
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
b.
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
c.
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse affect on groundwater quality.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 1)
Sec. 26-33. - Definitions.
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone or rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600-2-87-035. (Note: the DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility).
Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby, replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility map(s) means maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that shows the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the State into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

ARTICLE III. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED REGULATIONS

Sec. 26-61. - Title.
This article shall be known as the Pickens County Water Supply Watershed Ordinance.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 2)
Sec. 26-62. - Purpose.
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Pickens County, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter storm water runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, storm water runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicant, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials results in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
The purpose of the water supply watershed protection overlay regulation is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for Pickens County; also, to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediments to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 2)
Sec. 26-63. - Definitions.
Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances. Specific buffer uses may be approved by the Pickens County Land Development Officer consistent with these criteria.
Corridor means all land within the buffer areas and other setback areas.
Impervious surface means a man-made structure or surface, which prevents the infiltration of storm water into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios.
Perennial stream means a stream, which flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a USGA Quad Map.
Reservoir boundary means the edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level.
Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, storm water systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.
Water supply reservoirs means a governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Water supply watershed means the area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake.

ARTICLE IV. - MOUNTAIN PROTECTION PLAN

Sec. 26-91. - Title.
This article shall be known as the Mountain Protection Plan of Pickens County.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 3)
Sec. 26-92. - Purpose.
The mountains of Georgia are characterized by steep slopes, thin soils, and, because of the natural stresses placed on such environments, they require special protection. Land disturbing potentially threatens the public health, safety, welfare, and economic progress of the state. Such land disturbing activity:
(1)
May endanger the quality of surface water by increasing erosion and stream sedimentation;
(2)
Has the potential to induce landslides;
(3)
Has the potential to adversely affect ground water due to difficulty in providing proper sewage disposal in areas of steep slope and high elevation;
(4)
May damage the habitat for some species of wildlife (both plants and animal); and
(5)
May detract from the mountains' scenic and natural beauty which is vital to the local economy through the recreation and tourism industries.
To protect against these adverse effects, this article is adopted.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 2)
Sec. 26-93. - Applicability.
The mountain protection plan shall apply to any "protected mountain" area in Pickens County. A protected mountain is defined as:
"All land area 2,200 feet or more above mean sea level, that has a percentage slope of 25 percent or greater for at least 500 feet horizontally, and shall include the crests, summits, and ridge tops which lie at elevations higher than any such area."
The crests, summits, and ridge tops of mountains whose flanks meet the criteria for a protected mountain shall also be included within the protected area, even though the slopes of such crests, summits and ridge tops have slopes of less than 25 percent.
On an otherwise protected mountain, areas that are at an evaluation of 2,200 feet or more and have a slope of less than 25 percent, exclusive of valley floors, shall be included within the protected mountain area. For the purposes of this plan, a valley floor is defined as a depression of the earth's surface where the slopes of mountains meet at a lower limit to become nearly level, and including such associated areas at the base or toe of a mountain with a 10:1 (10%) slope or less.
(Res. of 8-6-1999, § 3)

ARTICLE V. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 26-121. - Title.
This article shall be known as the Wetlands Protection Ordinance of Pickens County.
(Res. of 12-29-2000, § 1)
Sec. 26-122. - Purpose and objective.
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Pickens County, it is essential that the quality and well being of wetlands be protected within the county. The wetlands in Pickens County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
(Res. of 12-29-2000, § 1)
Sec. 26-123. - Definitions.
Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for Pickens County, Georgia.
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended.
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

Sec. 26-124. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district.
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Pickens County, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto.
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Pickens County, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Res. of 12-29-2000, § 1)
Sec. 26-125. - Protection criteria.
Requirement for local permit or permission: No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from Pickens County. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the Pickens County Health Department using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
(Res. of 12-29-2000, § 1)
