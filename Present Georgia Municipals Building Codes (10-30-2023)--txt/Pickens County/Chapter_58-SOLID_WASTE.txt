Sec. 58-113. - General procedures for handling scrap tires.
All scrap tires generated in Georgia must be disposed of properly. The proper way to dispose of scrap tires is to make sure that they end up at an approved handling facility. An approved handling facility is any end user, sorter or processor which is approved by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD).
Anyone who ends up with scrap tires is called a scrap tire generator. All scrap tire generators must have a generator identification number issued by the EPD. Anyone who hauls scrap tires for profit must have a scrap tire carrier permit. However, scrap tire generators can haul their own scrap tires to an approved handling facility. In order for anyone to accept scrap tires as an approved handling facility, they must be permitted by EPD.
The Environmental Protection Division has developed a procedure for tracking the scrap tires from the generator until they end up at the proper handling facility. A three-part document, called a manifest, is used to verify that the scrap tires are handled correctly. The scrap tire generator fills out part I of the manifest. It is important that the generator list the amount and eventual destination of the tires. The carrier is to fill out part II of the manifest and sign it before the scrap tires are hauled away. The carrier then takes the tires to an approved handling facility which is responsible for filling out part III of the manifest. The completed manifest must then be returned to the generator within 30 days. It is the responsibility of the generator to make sure that the manifest is returned within the required time period. Most of the approved handling facilities have their own scrap tire carriers. In this case, the carrier can sign both part II and part III of the manifest and leave it with the generator. The generator is required to keep the manifest on location where it is available for inspection for a time period of three years.
The responsibility for keeping up with this procedure has been placed on the generator. Therefore, it is the generators responsibility to make sure that the carrier is permitted, that the carrier fills out part II of the manifest and that the manifest is returned within 30 days. If the above procedure has been followed correctly, we can be assured that the scrap tires are properly disposed of and no one will be in violation of the law.
