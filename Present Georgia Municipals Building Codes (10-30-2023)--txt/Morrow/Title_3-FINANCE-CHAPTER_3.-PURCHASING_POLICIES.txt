Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-09 , § 1(Exh. A), adopted June 12, 2018, repealed the former Ch. 3, §§ 3-3-1—3-3-14, and enacted a new chapter as set out herein. The former Ch. 3 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2010-16, adopted Feb. 9, 2010.

Sec. 3-3-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to state the City of Morrow's position regarding the purchasing responsibility and authority of non-construction goods and services. This chapter clarifies purchasing functions and outlines purchasing policies, as well as describes departmental relationships, responsibilities and participation in the procurement cycle. Additionally, the purpose of this chapter is to provide control functions, assure proper record keeping and confirm purchases in writing to allow the city to meet the following goals:
(1)
Maintain at all times and under all conditions a continuous supply of goods and services necessary for the operation of the city;
(2)
Encourage and promote fair and equal opportunity for all persons doing, or seeking to do, business with the city;
(3)
Safeguard the quality and integrity of the city's procurement process;
(4)
Ensure compliance with laws and regulations pertaining to the procurement of goods and services;
(5)
Manage procurement and inventories of purchased goods to meet the use requirements of city departments at the most advantageous cost to the city;
(6)
Administer procurement contracts and contract amendments;
(7)
Properly dispose of all material and equipment declared to be surplus or obsolete; and
(8)
Ensure the city provides quality service to its citizens and supports its businesses by planning in a careful and thoughtful manner.
The philosophy behind this policy is one of separating the need for goods and services from the function of negotiation and executing the necessary contractual purchase agreement.

Sec. 3-3-6. - Competitive procurements.
(a)
Request for informal written quotes (IWQ). Requests for informal written quotes (IWQ) are prepared and issued with the goal of obtaining competitive responses.
Public notice shall be posted on the purchasing agent's internet web page for an IWQ in which the value is expected to exceed $50,000. Additional public notice may be provided for solicitations that, in the sole discretion of the City, are of the size, type, or dollar value that make additional public notice appropriate.
Quotations are to be opened by the purchasing agent at the location indicated and on or after the date indicated in the request for an IWQ. A split or partial quotation may be awarded, if a request for an IWQ is for multiple goods or services, more than one vendor provides a quotation that meets the specifications for the item, and a price comparison can be made between the items quoted. The award may be split between more than one vendor by awarding to the lowest cost provider of each item or reasonable grouping of items if acquisition, delivery, and other requirements can be reasonably administered. A split or partial quotation award shall not be used under the following conditions:
(1)
When the solicitation is for an integrated system and the split of the award between components or parts of that system would jeopardize performance; or
(2)
If the item is part of a system and the performance of that system would be jeopardized if another brand is substituted.
(b)
Request for bids. Requests to bid (RFB) are prepared and issued to prospective bidders, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses.
Public notice (such as publication in a newspaper of general circulation or posting on the purchasing agent's internet web page) of the RFB must be given a minimum of 14 calendar days prior to the date set for bid opening, unless it can be demonstrated that an urgent requirement for goods or services exists, in which instance, the requirement for public notice may be reduced by the purchasing agent. Additional public notice may be provided, at the sole discretion of the city, by publication on the Georgia Municipal Association Marketplace website or through any other advertising opportunities identified by the city.
Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the RFB. All relevant information, including each bid amount and bidder's name, will be recorded on a summary sheet.
Split or partial bid awards may be awarded with the same guidelines and restrictions as those provided for split or partial quotation awards.
A designated employee or agent will make a recommendation to the council for the selection of the best and most responsive bid.
Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids is permitted in accordance with the terms indicated within the RFB. The city, in its sole discretion may waive any irregularity in an erroneous bid and consider such bid.
Late bids will be rejected and will not be returned.
Bids shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth in the RFB, which may include criteria to determine acceptability of goods (for example, inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose). Criteria for the acceptability of goods shall be used to determine whether particular goods are responsive to the RFB, and not to determine the relative desirability between acceptable goods. The city reserves the right to waive any informalities or irregularities of bids, to request clarification of information submitted in any bid, to further negotiate with the responsive and responsible bidder selected for contract award, or to reject any or all bids for any reason whatsoever.
If no bid is received from any responsible and responsive bidder or all bids are rejected, the city shall go through the bid process a second time. If at the conclusion of the second bid process, the city receives no bids or no bid from any responsible and responsive bidder, the city may procure such goods and services by direct negotiation as indicated below in non-competitive procurement of goods and services.
The bid will be awarded, if an award is made, to the most responsible and responsive bidder offering an acceptable price whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the RFB. The bid may require a contract.
(c)
Request for proposals (RFP). When the purchasing agent determines the use of a request for bid is not practical or not advantageous because of existing market conditions or the type of items required, the city may procure goods, services, or professional services through receipt of competitive sealed proposals. Competitive sealed proposals are solicited through the use of an RFP, with the goal of obtaining competitive responses.
Public notice of the RFP shall be given in the same manner as set forth in subsection (b) of this section regarding an RFB.
Proposals shall be opened publicly by the purchasing agent, in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the RFP. A register of proposals shall be prepared that lists each proposer's name.

The proposer shall designate in the smallest increments possible, that part of any qualification which it deems to be proprietary. Proposals and all related correspondence are governed by the Georgia Open Records Act and shall be provided to anyone properly requesting same, after contract award. The city shall have no obligation to protect proprietary data submitted in vendor proposals unless provided for under the Open Records Act and clearly marked as proprietary by the proposer. In the event the proposer deems certain information to be exempt from the disclosure requirements, the proposal must specify what content is considered exempt and cite the applicable provision of the law to support that assessment. In the event such information is requested under the Open Records Act, the proposer's assessment will be examined by the city attorney who will make a determination as to the applicability of that law. The decision to withhold or release the information will be at the city's sole discretion.
Late proposals will be rejected and will not be returned.

The RFP shall contain the basis on which the award is to be made.
If no proposals or no responsive and responsible proposals are received or all proposals are rejected, the city shall go through the RFP process a second time.

The city shall attempt to negotiate a fee with the selected firm. If no agreement is reached, the city shall begin negotiations with the second selected firm. Negotiations will proceed in this manner until an agreement is reached.
