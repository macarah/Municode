Determination and authorization. The city manager, designee, or authorized agent acting on behalf of the city, such as a third party billing agency, shall determine the total assessable costs and shall, in consultation with other city personnel or agents involved in the services, determine whether to assess any, all or part of such costs against any of the responsible parties. In making such determination, the following shall be considered: the extent to which the personnel and equipment of the city or other assisting public entities were involved, including active and standby status; the extent to which an act or omission of a responsible party was a proximate cause for the need for emergency services; and the ability of a responsible party to pay the total assessable costs.
In determining the assessable costs against a party, the city manager, designee, or other authorized agent may rely on a report of services and the actual expenses incurred as prepared by department personnel and/or agents involved in responding to the incident and the amounts as set forth in the cost recovery schedule.
Assessable costs may be allocated among and between responsible parties, including allocating all or some of such costs, jointly and severally, against more than one responsible party.
If a determination is made not to assess all or a part of assessable costs against a responsible party, such determination shall not in any way limit or alter any liability a responsible party may have to other responsible parties.

Billing and collection of assessable costs.

The invoice will be derived from the current cost recovery schedule fees (attachment A, attached to the ordinance from which this section derived). The invoice shall demand full payment within 30 days of billing. Any amount due that remains unpaid 30 days after the date of billing shall have imposed a late charge thereon at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, until paid in full.
The invoice shall be served on the responsible party or the responsible party's insurance company by first class mail, registered mail or personal service.

The invoice shall advise the responsible party or responsible party's insurance company of the right to appeal and the time limits for doing so as provided in subsection (h) of this section. If a responsible party or responsible party's insurance company shall appeal assessable costs pursuant to subsection (h) hereof, such costs, if upheld, in whole or in part, shall be due and payable 30 days from the date of determination of the appeal and any late payment fees shall apply thereafter.
Any failure by a responsible party or responsible party's insurance company to pay an invoice within the time limits provided in this section shall be considered a default in payment. The city, upon approval by city council, may commence legal proceedings to collect defaulted sums owed to the city by a responsible party. In addition, the city, upon approval by city council, may pursue legal action to recover reimbursement for additional costs, fees, expenses, and any other remedy allowable by law, from the responsible party, incurred due to the default in payment of the invoice for assessable costs.
(h)
Appeal procedures. Any responsible party or the responsible party's insurance company who receives an invoice for assessable costs shall have an opportunity to meet with the city manager or designee to request a modification of the assessable costs. The responsible party or the responsible party's insurance company, the recipient of the invoice of assessable costs, must request such meeting in writing within 14 calendar days from the date of service of the invoice.
If after meeting with the city manager or designee, the responsible party is still not satisfied, the responsible party may request an opportunity to appear before the city council to request a modification of the assessable costs. A responsible party who desires to appear before the city council must first meet with the city manager or designee, as provided above, and shall file a written request to appear before the city council with the city clerk within seven calendar days of the date of the meeting with the city manager. Any such request shall specifically identify and explain all reasons why the responsible party believes the assessed costs should be modified. The city council shall only consider the written statements, reasons, basis, or arguments for modification of assessable cost stated in the responsible party's written request to appear. Any reason, basis or argument for modification of the assessable costs not set forth in the written request to appear shall be deemed waived by the responsible party.
