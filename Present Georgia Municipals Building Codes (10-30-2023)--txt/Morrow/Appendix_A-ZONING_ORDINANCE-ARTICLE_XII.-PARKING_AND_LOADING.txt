ARTICLE XII. - PARKING AND LOADING

Section 1201 - Off-street parking and loading spaces required.
It is the intent of this ordinance that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are in fact readily usable for such purposes.
Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure in excess of 200 square feet shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition. No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein.
Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be required. Existing uses providing off-street parking shall have 12 months from date of adoption of this ordinance to comply with handicapped parking requirements. New uses providing off-street parking shall incorporate handicapped spaces into the design of parking facilities.
In any single-family dwelling, duplex or apartment district, the parking of trucks (over one-half ton) or buses shall not be permitted.
(Ord. No. 2009-06, § 19, 5-26-09)
Section 1202 - Design standards.
The following are the design requirements for off-street parking spaces and driveways:
1.
Required dimensions for each parking space. Each full-size automobile parking space shall be not less than nine feet wide and 18 feet in length. Parking spaces for compact and sub-compact cars shall not be less than eight feet wide and 16 feet in length. Adequate interior driveways shall connect each parking space with a public right-of-way.
2.
Interior driveways. Where 90-degree parking is utilized, all interior driveways shall be a minimum of 23 feet in width. If 45 degree or 60 degree angle parking is used then interior driveways shall be at least 12 feet in width for one-way traffic and 20 feet in width for two-way traffic. In the instance where parallel parking is utilized or there is no parking, interior driveways shall be a minimum of ten feet in width for one-way traffic and 20 feet in width for two-way traffic.
3.
Surfacing, drainage and lighting. All off-street parking spaces, access and interior driveways shall be provided with a paved, dust free surface. If the off-street parking facilities are used at night, they shall be properly illuminated for the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and for security. The lighting shall be designed so as not to reflect onto or cause glare in any adjacent residential district.
4.
Sharing of required off-street parking spaces. One-half of the off-street parking spaces required by a use whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be shared with a use that will be closed at night or on Sundays. Parking requirements for two or more uses of the same or different types may be satisfied by the allocation of a common or collective parking facility. This facility shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the individual uses computed separately in accordance with the requirements of the zoning district. The combined parking requirements for two or more uses participating in a cooperative parking arrangement may be partially reduced by the city manager or their representative, provided that the uses will not conflict in time of operation or need for the parking spaces and provided that the parking needs of each use at a given time of day may be adequately met through the parking arrangements.
5.
Handicapped spaces. Parking spaces for the handicapped must be provided in accordance with the guidelines of the Americans With Disabilities Act and federal and state laws.
6.
Compact and sub-compact car spaces. These spaces shall be identified by pavement markings and by appropriate signage.
7.
[Bus stop spaces.] Where a use is located within 300 feet of a bus stop on an existing city bus stop within the specified area, the number of parking spaces required for such use shall be reduced by four spaces for uses located within the Southlake Mall Ring road corridor.
The following are the design requirements for off-street loading stalls:
1.
Required dimensions for each loading stall. Each loading shall be a minimum of ten feet wide and 30 feet in length except that for wholesale and industrial use loading stalls shall be a minimum of 15 feet wide and 60 feet in length.
2.
Access. All off-street loading stalls shall have access from an alley, or if there is no alley, from a public street.
3.
Surfacing, drainage and lighting. All off-street loading stalls and access shall be provided with a paved, dust free surface. If loading stalls are to be used at night, they shall be properly illuminated for the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and for security. Lighting shall be designed to preclude light spill onto adjacent properties.
Design requirements for residential developments, whether single-family residences or multifamily residences, with the exception of property located in an AG agricultural zoning district, shall be as required by Section 902A.

Section 1203 - Minimum offstreet parking and loading requirements.
The following are the minimum number of off-street parking spaces and loading stalls required by type of permitted uses. Twenty percent of the total required parking spaces may be set aside for compact and sub-compact cars. In places of assembly, 20 percent of the total required parking spaces must be set aside for compact and sub-compact cars. For any use not listed, the planning and zoning board shall determine the proper requirements by classifying the proposed use among the uses specified herein so as to assure equal treatment follows the principles set forth. In making any such determination, the planning and zoning board shall follow the principles set forth at the beginning of this article.
