(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-3. - Limitation of liability for code enforcement; no special duty created.
It is the intent of this chapter to protect the public health, life safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the City of Morrow in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that such property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
ARTICLE B. - PERMIT PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 8-2-4. - Permits.
(a)
Required. No person, firm or corporation shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, convert or demolish any building or structure within the city, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a permit for such building or structure from the building official. Separate permits are required for grading, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and low-voltage. However, a homeowner is exempted from obtaining a building permit for remodeling and/or improving his or her dwelling or property as long as the cost of the construction materials does not exceed $1,000.00, and the work is begun and completed solely by the homeowner. This exemption applies only to nonstructural changes (refer to the definition of "Structure" in the city zoning ordinance) and does not apply to any activity which changes the square footage of a structure.
(b)
Fees. Permit fees shall be established in accordance with a schedule approved by the mayor and council, as may be revised from time to time.
(c)
Term. Permits shall generally be good for six months from date of issuance; provided, that if the work is not completed within the initial permit term, but has been diligently pursued, the permit may be extended, without additional charge, for successive three-month terms, so long as the work continues to be diligently prosecuted.
(d)
Revocation for suspension or abandonment. If work authorized by a permit is suspended or abandoned, after the initial term, for a period of 30 days, without good cause shown to the building official, the permit may be revoked upon written notification to the permit holder. Revocations of permits for abandonment are not appealable to the mayor and council.
(e)
State licensing required. No person shall engage in electrical, plumbing, mechanical, or low-voltage contracting on any work within the city unless licensed by the State of Georgia. Where a state license is required, every applicant for a permit shall furnish proof, at time of application, that he or the person contracted to do the work holds a valid state license in good standing. Failure to meet this requirement may be grounds for revocation of the permit.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98; Ord. No. 2000-13, § 1(B), 10-10-00)
Sec. 8-2-5. - Written documentation; payment of fee required for issuance.
Prior to issuance of any permit, in addition to the information requested on the permit application, the building official may require tests, plans and specifications, plats, and other written documentation from engineers, architects, surveyors, and other professionals to assure that full compliance with all permitting requirements of the state minimum standard codes and applicable laws have been met. No permits shall issue on any project where the structure to be built or improved thereon is a "special hazard structure" or the use to be conducted therein is a "special hazard use," without first obtaining the approval of building plans by the state fire marshal's office. Where a project is subject to permitting under the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Law, no permit shall issue for any land-disturbance activity unless approved plans are received from the district soil conservation office and all required stabilization facilities are in place, and ready for inspection. All buildings and structures intended for human occupancy shall have a safe source of drinking water and sanitary disposal; no permit shall issue for any building or structure which does not have access to public water and sewer unless plans for a well and/or septic tank have been approved by the county health department. All permits shall be conditioned upon the application and supporting data, which is deemed incorporated into and made a material part or term of the permission granted. No permit shall issue until all requisite fees have been paid in full.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-6. - Cessation of work.
Upon notice from the building official, work on any building, structure, system or component therein, that is being done contrary to the provisions of the state minimum standard codes, or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, or in violation of any other applicable law, rule, or regulation, shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be given in writing, directed to the owner of the property and to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency situation exists, the building official shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-7. - Revocation of permit for false statement or misrepresentation.
The building official may revoke a permit or approval issued under the provisions of this chapter in the event he finds there has been a false statement or misrepresentation as to any material fact in the application or plans on which the permit or approval was based. The building official may also revoke a permit upon determining that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, or demolition of the building or structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of state minimum standard codes; provided, the work was stopped in accordance with section 8-2-6 and the permittee has not met the conditions for resuming the work after a reasonable period for compliance has been granted.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-8. - Inspections; right of entry.
Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of the state minimum standard codes, or whenever the building official has probable cause to believe that there exists in any building or structure or upon any premises within the city any condition or code violation which makes such building, structure, or premises, unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the building official, or his designee(s), may enter such building, structure, or premises, at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed by this chapter; provided, if such building, structure, or premises is occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and request entry from the building's owner or occupant. If such building, structure or premises is unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or person having charge or control of the building, structure or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the building official may apply to the judge of the municipal court for an administrative search warrant.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-9. - Service of orders.
All decisions, orders and rulings of the building official shall be in writing and served upon the applicant, permit holder, owner of property affected or his agent, and, if applicable, persons in possession or occupancy of affected premises. Where such decisions cannot be personally served, service shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last known address as shown on official government records. Any party aggrieved by a decision, order or ruling of the building official may appeal such decision to the mayor and council by filing a written notice of appeal, within 30 days, with the city clerk; provided, however, in any case where the building official has issued an order for the repair, closing or vacating of a building or structure on grounds it is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous so as to constitute a public nuisance, no appeal shall be taken and the aggrieved party will be summoned to appear for hearing before the municipal court. A ruling by the mayor and council shall be deemed final.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-10. - Variances.
In those limited cases where the state minimum standard codes allow a local variance based upon hardship, the mayor and council may, upon finding that strict enforcement of the state minimum standard codes would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of such codes and the public interest, grant a variance, subject to finding, in writing, all of the following:
(1)
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure, or system involved and which are not applicable to others similarly situated;
(2)
That the special condition and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant;
(3)
That granting a variance will not confer on the applicant any special privileges that are denied by the codes to other buildings, structures, or service systems;
(4)
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure, or service system; and
(5)
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of such codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
In granting a variance, the mayor and council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes, including a reasonable time limit in which the variance is required to be commenced or completed, or both. Each decision of the mayor and council shall recite the factual findings underlying its decision and the reasons for such decision. A copy of the mayor and council's written decision shall immediately be filed in its minutes of the hearing at which the variance was considered and a copy promptly served upon all affected parties. Decisions of the mayor and council shall be final, subject to all applicable remedies afforded by law or in equity.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-11. - Penalty for violation.
Any person, firm, corporation or agent who shall violate any provision of the state minimum standard codes, or the permissive codes and construction standards adopted by this chapter, or fails to comply therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, or who shall erect, construct, alter, install, demolish or move any building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system, or has erected, constructed, altered, repaired, moved or demolished any building, structure, or system therein in violation of this chapter shall be cited to appear before the municipal court. Upon trial, if convicted, such violation shall carry a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per day. Each and every day, or portion thereof, during which any violation of this chapter is committed or continued shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. Violations of this chapter are hereby further declared to be public nuisances, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare; and, in addition to all other remedies provided by law, are subject to abatement or injunction in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
(Ord. No. 98-02, § 1, 6-23-98)
Sec. 8-2-12. - Definition of terms.

If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order:
(1)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factors in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A.

Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.

The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(e)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(f)
The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
(g)
The lien provided for in subsection (f) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court in Clayton County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48, O.C.G.A.; provided, however, that the limitation of Code Section 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. Thirty (30) days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(h)
The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien.
(i)
The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(j)
Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. Code Section 5-3-29.
