(a)
Following the adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived, there shall be no more than three massage therapy businesses per 10,000 persons living within the City limits based on the most current United States Census and calculated on a pro-rata basis. Further, there shall be a 150-foot buffer from any massage therapy business to any residentially zoned property from the front door of the structure where massage business occurs to the nearest parcel boundary line of any residentially zoned property as measured by a straight line on the ground.

(d)
The City Council recognizes that upon the adoption and effective date of the ordinance from which this division is derived, there appear to be active massage therapy businesses with physical facilities in existence in the City limits. Without waiving any illegality of such physically existing structures based on zoning or other laws and without de facto or specifically granting any "grandfathered," "vested," or "legal non-conforming" (as those terms are defined in State Zoning Law) status by virtue of adoption of this purely regulatory section, it is the intention of the City Council to allow the continued operation of the existing massage therapy businesses, provided that the same otherwise comply with all other applicable laws and regulations of the City and State.
(e)
Any licensed massage therapy businesses legally operating prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived shall be exempt from the distance and population cap regulations of this division until the licensee of such massage therapy business or a new licensee to whom the license is legally transferred as provided for by section 12-331 no longer holds a valid massage therapy license from the City of Lawrenceville.
