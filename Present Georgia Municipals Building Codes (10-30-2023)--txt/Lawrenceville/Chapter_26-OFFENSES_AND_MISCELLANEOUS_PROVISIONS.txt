(b)
The Mayor and City Council find and declare that it is the right of every person to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. The Mayor and City Council are determined to stop the property damage to private property that is being inflicted by the planned criminal activities of gangs. It is not the intent of this article to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association.

The Mayor and City Council, however, further find that the City of Lawrenceville and its citizens are being adversely impacted by violent and destructive criminal gangs whose members threaten, terrorize, and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities, both individually and collectively, present a clear and present danger to public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected.
(2)
The Mayor and City Council find that there are criminal gangs operating in the City and that the number of gang-related crimes is increasing. It is the intent of the Mayor and City Council in enacting this article to seek the eradication of criminal activity by gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of gangs which together are the chief source of terror created by street gangs.
(3)
The Mayor and City Council further find that an effective means of punishing and deterring the criminal activities of gangs is through forfeiture of the profits, proceeds, and instrumentalities acquired, accumulated, or used by gangs.
