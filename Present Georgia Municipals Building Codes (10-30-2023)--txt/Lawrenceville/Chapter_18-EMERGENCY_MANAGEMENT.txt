(6)
To temporarily suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conducting county business, or any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation of any city agency, if strict compliance with such ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, efforts shall be made to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension;

Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the Governor or mayor, the city may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the city as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e).

(d)
Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor or mayor, the city council may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the city, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations.
(e)
Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor or mayor, the city council or its designees may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of any areas impacted by the disaster or emergency.

The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the city on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation. The temporary reduction or suspension of fees under this section in no way suspends or exempts the related inspections related to any required permit.
(f)
Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor or mayor, the city council or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by zoning ordinance or development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and planning department. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of a continuing hardship, and in the discretion of the city council or its designees, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months.
