This chapter, including the official zoning map, may be amended as follow:
(1)
By the city council upon its own motion, in accordance with the requirements of the Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq.) and this chapter;

Sec. 28-495. - Zoning procedures.
(a)
Initiation of amendments.
(1)
Applications to amend this chapter may be in the form of proposals to amend the text or proposals to amend the official zoning map. No amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been initiated by either the city council, the planning commission, the property owner, or an individual who has the owner's power of attorney authorizing him to act.
(2)
All proposed amendments shall be initiated by an application on forms provided by the zoning administrator. A standard fee shall be paid with the application in the amount of the advertising costs for the required public hearing.

Shall be limited to one proposed zone district classification.
All applications for an amendment affecting the same property shall not be submitted more often than once every 12 months; however, this provision shall not apply to those properties affected by an amendment filed by the city government or planning commission. Upon good cause shown, the city council may direct the consideration by the planning commission of an application for a map amendment by the owner of property within the zoning jurisdiction of the county, or the authorized agent of such owner notwithstanding that the application pertains to property for which an amendment was submitted within the 12 months next preceding that application, upon payment by the applicant of the application fee again and upon notice requirement being met again.

(g)
Public notification. Public notification of the hearing on a proposed amendment to this chapter shall be given as follows:
(1)

The zoning administrator shall notify the applicant of the date, time and place of the public hearing by mail to the address indicated on the application, which shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the public hearing. Receipt of such letter by the applicant or his agents named in the application shall constitute notice to be present and present a case.
(4)
Public participation plan.
a.
Purpose. The public participation plan is required with most applications for an amendment (rezoning) to the official zoning map. For exceptions to this see subsection (5)c of this section, submittal requirements.
b.
Background: The rezoning process, by nature, often creates a contentious atmosphere for all parties involved. This is primarily because of a lack of meaningful interaction between the parties. This, therefore, creates an information void leading to a misunderstanding of the issues at hand among the involved parties.
c.
Goals of the plan: In light of the above observations, the public participation plan is designed to facilitate on-going communication among the applicants and proponents of the rezoning proposals, the nearby and adjoining property owners, interested citizens, elected officials, and staff throughout the application review process. Specifically, the plan is aimed at ensuring the following:
1.
The nearby and adjoining property owners and interested citizens have adequate opportunity to learn about applications that may affect them and to work with applicants to resolve concerns at an early stage of the process.
2.
Applicants pursue early and effective citizen participation in conjunction with their applications, giving them the opportunity to understand and try to mitigate any real or perceived impacts the applications may have on the community.
The proposed plan is not intended to produce complete consensus on all applications, but to encourage applicants to be good neighbors and to foster an atmosphere for informed decision-making.
d.
Contents of the plan: At a minimum, the public participation plan shall include the following information:
1.
Which property owners, interested parties, political jurisdictions and public agencies may be affected by the application.
2.
How those interested in and potentially impacted by an application will be notified that an application has been made.
3.
How those interested and potentially impacted parties will be informed of the substance of the development proposed by the applicant.
4.
How those potentially impacted and interested parties will be afforded an opportunity to discuss the applicant's proposal with the applicant and express any concerns, issues, or problems that they may have with the proposal, in advance of the public hearing.
5.
The applicant's schedule for completion of the public participation plan process.
6.
Minimum public notification target area. The minimum public notification target area for the public participation meeting will include:
(i)
All properties that are within 750 feet of the legal boundary of the subject property.
(ii)
Any homeowners associations, which represent subdivisions or properties, that fall within the 750-foot boundary.
(iii)
Other interested parties who have requested that they be placed on the interested parties notification list, to be maintained by the planning and zoning office.
These requirements will apply, in addition to the formal notification provisions typically undertaken by the county or city. The basis for this target area is to provide an expanded notification area beyond the legal notification required for rezoning requests (adjacent properties) to enhance public participation opportunities.
(5)
Public participation meeting and report. It is mandatory for the rezoning applicant to schedule and hold a public participation meeting. The public notification letter sent shall identify the date, time, and place of the meeting. In order to formalize the public participation plan process, the applicant shall provide a written report on the results of the public participation meeting to the planning and zoning office one week prior to the planning commission work session. This report will be attached to the planning and zoning office's technical staff report, which is prepared for each rezoning case and is sent to the planning commission and city council. At a minimum, the public participation report shall include the following information:
a.
Details of methods the applicant used to involve the public, including:
1.
Date and location of the meeting held with citizens to discuss the applicant's proposal;
2.
Content, dates mailed and numbers of mailings, including letters, meeting notices, newsletters and other publications;
3.
Where property owners and interested parties receiving notices or other written materials are located; and
4.
The number of people that participated in the process.
b.
A summary of concerns, issues and problems expressed during the process, including:
1.
The substance of the concerns, issues and problems;
2.
How the applicant has addressed or intends to address concerns, issues, and problems expressed during the process; and
3.
Concerns, issues and problems the applicant is unable or unwilling to address and why.
c.
Submittal requirements:
1.
The public participation plan shall be required for all rezoning applications that require the submittal of a site plan. This includes all office, commercial, multifamily residential, and single-family residential rezoning requests that consist of five or more lots. (This excludes rezone requests to R-80 and R-40 for minor subdivisions of two to four lots that do not create new public streets.)
2.
The applicant will be required to submit a certificate of mailing for those property owners within the public notification target area.
3.
The applicant may submit a public participation plan and begin implementation prior to formal application at his discretion; however, implementation shall not begin prior to a preapplication meeting and consultation with the staff of the planning and zoning office.
d.
Meeting requirements and protocol:
1.
The applicant or authorized representative shall be available to answer questions of the general public for at least 30 minutes.
2.
The meeting location shall be held at a public facility within the community for which the applicant is seeking the rezoning request.
3.
The meeting shall not begin prior to 6:30 p.m. on the evening the meeting is to be held.
4.
The applicant or authorized representative shall provide the following material for the general public to view:
(i)
Future land use map.
(ii)
Site plan proposed on application.
(iii)
Contact information (name and phone number and/or e-mail address) for the applicant or authorized representative.
(iv)
Procedure and contact information provided by planning and zoning department.
5.
Notice of the actual meeting shall be submitted to the planning and zoning department to be kept in the rezoning file.
(6)
Conclusion. These are just minimum requirements, prepared in the hope that applicants will reach out further. This plan is not put in place to ensure that the citizens' needs or demands are met entirely. The plan does, however, envision an interactive process whereby applicants and citizens treat each other honestly, fairly and with respect and defuse the contentious nature of the rezoning process. Emerging out of the process should be a better understanding of the issues, and therefor, an atmosphere for informed decision-making.
(h)
Public notification of city-initiated rezoning. The planning commission, of its own motion or at the request of the city council, or the city council may hold public hearings on the proposal of the zoning administrator.
(1)
Upon the decision by the planning commission to hold public hearings, the zoning administrator shall prepare and cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city for at least 15 days but not more than 45 days before the hearing date, a notice of public hearing, such notice to contain a summary of the proposals to be considered by the planning commission, and the date, time, and place of such hearing.
(2)
Copies of the proposal, this chapter, and zoning maps, plus the zoning administrator's evaluation of any proposed district boundary changes, shall be available for public inspection in the planning and zoning department during normal working hours between the date of the first appearance of the notice of the public hearing and the time of such hearing.
(3)
A public hearing on any proposed amendment to this chapter properly initiated shall be held before the municipal planning commission, which is delegated the duty to conduct such public hearing as is required by The Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq.). A public hearing on any proposed amendment to this chapter properly initiated shall be conducted at the time and place specified by the planning commission and as set forth in the public notification described in this subsection (h). The purpose of such hearing shall be to present to the public the proposed zoning amendment and to receive comments thereon from the public. The planning commission shall consider the proceedings and comments of such hearing in making its recommendation to the city council as to any zoning decision on the proposed zoning amendment. The planning commission shall prescribe the rules of order for its deliberations on matters with which it is charged to advise the city council under this chapter and said rules of order shall be consistent with the general requirements and purposes set forth in this article and other general laws of the state concerning conduct of proceedings of public commissions, bodies, and governmental units.
(i)

(2)
The Cherokee County Municipal Planning Commission shall consist of nine members. The Board of Commissioners of Cherokee County shall appoint seven of the members with each commissioner having one appointment to run concurrently with the term of the person so appointing. In addition, two members shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Cherokee County as a whole to serve at the pleasure of the commission.

(j)
Conduct of hearings. The following policies and procedures shall govern the conduct of hearings under this article:
(1)
The chairman shall open any hearing with an explanation of the purpose of the hearing and description of the general rules for the conduct of the hearing and the authority and role of the hearing body in any zoning decision. The order of cases may be altered at the discretion of the chairman. An individual requesting to be heard on a matter germane to the purpose of the hearing must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the body. The chairman shall chair the hearing and shall determine germaneness of any comment or presentation to the planning commission in the hearing and is authorized to rule any individual or a portion of any comment or presentation out of order. However, the chairman may predetermine the length of any hearing allotting equal time to proponents and opponents of any proposed zoning amendment. To the extent that there are both proponents and opponents of any proposed zoning amendment and the fact that equal time is not in fact utilized by either position shall not invalidate any proceedings or action taken on the proposed amendment.
(2)
The planning commission may determine that an application for zoning amendment was or was not properly filed or that the type of decision for which the application calls can or can not be heard by it. The chairman may make determinations as to whether proper public notice of the hearing was given and continue the case where it was not.
(3)
The chairman shall allow the person initiating the proposed zoning amendment request or his designee to present a description of the proposed zoning amendment and the reason for initiating the proposed zoning amendment. Materials or evidence which could have, but were not, filed with the application may be rejected and not admitted. All materials except those which are clearly for rebuttal purposes shall be submitted by the close of the presentation of the case in order to be considered.
(4)
Speakers at the public hearing for or against the application may be required by the chairman to sign in, giving name, residential address, and telephone number, before being allowed to speak. Speakers may be allowed ten minutes for each presentation of new evidence or information. Any person requesting to address the body, upon being recognized by the chairman, shall state his name, residence address, and telephone number before proceeding with any comment, remarks, or presentation. Any person addressing the body shall respond to questions of the chairman or members.
(5)
Failure of the applicant or his agents to be present at the public hearing constitutes abandonment and dismissal of the case, unless the applicant shows just cause by reason of illness or health or other emergency within a reasonable time, in writing, and accompanied by new costs for readvertisement and hearing.
(6)
Evidence or documents presented for consideration become part of the public file; however, substitutions of copies may be made where approved of by the chairman.
(7)
The chairman may alternate the order of persons speaking to accommodate unusual situations. The chairman may divide presentations into blocks of time beginning with proponents and followed by opposition. The chairman may direct that proponents and opponents designate one or more spokespersons for presentations of favorable and opposing views on the proposed zoning amendment.
(8)
All materials or evidence which persons in opposition wish to be considered must be submitted by the conclusion of the opposition portion of the hearing.
(9)
The chairman may poll the public assemblage at any hearing concerning its concurrence or opposition. However, upon the request of the applicant or a spokesman for the opposition, persons responding may be required to give written information as to name, residential address, and the area in which each resides. The count of those in favor and in opposition will be entered in the record of the hearing.
(10)
Any remark amounting to attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual or comment not factually supportable or comment in the form of an emotional outburst shall be nongermane to the purpose of any hearing, may be ruled out of order, and may be disregarded.
(11)
Upon conclusion of the presentation of persons opposing the proposed zoning amendment, the chairman shall afford the person initiating the petition an allotted time to address the body in rebuttal of any issue raised by persons in opposition; and the applicant may submit materials or evidence associated with rebuttal. The chairman may rule out of order the raising of any new issues which are not clearly rebuttal, unless the information was requested by a member of the hearing body. Where a new issue is allowed to be raised in rebuttal, a spokesman for persons opposing the proposed zoning amendment shall be allocated an equal amount of time to address such new issue. The applicant is not thereafter granted additional rebuttal time except in the discretion of the chairman.
(12)
When proponents and opponents of the proposed zoning amendment request have been heard in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the public hearing is closed and no further evidence or testimony may be presented unless either the record is left open based on a request for additional material or report, or questions are asked of the applicant or opposition, in which case both sides shall be entitled to a response but there is no right of rebuttal.
(k)
Planning commission action.
(1)
The planning commission may recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial of the proposed zoning amendment. If a decision is not reached, the matter continues to be tabled for consideration until a vote carries. A report or minutes of the planning commission's recommendation accompanying a summary of the proceedings of the hearing shall be submitted to the city council. The planning commission shall include recommendations for conditions or limitations on uses appropriate to ameliorate the impact on the surrounding area. Where the applicant does not agree to such conditions or limitations on uses, the recommendation shall be interpreted as a recommendation for denial unless the conditions or limitations are accepted by the applicant.
