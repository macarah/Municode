ARTICLE IV. - ZONING DISTRICTS

Sec. 34-101. - AG, Agricultural District.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This zoning district implements the "agricultural" character area of the Nicholson Comprehensive Plan as shown on the future development map of the community agenda. The agricultural zoning district is established with the intent of providing for agricultural and forestry uses in the city. It is also intended to retain the agricultural and rural character of the city. Much of the land in this category is simply vacant or undeveloped, but other tracts are forested and there is also some raising of livestock in this zoning district. The general intensity of development is very low. Residential land uses are allowed but they are limited to single-family, site-built homes on individual lots and manufactured homes on individual lots. Conventional suburban subdivisions even at low densities are considered incompatible with desired agricultural character. In agricultural zoning districts, public water may or may not be available, and sanitary sewer service is not available.
(b)
Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Table 34-1, "Permitted and Conditional Uses for Zoning Districts."
(c)
Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 34-2, "Dimensional Requirements for Zoning Districts."
(Code 2018, § 16.401)
Sec. 34-102. - RR, Rural Residential District.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This zoning district implements the "large lot - rural residential" character area of the Nicholson Comprehensive Plan as shown on the future development map of the community agenda. The rural residential zoning district is established with the intent of retaining the rural residential character of neighborhoods, subdivisions, and settlements in city. The general intensity of development is low. In rural residential zoning districts, public water may or may not be available, and sanitary sewer service is not available. Single-family, site built and manufactured homes are permitted. Density of development is generally too low to support the provision of pedestrian facilities (sidewalks). The overall intent of this zoning district is to preserve rural and estate residential character, and provide for very low density rural residential uses. Areas designated as RR zoning are inappropriate for urban development.
(b)
Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Table 34-1, "Permitted and Conditional Uses for Zoning Districts."
(c)
Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 34-2, "Dimensional Requirements for Zoning Districts."
(Code 2018, § 16.402)
Sec. 34-103. - SR, Suburban Residential District.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This zoning district implements the "in-town/suburban residential" character area of the Nicholson Comprehensive Plan as shown on the future development map of the community agenda. This zoning district provides areas for conventionally constructed (stick/site built) detached, single-family homes at suburban densities. Manufactured homes are not permitted in this zoning district. Subdivisions in this zoning district are typically built to conventional, suburban subdivision design principles including curvilinear streets and streets ending in circular cul-de-sacs. In suburban residential zoning districts, public water is typically available, and sanitary sewer service is generally not available. Therefore, the general intensity of development is low to moderate, limited by the lack of sanitary sewer service. Lots generally meet health department requirements for on-site sewage management systems (e.g., septic tanks) where public water is available. New subdivisions built to traditional neighborhood development principles (connected streets in a grid or grid-like pattern) are also permitted and encouraged, particularly where located within walking distance to the TC, Town Center zoning district. Densities are, however, sufficient to support pedestrian activity, particularly in connection with uses in the Town Center zoning district.
(b)
Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Table 34-1, "Permitted and Conditional Uses for Zoning Districts."
(c)
Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 34-2, "Dimensional Requirements for Zoning Districts."
(Code 2018, § 16.403)
Sec. 34-104. - INST, Institutional District.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This zoning district implements the "government-institutional" character area of the Nicholson Comprehensive Plan as shown on the future development map of the community agenda. This zoning district accommodates federal, state, or local government uses outside of the Town Center zoning district, and a wide variety of institutional land uses. Government uses include but are not limited to fire stations and schools. Private institutional uses include schools, churches, cemeteries, and private nonprofit meeting halls, among others.
(b)
Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Table 34-1, "Permitted and Conditional Uses for Zoning Districts."
(c)
Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 34-2, "Dimensional Requirements for Zoning Districts."
(d)
Design review requirement. There shall be a design review requirement for buildings, structures, signs, and land development in the Institutional zoning district. No material change in appearance to an external design feature on a lot shall occur, and the City shall not issue a development permit as required by section 34-296, a building permit as required by section 34-297, or a certificate of occupancy as required by section 34-298, until and unless a design review permit has been approved and issued in accordance with section 34-299 or a design review permit exemption has been approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with section 34-300.
(Code 2018, § 16.404; Ord. of 9-12-2013)
Sec. 34-105. - TC, Town Center District.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This zoning district implements the "town center" character area of the Nicholson Comprehensive Plan as shown on the future development map of the community agenda. The Town Center District envisions the long-term transformation of the central area of the city into a concentrated downtown core. Water service is available, and sanitary sewer service is eventually contemplated to be provided, though it does not exist at the time this zoning district is established in 2010. Commercial uses are permitted but they are required to be pedestrian oriented. Certain highway-oriented uses are excluded, as they are more appropriately located in HB, Highway Business zoning district and if permitted in the TC zoning district would detract from the desired compact, pedestrian oriented character of the TC zoning district. Residential uses are also permitted and are encouraged to be co-located with commercial uses in mixed-use developments. Institutional uses such as churches are also permitted in the TC zoning district.
(b)
Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Table 34-1, "Permitted and Conditional Uses for Zoning Districts."
(c)
Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 34-2, "Dimensional Requirements for Zoning Districts."
(d)
Design review requirement. There shall be a design review requirement for buildings, structures, signs, and land development in the Town Center zoning district. No material change in appearance to an external design feature on a lot shall occur, and the City shall not issue a development permit as required by section 34-296, a building permit as required by section 34-297, or a certificate of occupancy as required by section 34-298, until and unless a design review permit has been approved and issued in accordance with section 34-299 or a design review permit exemption has been approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with section 34-300.
(Code 2018, § 16.405; Ord. of 9-12-2013)
Sec. 34-106. - HB, Highway Business District.
(a)
Purpose and intent. This zoning district implements the "highway commercial" character area of the Nicholson Comprehensive Plan as shown on the future development map of the community agenda. This zoning district accommodates mostly non-industrial business uses, including retail sales, offices, services, restaurants and commercial recreational facilities. Industrial establishments are generally not permitted but certain establishments with industrial-type characteristics are permitted or conditional uses. Furthermore, this zoning district is more permissive than the TC, Town Center zoning district in that it permits a variety of highway-oriented commercial uses. This zoning district is intended to be limited primarily, if not exclusively, to properties fronting on U.S. Highway 441. In highway business zoning districts, public water is generally available, but sanitary sewer service is generally not available. Development in this district is mostly auto-dependent, although sidewalks exist along much of U.S. Highway 441.
(b)
Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Table 34-1, "Permitted and Conditional Uses for Zoning Districts."
(c)
Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 34-2, "Dimensional Requirements for Zoning Districts."
(d)
Design review requirement. There shall be a design review requirement for buildings, structures, signs, and land development in the Highway Business zoning district. No material change in appearance to an external design feature on a lot shall occur, and the City shall not issue a development permit as required by section 34-296, a building permit as required by section 34-297, or a certificate of occupancy as required by section 34-298, until and unless a design review permit has been approved and issued in accordance with section 34-299 or a design review permit exemption has been approved by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with section 34-300.
