Chapter 26 - SIGNS AND ADVERTISING DEVICES
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 26-1. - Findings.
There is a substantial and compelling governmental interest to control signs and other advertising devices for the following reasons, among others:
(1)
Signs by their very nature are intended to gain the attention of motorists, and therefore distract them from the primary purpose of maneuvering a vehicle along a road. Sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents;
(2)
Signage, if left unregulated, can cause confusion and delay in responding to emergencies, because unregulated signs can degrade the utility and reduce the visibility and effectiveness of public safety signs;
(3)
Unregulated signage can contribute to clutter and lack of organization in the wayfinding system of a community and thereby increase the stress levels of motorists;
(4)
The appearance of the city is substantially influenced by signs, and it is essential to the city's long-term economic viability to maintain a positive appearance. Signs and advertising, without regulation, can detract from the character, beauty, and visual attractiveness of the city;
(5)
The size, height, construction materials, location, condition, and attributes of signs can have an adverse impact on surrounding and nearby land uses and properties if not regulated and properly maintained, including the lowering of property values. Abandoned and antiquated signs and sign structures (e.g., a pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can have a particularly detrimental effect on adjacent properties, and contribute to an overall image of blight in the community;
(6)
Sign regulations help to ensure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets and other public structures and spaces are protected. Unregulated signs can neutralize the value and benefit of public investments in streetscapes;
(7)
Sign regulations benefit businesses that seek to advertise. Unregulated commercial signage can be detrimental to individual businesses, because business owners may be compelled to erect larger and costlier signs to outperform neighboring or nearby businesses. Such competition for visibility among businesses can result in too many signs and excessive sizes and heights, to a point of diminishing returns where individual business signs are no longer adequately visible. If unregulated, the competition for visual recognition can defeat the purpose of the signs, which is to carry a message. If signs are left unregulated, patrons of individual businesses may miss their destinations because they cannot find the particular business of choice in the sea of advertising devices;
(8)
Signs placed on building walls and in windows can be excessive if not regulated as to the area of the sign face, and it is in the public interest to ensure that building and window signs are proportional to the building wall or window on which the signs are placed. It is considered inappropriate to attach signs to certain objects like rocks and benches, thereby justifying certain prohibitions. It is also considered inappropriate to allow signs on roofs of buildings, justifying prohibition, since roof signs interrupt the silhouette of the building, overpower the architecture of the building, and can also block views;
(9)
Some signs and advertising devices are designed to move in the wind. For instance, a flag, or feather banners (also called "wind blades"), or ribbons on strings, etc., are designed to capture attention due to movement in the wind. Such signs and advertising devices have greater potential for attracting attention to them given their movement. Without regulations and prohibitions on these types of advertising devices, the result would be clutter, degradation of community appearance, and decrease in public safety;
(10)
Signs which are lighted at night give the appearance of activity or operation that is not consistent with the residential character of certain parts of the city. Signs that are internally illuminated also tend to give the appearance of a business area. It is appropriate to control the lighting of signs and to make distinctions on where signs may need to remain unlit, and also where internally illuminated signs are permitted. Lights that flash or blink or vary in intensity have greater potential to attract attention, but also a greater probability of distracting motorists. It is in the interests of the city to prohibit lighting practices on signs that are likely to distract motorists. The luminance of a sign (a measurable quantity) can also be perceived by humans as too bright or imposing glare, or causing a nuisance, and it is in the interest of the city to control the intensity of lighting. Electronic changeable copy signs pose special issues, and deserve individual regulation specific to that type of sign;
(11)
Signs, if improperly maintained, present an unkempt appearance and may present an image of blight to visitors, residents, and employees. It is in the interest of the city to ensure that signs are properly maintained to avoid the appearance of blight, and also to prevent possible detrimental impact on property values that may result from such blight;
(12)
The regulations contained in this chapter are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests and purposes identified in this chapter.

Sec. 26-3. - Intentions.
(a)
Time, place, and manner restrictions. It is the intent of this chapter to regulate the composition, type, location, placement, height, size, quantity, illumination, duration, and manner of signs and advertising devices that may be displayed. The regulation of these aspects of signs and sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the intentions and purposes of this chapter.
