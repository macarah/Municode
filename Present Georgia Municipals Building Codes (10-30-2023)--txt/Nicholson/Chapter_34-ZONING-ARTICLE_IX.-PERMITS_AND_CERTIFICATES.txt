Sec. 34-299. - Design review permit.
(a)
Permit required. Unless specifically exempted by the provisions of section 34-300, a design review permit shall be required to be issued by the planning commission, acting as the design review board, prior to the establishment of a use, or erection of a building or structure, or the occupancy of land or water within the INST, TC, and HB zoning districts.
(b)
Application requirements. A design review permit requires an application to be made by the property owner or agent for the property owner. At a minimum, application requirements shall include the materials specified for a development permit in section 34-296. The planning commission may refuse to act on an incomplete application or an application for design review permit that fails to contain submission materials with respect to design that it finds necessary to make a decision on said permit, which may include a site plan and landscaping plan, building elevation drawings, photographs, and/or color and material samples for building materials.
(c)
Criteria for decisions. The planning commission shall act in an administrative decision-making context and shall base its decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny material changes in appearance proposed in an application for a design review permit on the proposed development, building, or structure's consistency with any design guidelines adopted by the City Council; as well as the design and appropriateness of the external design features, including but not limited to arrangement, building bulk, colors, character, cohesiveness, continuity, harmony, landscapes, materials, scale, streetscapes, and texture, and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures and development in the immediate surrounding area. Grounds for denying an application for design review permit may include, but are not limited to, character foreign to the area; arresting and spectacular effects; violent contrasts of material or color, or intense or lurid colors; a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance; and/or the absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the density and character of the present structure or surrounding area. In granting a design review permit, however, the planning commission may also impose such reasonable requirements and conditions with respect to the location, construction, maintenance, and operation of any use or building, whether or not articulated in design guidelines adopted by the City Council, as may be deemed necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest.
(d)
Timeframe for decision. The planning commission shall make a final determination on a complete application for a design review permit within 45 days from the date a complete application is received. If the design review permit is denied, the Zoning Administrator shall prepare a written notice to the property owner or applicant stating in writing the reason or reasons the planning commission denied the design review permit.
(e)
Records of decisions. The planning commission shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions with respect to design review permit applications, all of which shall be filed with the City Clerk and which shall be public record.
(f)
Appeal of decision. Decisions of the planning commission with respect to issuance or denial of a design review permit shall be final unless within 30 days of the decision an appeal of the decision of the planning commission is filed with the City Council by the property owner, or an aggrieved property owner with standing, in which case the Mayor and City Council shall decide such appeal and affirm or overturn the decision of the planning commission. In processing any such appeal, the procedure shall be governed by section 34-261, with the exceptions that transmittal to and recommendation by the planning commission shall not be required; the application shall proceed directly to the City Council.
(g)
Changes after permit issuance. After the issuance of a design review permit, no material change in the appearance of a site, building, or structure shall be made or permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless and until all requirements of this section are met.
(h)
Exclusions. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior design feature in or on property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a material change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof; nor to prevent the property owner from making any use of property not prohibited by other laws, ordinances, or regulations.
(i)
Enforcement. The city, through the Zoning Administrator, code enforcement officer, or city attorney, shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in the appearance of a land, water, building, or structure subject to the requirements of this section, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this section.
