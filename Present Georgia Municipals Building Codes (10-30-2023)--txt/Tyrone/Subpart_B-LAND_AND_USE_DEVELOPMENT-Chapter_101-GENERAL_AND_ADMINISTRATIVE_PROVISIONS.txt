Building permit means the permit required for new construction pursuant to the town building code. The term "building permit" shall not include permits required for remodeling, rehabilitation or other improvements to an existing structure, provided there is no increase in the number of units resulting therefrom.
Capital improvement means an improvement with a useful life of ten years or more, by new construction or other action, which increases the service capacity of a public facility.
Capital improvements element means that portion of the comprehensive plan which sets out projected needs for system improvements during a planning horizon established in the comprehensive plan, a schedule of capital improvements that will meet the anticipated need for system improvements, and a description of anticipated funding sources for each required improvement.
Commencement of construction or commenced construction means expenditure of any funds, whether they be development impact fee funds or not, for a public facilities project, marshaling of forces to undertake a public facilities project, or advertising of bids to undertake a public facilities project, or any action normally found to proceed subsequent to these actions in a typical flow of project construction activities.
Developer means any person or legal entity undertaking development.
Development means any construction or expansion of a building, structure, or use, any change in use of a building or structure, or any change in the use of land, any of which creates additional demand and need for public facilities.
Development approval means any written authorization from the town which allows the commencement of construction.
Development exaction means a requirement attached to a development approval or other municipal or county action approving or authorizing a particular development project, including but not limited to a rezoning, which requirement compels the payment, dedication or construction of goods, services, land or money as a condition of approval.

Encumber means to legally obligate by contract, or otherwise commit to use by appropriation or other official act of the town.
Excess capacity means capacity of a public facility or system of public facilities which is beyond that necessary to provide service at a specified level of service.
Feepayor means that person who pays a development impact fee, or his successor in interest, where the right or entitlement to any refund of previously paid development impact fees has been expressly transferred or assigned to the successor in interest. In the absence of an express transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to any fund of previously paid development impact fees, the right or entitlement shall be deemed "not to run with the land."
Individual assessment study means the engineering and/or economic documentation prepared by a feepayor to allow determination of a development impact fee other than by use of an applicable fee schedule, as required by O.C.G.A. § 36-71-4(g).

Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included if the impact fees are to be used for the payments of principal and interest on bonds, notes or other financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the town to finance the capital improvements element, but such costs do not include routine and periodic maintenance expenditures, personnel training and other operating costs.
System improvements means capital improvements that are public facilities and are designed to provide service to the community at large, in contrast to project improvements.

Sec. 101-68. - Credits.
(a)
In the calculation of development impact fees for a particular project, credits shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution, dedication of land, or money required or accepted by the town from a developer, or his predecessor in title or interest, for system improvements of the category for which the development impact fee is being collected. Credits shall not be given for project improvements.
(b)
In the event a building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the development impact fee against future development impact fees for the same parcel of land.
(c)
Credits under subsection (a) of this section shall be valued using the following guidelines:
(1)
For the present value of the construction of any system improvements required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the town from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the developer must present evidence of the costs and age of the improvement from which present value may be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) as estimates of inflation and depreciation.
(2)
For the present value of any contribution or dedication of land required or accepted for system improvements, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought by the town from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value for contributed land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the current validated town tax appraisal at the time of dedication; present value shall be calculated from the time of dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(3)
For the present value of any contribution or dedication of money required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the town from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value of contributed money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution or dedication; present value shall be calculated from time of contribution or dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent).
(d)
Upon submission of adequate evidence that a development impact fee was previously paid and that the building permit has expired, credit for the present value of the development impact fee shall be in the amount of the development impact fee paid, inflated from the date of payments using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent), and shall be applied against that parcel of land. Should the development impact fee be less than the amount credited under the circumstances previously mentioned herein, the excess credit shall remain with the town. Should the development impact fee be greater than the amount credited, under the circumstances previously mentioned, the developer shall pay the difference to the town.
(e)
In the event that a developer enters into an agreement with the town to construct, fund or contribute system improvements such that the amount of credit created by such construction, funding or contribution exceeds the development impact fee calculated for the project, the developer shall be compensated for such excess contribution by the town or, at the town's option, from development impact fees paid by other developments located in the service area benefited by such improvements.
(f)
The present value of any such construction or contribution shall be established by:
(1)
Use of documented prices actually paid by the developer for the system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent);
(2)
Use of documented prices which would have been paid by the town for such system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent), whichever is less.
The town is under no obligation to make immediate compensation, but will make compensation if funds are available.
(g)
Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, no credits shall be given for construction, contribution or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article nor shall credit be given for system improvements or funds for system improvements constructed, contributed or dedicated after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article if an agreement to do so was entered into before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article for projects which have already received a building permit.
(h)
In the event that a feepayor has, under previously established conditions of zoning, constructed, contributed or dedicated system improvements or funds when receiving permits to proceed with only a portion or phase of a project as defined by a particular zoning case, where the construction, contribution or dedication is in excess of that required by the portion or phase permitted, the excess construction, contribution or dedication shall be credited against future development impact fees which shall be required as additional portions or phases of the zoned projects seeking building permits.
(i)
The developer must present adequate evidence of the cost and age of the improvement from which present value may be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) estimates of inflation and depreciation.
(j)
Credits required under subsection (b) of this section shall be automatically given at the time of fee imposition. Any other credits shall be given only upon request by the developer to the town administrator. To receive consideration for such other credits, a developer must present adequate evidence or proposals for creditable activities and adequate evidence of value to the town administrator at or before the time of application for a building permit.
(k)
The town administrator shall review all claims for allowance and valuation of credits and make determinations regarding:
(1)
Allowance of any claimed credit;
(2)
Value of any allowed credit.
(l)
Any credits shall be acknowledged in writing and calculated at the time of imposition of the development impact fee. A developer may appeal any such determination by following the guidelines established in section 101-62 (Appeals).
