ARTICLE XI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 22-581. - Purpose and findings.
(a)
It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or the effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
(b)
Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and council, and on studies in other communities, including but not limited to the experience of the cities of College Park, Forest Park, Marietta, and Smyrna, the mayor and council finds:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. The commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when such is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. There is a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials.
(2)
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
(3)
Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which create unhealthy conditions. Further, such establishments escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminished property values, and cause increases in the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, increases in the burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council finds such business establishments bring to a community. The negative effects such businesses cause are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but that other forms of sexually oriented businesses also have deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bathhouses, adult gift and novelty shops, and lingerie or nude modeling studios.
(4)
Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components.
(5)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities there are unhealthy, and in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
(6)
The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (5) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(7)
A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(8)
Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments.
(9)
Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
(10)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
(11)
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this article.
