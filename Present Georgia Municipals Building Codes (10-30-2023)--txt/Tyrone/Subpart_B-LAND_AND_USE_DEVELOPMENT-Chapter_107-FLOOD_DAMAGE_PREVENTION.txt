Sec. 107-2. - Findings.
(a)
The mayor and town council have determined that the flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
The mayor and town council have determined that flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
(c)
The mayor and town council have determined that effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can:
(1)
Protect human life and health;
(2)
Minimize damage to private property;
(3)
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure, such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; and
(4)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(d)
Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section O.C.G.A. § 36-35-23(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and town council do hereby ordain this chapter and establish this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure; and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(5)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(6)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(7)
In reviewing such requests, the town manager or his designee and mayor and town council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
(8)
Conditions for variances.
a.
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
1.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
2.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
3.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance.
b.
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
c.
Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided.
d.
The town manager or his designee shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the state department of natural resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(9)
Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the town manager or his designee and mayor and town council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.
(10)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the town manager or his designee and the mayor and town council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter.
(11)
Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

ARTICLE III. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION

Sec. 107-60. - Standards for development.
(a)
Definition of floodplain boundaries.
(1)
Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available.
(2)
For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the town manager or his designee. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the town manager or his designee, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the town manager or his designee.
(b)
Definition of floodway boundaries. The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the town manager or his designee. If floodway data is not available from the town manager, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the town manager or his designee.
(c)
General standards.
(1)
No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following:
a.
Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;
b.
Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity;
c.
Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or
d.
Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities or resulting in excessive sedimentation.
(2)
Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection (c)(1) of this section shall also meet the following conditions:
a.
Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and either lie within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed or shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel;
b.
Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent;
c.
Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;
d.
Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 107-61(d);
e.
Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and
f.
Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the town manager or his designee using the FEMA community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR).
(d)
Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachment. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 107-61(d) apply. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the town manager or his designee prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include:
(1)
Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development;
(2)
Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the town manager or his designee. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles;
(3)
Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;
(4)
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.
(e)
Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(1)
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (e)(2) of this section;
(2)
Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and
(3)
If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the town manager or his designee until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the town manager or his designee.
(f)
Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The town manager or his designee may direct the property owner (at no cost to the town) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the town manager.
