ARTICLE 4. - ZONING DISTRICTS

Section 401. - R-1, Low-Density Residential District.
401-1 Purpose and intent. The R-1 district is intended to provide land areas primarily devoted to a range of single-family dwelling types, reflecting much of the existing residential neighborhoods in the city. The R-1 district establishes a density of four dwelling units per gross acre. The R-1 district is applied to parcels to accommodate existing residential units on land having a predominantly single family detached unit subdivision character and associated uses which are anticipated to maintain such character; to accommodate traditional single family detached residential neighborhoods; and to accommodate revitalization and/or infill of such neighborhoods with residential products of comparable type and density. The district generally corresponds to the 2030 Comprehensive Plan Character Area designation of "Established Residential."
401-2 Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Article 6, "Use and Supplemental Conditions Tables." In cases where a use is permitted but there are specific use regulations for that use specified in Article 7, such regulations shall also apply and must be complied with.
401-3 Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 4.1, "Dimensional Requirements for Residential Zoning Districts."
401-4 Design principles and guidelines. Design criteria to be applied in this zoning district shall be as provided in Table 4.2, "Design Criteria for Residential Zoning Districts."
Section 402. - R-2, Medium-Density Residential District.
402-1 Purpose and intent. The R-2 district is intended to provide land areas devoted to moderate density uses consisting primarily of detached single-family uses. Attached single-family dwellings townhomes, duplexes, clustered and cottage housing types and other creative, flexible small lot development designs, and multi-family residential uses may be appropriate where similar uses or densities exist or adjacent to higher density districts. Land areas zoned R-2 are also intended to provide a transition between lower density single-family residential districts and: the MU District; higher density multi-family, and commercial business uses within the U.S. 29 Corridor Overlay, and other non-residential areas. The R-2 district is to be located where there is convenient access to collector streets, major thoroughfares, and the state/interstate highway system. The district generally corresponds to the 2019 Comprehensive Plan Character Area designation of "Established Residential", with portions which may be contained within the U.S. 29 Corridor Overlay.
402-2 Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Article 6, "Use and Supplemental Conditions Tables." In cases where a use is permitted but there are specific use regulations for that use specified in Article 7, such regulations shall also apply and must be complied with.
402-3 Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 4.1, "Dimensional Requirements for Residential Zoning Districts."

Section 405. - IA, Industrial Activity District.
405-1 Purpose and intent. The purpose of the IA district is twofold: to provide suitable areas for service-oriented business, and industrial operations and processes integrated with office and/or showroom uses, and related ancillary retail and service activities, with a minimum of interference from traffic and conflicting uses; and to provide and protect areas for processing, fabricating, manufacturing, warehousing, and research industrial uses which do not create noise, odor, smoke, vibration, dust or other emissions and which do not possess other objectionable characteristics that might be detrimental to surrounding neighborhoods or other uses permitted in the district. This district also includes more intensive auto repair establishments and those industrial uses which cannot comply with the limited emissions characteristics, but do comply with all state and federal guidelines for emissions and discharge of effluents into the air, water, and soil, subject to administrative conditional approval or special use permit.
Site standards and design/screening measures are required. Outdoor storage and display is permitted in this district with regulation in association with specified uses in this district. Properties within the IA district generally correspond to the 2030 Comprehensive Plan Character Area designation of "Outlying Commercial and Industrial."
405-2 Permitted and conditional uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Article 6, "Use and Supplemental Conditions Tables." Uses may be clustered into industrial parks, as differentiated by proportion of office and showroom/retail operations, or as stand-alone facilities. More intense and industrial uses potentially incompatible with adjacent properties require conditional or SUP approval.
405-3 Dimensional requirements. Dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 4.3, "Dimensional Requirements for Nonresidential Zoning Districts."

Compatibility. New development and improvements to existing properties need to be compatible with the existing character, including the sensitive treatment of perimeter property lines to mitigate impacts on abutting properties. A A A A
Historic Character. In areas with identified historic buildings, structures, and sites, the proposed new development or land activity blends with or complements the historic character. A A A A
Alternative Transportation. New development should accommodate and facilitate alternatives to transportation by automobile, including bicycle and pedestrian facilities. A A A A
Pedestrian Access. All likely pedestrian routes should be identified in the design phase and provided for in the development. These include linkages to individual buildings, neighboring properties (when compatible), and existing or planned sidewalks along public roads, as appropriate. A A A A
Open Spaces. Small public open spaces (e.g., plazas, pocket parks, and squares) are integrated into projects of sufficient size (i.e., two acres or more). A A A A
Access and Parking. The development provides for adequate access and off-street parking arrangements. A A A A
Fences and Walls. Fences and walls shall be of the same or compatible material, in terms of texture and quality, as the material and color of the principal building. A A A A
Chain Link Fencing. Chain link fencing is prohibited in front yards and discouraged in other locations but if used, it should be vinyl coated (black, brown, or green color encouraged). A A A A
Operations. All manufacturing, processing, assembly, fabrication, servicing, and repair operations, when permitted, are carried out within an entirely enclosed building. A N/A N/A A
Appearance/Parking. The development layout avoids the appearance of strip commercial development, including the specific provision that no more than ¬Ω of any required parking is located between the public street and the principal building line. A A A A
Parking Screen. Where parking areas are located between a public street and the principal building, vegetation, walls, fences, berms, or some combination is used to screen the view from the street to parking areas, except for approved drives and lot entrances. A A A A
Temporary Buildings. No establishment operates in any non-permanent structure such as a tent, mobile unit, trailer, recreational vehicle, or other temporary building or structure. A A A A
Storage. Equipment and materials must be stored within completely enclosed buildings, unless otherwise permitted. A A A N/A
Loading. All loading areas and facilities are located at the side or rear of a principal building. A A A A
Waste Containers. Trash enclosures should be constructed of sturdy, durable, opaque materials (with trash receptacles screened from view.) A A A A
Multiple Buildings‚ÄîCompatibility. Multi-unit developments or sites with more than one building shall utilize a consistent or at least stylistically compatible (but not necessarily identical) palette of scale, forms, colors, materials, and textures. A A A A
Accessory Buildings. Accessory structures should be architecturally compatible with the principal building or buildings. A A A A
Building Materials. On front fa√ßades and other building sides visible from a public right-of-way, exterior building materials should not include any of the following: smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels, prefabricated steel panels, highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; mill-finish (non-colored) aluminum metal windows or door frames, exposed, unfinished walls, exposed plywood or particle board, and unplastered, exposed concrete masonry blocks.

Section 406. - MU, Mixed-Use District.
406-1 Purpose and intent. The MU district is intended to accommodate creative mixed-use development along Lilburn's arterials in appropriate locations to promote redevelopment of under-utilized properties and support the transitioning of these areas from primarily low density residential to complementary groupings of mixed-use buildings and sites that include community and neighborhood scale retail and services, professional offices, varied housing options, and open space. Mixed-use development provides a compatible mix of non-residential uses with housing opportunities within the immediate area, either in the same building or in proximity, while maintaining a healthy living environment for the residents of the district.
The MU district is also intended to encourage flexible, innovative and creative concepts in site planning; the efficient reuse of land in transitioning areas; a stable multiple-use environment that is compatible with adjacent uses and established neighborhoods; and walking and bicycling through improved connectivity.
This type of development can accommodate a variety of housing options and densities; however, a mix of housing types and densities alone does not constitute a mixed-use development.
The MU District is specifically applicable to properties within the Character Areas identified as Town Center Overlay and Lawrenceville Highway Overlay depicted on the Lilburn 2019 Comprehensive Plan Character Area Map. All properties within these Character Areas and others that support a mix of highly compatible uses within a single development, are eligible to apply for rezoning to the Mixed-Use Zoning District.
406-2 Permitted uses. Permitted uses shall be as provided in Article 6, "Use and Supplemental Conditions Tables" upon Master Concept Plan approval. A mix of residential and non-residential uses is required according to Table 4.6, MU Land Use Requirements. Non-residential uses must be developed concurrently with residential uses according to Sec. 736.
