It is also the intent of this section to permit the filing of an application for variance simultaneously with a rezoning, special use permit, change in conditions of zoning or conditional use application, and have the concurrent variance and companion application(s) considered in the same cycle of review (i.e., "concurrent" variance application). However, no variance shall be approved prior to the City Council's final action.

Member shall be removable for cause by the Mayor and Council of the City upon written charges and after a public hearing.

d.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be a public record.
1005-3. Zoning board of appeals powers.
1.
To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Director in the enforcement of this Zoning Resolution.
2.
To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, variances from the terms of the Zoning Resolution as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the Zoning Resolution will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the Zoning Resolution shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justices done. Such variances may be granted in individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that:
a.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions or practical difficulties pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
b.
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Article would effectively deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located, resulting in unnecessary hardship.
c.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved.
d.
The special circumstances are not the result of any actions of the property owner.
e.
Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located.
f.
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Article and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
g.
The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the proposed use of the land, building, or structure in the zoning district in which the development is located.
3.
In exercising the above powers, the Zoning Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this Resolution, reverse decisions or determinations from which the appeal is taken and, to that end, assume all the powers of the Director from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or revoke or direct the issuance or revocation of a Building or other permit.
1005-4. Pre-application conference encouraged. Applicants for variances are encouraged, but not required to schedule an applicant orientation meeting with the Director. An applicant orientation meeting is a time where applicants can seek a determination of the number and nature of variances required, familiarize themselves with the application requirements and processes, and gain preliminary input from staff as to the suitability of the proposed variance(s).

1005-6. Regulations that cannot be varied. Variances shall not be granted to (a) minimum lot size requirements of a given zoning district; or (b) permit a use which is not permitted in the zoning district in pertaining to the subject property (i.e., a "use" variance).

3.
Metes and bounds legal description of the property;

5.
Letter of intent describing the regulations to be varied (specific sections and the amount of numerical variation sought), and including analysis of how the proposed development compares favorably with one or more of the criteria for granting variances as established in this section;
6.
If pertaining to future development, a site plan of the property and proposed development shall be submitted at an appropriate engineering scale showing the proposed use and relevant information regarding the variance request. Site plans must show information as reasonably required by the Director.
1005-9. Required public hearings by the zoning board of appeals. A public hearing shall be held before the Zoning Board of Appeals acts upon an application for a Variance.
1.
At least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Director shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the city a notice of the public hearing on the application. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. In addition, notice shall include the location of the property and the section(s) proposed to be varied.
2.
Not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the City shall erect, in a conspicuous place on the property or in the right-of-way along the frontage of the property, a sign that shall contain information as to the Variance applied for, the date, time and place of hearing.
3.
Failure to erect and maintain the sign as specified above shall not invalidate the subsequent determination of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

The Zoning Board of Appeals may approve or deny the application as proposed, or it may place conditions of approval on the application and approve the application with conditions.
1005-11. Withdrawal. Any application for variance may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the person or entity initiating such a request upon notice to the Director, up until the public hearing by the City Council. No refund of the required application fee or portion thereof shall be made once the application has been scheduled for public hearing.
1005-12. Reapplication to the zoning board of appeals. If an application for a Variance is denied by the Zoning Board of Appeals, a reapplication for such Variance may not be made earlier that 12 months from the date of the original application, unless such 12 month period is waived by the Zoning Board of Appeals, and in no case may such an application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of last action by the Zoning Board of Appeals, as appropriate.
1005-13. Appeals from decisions of the zoning board of appeals. Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may present an Appeal to the Gwinnet County Superior Court.
1.
Such an Appeal to the Superior Court shall be the same as an Appeal to the Superior Court from any decision made by the Probate Court and as specified in the official Code of Georgia except, however, that the Appeal shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
