Sec. 17-4. - Minimum requirements.
(a)
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection 17-4(b) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.
(b)
Minimum requirements enumerated. The property owner and/or his agents shall follow sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resulting sedimentation consistent with the following requirements:
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion.
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential.
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented.
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum.
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development.
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable.
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this section.
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills.
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property.
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners.
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum.
(14)
Erosion and sedimentation control plans shall include provisions for treatment to control any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent streams beyond the levels specified in subsection (17) of this section.
(15)
Land-disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 25 feet of the banks of any state waters, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq. title shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph; and
(16)
Land-disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-29 unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented.
(17)
a.  1.
Discharges of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas shall be controlled to the extent that turbidity of the stormwater runoff shall not exceed 100 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) higher than the turbidity level of the receiving stream immediately upstream from the stormwater runoff discharge at the time of such discharge; provided, however, that for trout streams, such maximum allowable turbidity level shall be 50 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) higher than the turbidity level of such stream immediately upstream from the stormwater runoff discharge at the time of such discharge. Due to the various soils and hydrological and water conditions throughout the state, the division shall have the discretion to vary from the aforesaid nephelometric turbidity units (NTU).
2.
On or after July 1, 1994, the board of natural resources shall be authorized to establish the maximum allowable turbidity levels at higher or lower levels or establish an equivalent method of determining the amount of sedimentation with corresponding standards by rule or regulation, but only after the board has considered the results of a study of nephelometric turbidity unit levels and alternative stands done under the auspices of the board of regents. Upon the adoption of such rule or regulation, the provisions of subsection 1. of this subsection a. shall be superseded by the provisions of this subsection 2.
b.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 17-4(b).
1.
If during a ten-year rainfall event or a rainfall event of greater magnitude, stormwater runoff turbidity exceeds the levels provided for in subsection 17-4(b)(17) or other turbidity requirements adopted by an issuing authority, such exceeding of such levels shall not constitute a violation of the requirements provided for or authorized under this Code section of all such requirements other than those relating to turbidity have been met.
2.
This subsection shall cease to apply upon the adoption of a rule or regulation as provided for in subsection 17-4(b)(17).
