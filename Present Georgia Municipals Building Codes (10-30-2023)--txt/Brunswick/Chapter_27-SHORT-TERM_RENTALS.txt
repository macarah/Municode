(d)
Should an accommodation excise tax certificate for any short-term rental be revoked under this chapter, then no accommodation excise tax certificate shall be issued for that property or to that property owner or certificate holder for that particular location for a period of 12 months after the effective date of the revocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a new certificate may be applied for and issued under an application that otherwise meets the application requirements of this chapter:
