Sec. 23-24-1. - Purpose and intent.
modified
(a)
The city commission of Brunswick finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of commercial and noncommercial messages. Regulation of the size, location, placement, illumination and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to receive such messages without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the city, to take advantage of the city's natural and historic environment, to protect property values, to facilitate safe travel through the city, to facilitate the identification and location of residences and businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies, and to avoid the aesthetic blight and nuisance that would occur from the proliferation of signs in the absence of reasonable controls. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city commission to establish regulations governing the display of signs so as to:
(1)
Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs in the city.
(2)
Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs;
(3)
Maximize the value of commercial signage as a means of locating and identifying commercial establishments providing goods and services while, at the same time, discouraging the use of commercial signage to sell specific goods and services;
(4)
Encourage the construction of commercial signage with high quality materials that are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with their surroundings and with the architecture of the buildings they identify;
(5)
Maintain the historical image and character of the city;
(6)
Preserve and enhance the natural environment throughout the city;
(7)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(8)
Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings;
(9)
Ensure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as appearance and attractiveness of signs.
(b)
Inasmuch as it is inappropriate for government to determine the content of expression that will be allowed on signs, it is the intent of the city commission that this chapter be interpreted and enforced without regard to the content to be posted on the sign.
(c)
It is the intent of this chapter that all signs erected in the city have a permit issued by the building official unless the sign is specifically excluded or exempted from the regulations contained in this chapter.
