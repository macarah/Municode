Sec. 18-10. - Collection of fees by tax commissioner or city commission designee for fees for service on and after January 1, 2010.
Beginning on January 1, 2010 and continuing thereafter, all billing for solid waste service in the City of Brunswick shall be billed under the following procedure. Bills for the subsequent year may be issued and become due prior to the date of service. Therefore, bills for the year 2010 may be billed in the year 2009, but shall be bills for service for the year 2010. The following procedure shall be followed beginning with billing for service to be received in the year 2010:
(a)
All fees for solid waste collection and disposal may be assessed upon the tax commissioner's books for each year and may be collected by the tax commissioner, should the city commission choose to designate the tax commissioner as the point of collection for fees for solid waste. After collection, the tax commissioner or whoever the city commission may designate shall transfer the solid waste fee to the city treasury at the same time as city ad valorem taxes. In collection, of this solid waste fee, the tax commissioner or city commission designee shall have the authority to resort to any remedy or right allowed by law for the collection and payment of city ad valorem taxes.
(b)
The tax commissioner or city commission designee shall prepare and mail to each owner of residential property and to each owner of a non-homestead mobile home an annual billing for solid waste fees. The property owner shall be assessed a solid waste fee for each dwelling unit on the property. The solid waste fee will appear as a separate line item assessment on the owner's annual property tax bill and shall become due and payable at the same that city taxes are due and payable. Each year's payment entitles the property owner to solid waste collection and disposal service for each dwelling unit at that property location for the succeeding year. If the solid waste fees remain unpaid, the tax commissioner or an authorized designee, shall have the authority to issue a writ of fieri facias or execution against the property served. The writ of fieri facias or execution shall have the same lien dignity and priority as a writ of fieri facias or execution issued for city ad valorem taxes. Each annual installment shall become a lien against the property served on January 1 of each year in the same manner and the same priority that lien attaches for city ad valorem taxes. Any solid waste fee that remains unpaid shall accrue penalty, interest, and fieri facias charges in the same manner and the same rate as delinquent city ad valorem taxes.
(c)
There shall be no free service offered by the City of Brunswick for solid waste sanitation service except as otherwise provided in this chapter.
(d)
The city commission of the City of Brunswick may choose to provide exceptions to the collection of solid waste service via the tax commissioner or whoever the city commission may designate, by instead submitting billing through other means which are hereby enumerated:
