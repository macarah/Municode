ARTICLE XVIII. - MED MEDICAL DISTRICT

Sec. 23-18-1. - Intent of district.
In view of the unique nature of hospitals, their land needs, and their effect on surrounding properties, it is the intent of the MED district that specific areas be set aside to permit hospitals and allied services, that such areas be protected against encroachment from nonrelated and incompatible uses, that provisions be made for the possible expansion of hospitals and allied services and that to the greatest possible extent, surrounding land uses and properties be stabilized against any possible detrimental effects that might be created by the proximity of the hospital and allied services.
