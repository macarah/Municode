If you refuse this testing, your privilege to operate a vessel on the waters of this state will be suspended for a minimum period of one year. Your refusal to submit to the required testing may be offered into evidence against you at trial. If you submit to testing, the results of that test or tests may be used against you. If the results of such test or tests indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.10 grams or more or the presence of any illegal drug, your privilege to operate a vessel on the waters of this state may be suspended for a minimum period of one year. After first submitting to the required state tests, you are entitled to additional chemical tests of your blood, breath, urine, or other bodily substances at your own expense and from qualified personnel of your own choosing. Will you submit to the state administered chemical tests of your (designate which tests) under the implied consent law?"

This notice shall be deemed sufficient if such notice read by an arresting officer is substantially complied with.

(d)
If a person under arrest or a person who was involved in any boating accident resulting in serious injuries or fatalities submits to a chemical test upon the request of a law enforcement officer and the test results indicate that a suspension of the privilege of operating a vessel on the waters of this state is required under this Code section, the results shall be reported to the department. Upon the receipt of a sworn report of the law enforcement officer that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the arrested person had been operating or was in actual physical control of a moving vessel upon the waters of this state in violation of section 8-6 or that such person had been operating or was in actual physical control of a moving vessel upon the waters of this state and was involved in a boating accident involving serious injuries or fatalities and that the person submitted to a chemical test at the request of the law enforcement officer and the test results indicate either an alcohol concentration of 0.10 grams or more or, for a person under the age of 21, an alcohol concentration of 0.02 grams or more, and the vessel being operated was a motorized vessel having ten or more horsepower or was a sailboat more than 12 feet in length, the department shall suspend the person's privilege to operate a vessel upon the waters of this state pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 52-7-12.6, subject to review as provided for in this Code section.

Upon the receipt of a sworn report of the law enforcement officer that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the arrested person had been operating or was in actual physical control of a moving vessel upon the waters of this state in violation of section 8-6 or that such person had been operating or was in actual physical control of a moving vessel upon the waters of this state and was involved in a boating accident which resulted in serious injuries or fatalities and that the person had refused to submit to the test upon the request of the law enforcement officer, and the vessel being operated was a motorized vessel having ten or more horsepower or was a sailboat more than 12 feet in length, the department shall suspend the person's privilege of operating a vessel on the waters of this state for a period of one year.
(f)

The law enforcement officer, acting on behalf of the department, shall personally serve the notice of intention to suspend or disqualify the privilege of operating a vessel on the waters of this state of the arrested person or other person refusing such test on such person at the time of the person's refusal to submit to a test or at the time at which such a test indicates that suspension or disqualification is required under this Code section. The officer shall forward to the department the notice of intent to suspend and the sworn report required by subsection (d) or (e) of this Code section within ten calendar days after the date of the arrest of such person. The failure of the officer to transmit the sworn report required by this Code section within ten calendar days shall not prevent the department from accepting such report and utilizing it in the suspension of an operator's privilege as provided in this Code section.
(2)
If notice has not been given by the arresting officer, the department, upon receipt of the sworn report of such officer, shall suspend the person's privilege to operate a vessel and, by regular mail, at the last known address, notify such person of such suspension.

Within 30 days after receiving a written request for a hearing, the department shall hold a hearing as is provided in Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act." The hearing shall be recorded.
(2)
The scope of the hearing shall be limited to the following issues:

(ii)
Whether the person was involved in a vessel accident or collision resulting in serious injury or fatality;
(B)
Whether at the time of the request for the test or tests the officer informed the person of the person's implied consent rights and the consequence of submitting or refusing to submit to such test and:

Whether a test or tests were administered and the results indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.10 grams or more or, for a person under the age of 21, an alcohol concentration of 0.02 grams or more; and
(C)
Whether the test or tests were properly administered by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Division of Forensic Sciences of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on an instrument approved by the Division of Forensic Sciences or a test conducted by the Division of Forensic Sciences, including whether the machine at the time of the test was operated with all its electronic and operating components prescribed by its manufacturer properly attached and in good working order, which shall be required. A copy of the operator's permit showing that the operator has been trained on the particular type of instrument used and one of the original copies of the test results or, where the test is performed by the Division of Forensic Sciences, a copy of the crime lab report shall satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph.
(3)
The hearing officer shall, within five calendar days after such hearing, forward a decision to the department to rescind or sustain the suspension of the person's privilege to operate a vessel on the waters of this state. If no hearing is requested within the ten business days specified in subsection (1) of this subsection, and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the person, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. The request for a hearing shall not stay the suspension of the person's privilege to operate a vessel on the waters of this state; provided, however, that if the hearing is timely requested and is not held within 60 days and the delay is not due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the person, the suspension shall be stayed until such time as the hearing is held and the hearing officer's decision is made.
(4)
In the event the person is acquitted of a violation of section 8-6 or such charge is initially disposed of other than by a conviction or plea of nolo contendere, then the suspension shall be terminated. An accepted plea of nolo contendere shall be entered on the operator's record and shall be considered and counted as a conviction for purposes of any future violations of section 8-6.
(h)
If the suspension is sustained after such a hearing, the person whose privilege to operate a vessel on the waters of this state has been suspended under this Code section shall have a right to file for a judicial review of the department's final decision, as provided for in Chapter 13 of Title 50, the "Georgia Administrative Procedure Act"; while such appeal is pending, the order of the department shall not be stayed.

When properly prepared and executed, as prescribed in this subsection, the certificate shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be self-authenticating, shall be admissible in any court of law, and shall satisfy the pertinent requirements of subsection (1) of subsection (c) of section 8-6 and subsection (g)(2)(C) of this Code section.

In the event the dockmaster determines that a violation justifies revocation, then the dockmaster shall notify the permit holder in writing of the revocation, giving the permit holder 48 hours from the effective time of notification to remove the vessel from the dock in compliance with the notification. The manner of notice shall be to hand deliver same to any person present upon the vessel or in the absence of any person by tacking of the notice in a conspicuous place upon the vessel, and notice shall be effective upon such delivery or tacking.
