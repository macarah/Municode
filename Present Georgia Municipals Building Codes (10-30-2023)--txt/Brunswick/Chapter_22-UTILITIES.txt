Sec. 22-7.1. - Water on separate meter used for landscape irrigation only.
(a)
Water conservation: All irrigation systems shall be designed, installed, maintained, altered, repaired, serviced, and operated in a manner that shall prevent the waste of water, promotes the most efficient use of water, and applies the least amount of water that is required to maintain healthy individual plant material or turf and control erosion.
(b)
Definitions: As used in this section the following words shall mean:
Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gasses, or other substances into the distribution pipes of the utility's potable supply of water from any source or sources.
Backflow prevention assembly means an assembly used to prevent backflow into the utility's potable water system. The type of assembly used should be based on the degree of hazard or pollution which may impair or have an adverse effect on the quality of potable water.
(c)
Application: All users of the water of the unified system shall submit an application to the director, or his designee, for the installation of separate meter for landscape or irrigation purposes. The application must be completed, submitted and approved by the director prior to installation. The director, or his designee, may not approve the application for an irrigation meter when the existing water main does not provide sufficient water volume or pressure to support the demand of an irrigation system without causing unacceptably low water pressure for other customers on the same water main, or when installation of the meter would cause a situation which is likely to create an imminent hazard to the utility's water distribution system. No meter will be issued when the utility determines, based on USGS geological study results, that the Floridan Aquifer, or any other aquifer, supplying the water to the customer is in distress.
(d)
Fees, rates and charges; billing: The costs associated with installing a landscape or irrigation meter shall be set forth in the utility's rate resolution, as amended from time to time. A monthly bill will be provided to customers itemizing irrigation only meters.
(e)
Equipment and maintenance:
(1)
All automatic sprinkler systems shall be equipped with a functioning rain sensor/shut-off device that ensures the automatic irrigation system will not operate during time of precipitation. Rain sensors shall be adjusted and set so that they automatically shut off the irrigation system after one-fourth inch of rainfall or more has occurred. No person shall adjust either the rain sensor or the irrigation system so that the rain sensor is not able to override and turn off the irrigation system after one-fourth inch of rain has fallen.
(2)
Irrigation heads shall be adjusted as to prevent water from landing on impervious surfaces including, but not limited to, sidewalks, driveways, streets.
(3)
Backflow prevention assemblies shall be installed to ensure protection of the potable water supply and tested annually by a certified backflow technician to ensure proper operation. The results of the test shall be submitted to the director, or his designee, within ten working days of the customer receiving the inspection report.
(f)

During water emergencies, irrigation systems shall only be allowed to operate during times as set forth either by the State of Georgia or the utility.
(g)
Discontinuance of service: Service may be discontinued for any one of the following reasons:
(1)
For misrepresentation in the application as to property fixtures to be supplied or the use to be made of the water supply;
(2)
For the use of water for any other property or purpose than that described in the application;
(3)
For waste of water through improperly sized pipes, fixture or otherwise;
(4)
For failure to keep the connections, service lines or fixtures in good repair;
(5)
For nonpayment of account for irrigation meter service or of any scheduled related fee or charge;
(6)
For tampering with any service pipe, meter, curb stop, or any other appliance of the utility controlling or regarding the water supply;
(7)

(d)
The quantity of water registered by a meter shall be conclusive on both the water customer and the utility, except when the meter has been found to be registering inaccurately, or has ceased to register. In the latter case, the quantity may be determined by the average registration of the meter when in order. In case of a disputed account involving the accuracy of a meter, such meter shall be tested upon request of the customer in conformity with the usual standards or methods of testing meters. In the event that the meter so tested is found to have an error in registration of three percent or more, the customer's bill will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the meter is removed at the customer's request and for the purpose of testing its accuracy, a fee as established from time to time by the utility will be assessed if the meter proves to be accurate to current American Water Works Association standards. If the meter registers outside said standards, then no charge will be assessed, the customer's bill will be adjusted, and a new meter installed.
(e)
If the water meter is repaired or replaced for reasons, other than failure due to normal usage, resulting from neglect or some act of the customer or owner of the property served, then the cost of the repairs will be charged to the customer.

ARTICLE II. - COMMERCIAL WASTE HANDLING (FATS, OILS AND GREASE)

Sec. 22-21. - Purpose.
(a)
Excessive amounts of fats, oils, grease, grit, sand and other solid or viscous materials can cause blockage and obstruction in the sanitary sewer system causing untreated wastewater to overflow into the environment. Much of the waste material that has the potential to cause blockage or obstruction originates from commercial facilities, such as food preparation and vehicle maintenance facilities. This chapter sets forth minimum and uniform requirements for the treatment and disposal of commercial waste into the sanitary sewer system, and the transportation and ultimate disposal of commercial waste sludge and byproducts.
(b)
The objective of this chapter is:
(1)
To minimize the discharge of pollutants associated with commercial waste discharged into the sanitary sewer system that may interfere with normal operation of the system; and
(2)
To assure that the sludge and byproducts removed from commercial waste treatment systems are transported and disposed of in accordance with Chapter 391-3-6-.24 of the rules and regulations of the EPD.

Sec. 22-37. - Local discharge limits.
Using EPA approved methodology, the utility has established local discharge limits for the pollutants of concern to the POTW. These limits are designed to protect the receiving stream, prevent interference with POTW operations and protect the quality of the sludge produced by the POTW. These limits apply to all users of the system. For industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, the local limit will be compared to the categorical limit and the lower value will be used. The utility reserves the right to set higher discharge limits for individual industrial users provided that the following conditions apply:
(a)
There are no other industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern or if there are other significant industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern they are discharging below the established limit;
(b)
If any other significant industrial users are discharging the pollutant of concern they agree to accept a lower limit; and
(c)
The total combined loading on the POTW will not exceed the established maximum head works loading.
(1)
A user which desires to have a higher local discharge limit should petition the director in writing.
(2)
Any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of conventional pollutants above the local discharge limit will be subject to surcharges as provided in the current rate resolution. For purposes of this article conventional pollutants are considered biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and oil and grease.
(3)
All other regulated pollutants are considered non-conventional pollutants and any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of these pollutant(s) above the local discharge limit will be subject to an enforcement action as provided in this article.
(d)
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The utility may impose mass limitations on industrial users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Sec. 22-38. - National categorical pretreatment standards.
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 C.F.R. Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are incorporated herein by reference.

(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Sec. 22-39. - Pretreatment of wastewater.
(a)
Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section [22-36] of this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State of Georgia, or the director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be acceptable to the director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the utility under the provisions of this chapter.
(b)
Additional pretreatment measures.
(1)
Whenever deemed necessary, the utility may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sanitary waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(2)
The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on his or her own property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
(3)
The utility may, upon notification, require users to install a suitable control manhole together with the necessary meters and other appurtenances to facilitate the observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's expense, and shall be maintained by the owner in a safe and accessible condition at all times.
(4)
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(c)
Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the utility shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The utility may require a user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by subsection [22-42(g)] of this chapter; and
[4]
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.
(d)
Hauled waste.
(1)
Hauled waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the director, and at such times as are established by the director. The director may require haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. Such permits may be revoked at any time if, in the opinion of the director, continued dumping of such matter into the sewers will be injurious to the sewer system or treatment processes.
(2)
A charge shall be made for the privilege of dumping hauled waste. A record shall be kept of such dumps and statements rendered at the first of each month, the amount of such statements shall be payable within ten days after rendition. Failure to pay the amounts due within such ten-day period shall be cause for revoking the permit.
(3)
The director may require generators of hauled waste to obtain permits. The director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled waste into the POTW.
(4)
The director may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.

(j)
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1)
A user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. Notifications of changed conditions, however, must be submitted under subsection (f), above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsection [22-41(b)(1)] and subsection [22-43(a)(1)] of this chapter.
(2)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
In the cases of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the utility, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and Georgia Hazardous Waste Department authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
(4)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(5)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
(k)
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain then sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(l)
Sample collection.
(1)
Except as indicated in paragraph (2) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the utility may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(m)
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(n)
Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, name of the person(s) taking the samples, the date(s) analysis was performed, who performed the analysis, the analytical techniques or methods used, and the results of such analysis. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years.

Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed, by any magnitude, a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defend by 40 C.F.R. 403(1).
(b)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
(c)
Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement that the utility determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public.
(d)
Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the human health, welfare or to the environment, or has resulted in the utility's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
(e)
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance.
(f)
Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.
(g)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
(h)
Any other violation(s) which the utility determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Sec. 22-46. - Service charges.
The utility may adopt charges and fees, which may include:
(a)
Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the utility's pretreatment program.
(b)
Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures.
(c)
Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction.
(d)
Fees for permit applications.
(e)
Fees for filing appeals.
(f)
Fees for consistent removal by the utility of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards.
(g)
Other fees as the utility may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein.

(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Sec. 22-47. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
(a)
Notification of violation. When the utility finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director, or his designee, may serve upon said user written notice of violation by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Within ten days of the receipt date of the notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the director, or his designee. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the utility to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The director is authorized to enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with a user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to subsection (d), below, and shall be judicially enforceable.
(c)
Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user including, but not limited to, immediate enforcement action.
(d)
Compliance order. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or a permit or order issued thereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time period. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may contain such other requirements to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(e)
Cease and desist order. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct the user to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(f)
Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, when the utility finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge.
(1)
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after ten calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of seven percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of seven percent per month. A lien against the user's real property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties provided the owner of such real property is the person who incurred the charges.
(2)
Users desiring to dispute administrative fines must file a written request with the director seeking reconsideration of the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. When the director determines a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receipt of such request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment shall be returned to the user without interest.
(3)
The utility may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(g)
Emergency suspensions.
(1)
The director may immediately suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit of a user when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment.
(2)
A user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals or the environment. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings set forth in subsection (h), below, are initiated against the user. A user who is the subject of a suspension order shall have the right to appeal to the director from such suspension, but such suspension shall remain in full force and effect pending such hearing and the decision of the director.
(3)
A user who is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (c), above, or subsection (h), below.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension.
(h)
Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the utility. A user who violates the following conditions of this chapter or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or any applicable state or federal law, is subject to permit termination:
(1)
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, or wastewater constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5)
Repeatedly violates this chapter.
Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c), above, why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the utility shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(i)
Termination of services. The director may order a user who violates, or continues to violate, this chapter, or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW, to show cause before the director as to why termination of services should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the director regarding the termination of services, the reasons why the action is to be taken, and directing the user to show cause before the director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation.
(1)
The director may take evidence and hear witnesses.
(2)
After the director has reviewed the evidence, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly installed and/or operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
Exercise of this option by the utility shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Sec. 22-48. - Judicial remedies.
When a user discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article, or violates, or continues to violate, any order or permit issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in a court having jurisdiction over such matters.
(a)
Injunctive relief. When the utility finds a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or any order or permit issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may petition the court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The utility may seek also such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user including, but not limited to, nuisance abatement proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(b)
Civil penalties.
(1)
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or any order or permit issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the utility for a civil penalty of up to $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of violation. In addition to the above described penalty, the utility may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the POTW and utility, and any economic benefit gained through the user's violation.
(2)
The utility shall petition a court of competent jurisdiction to impose, assess, and recover such sums set forth in subsection (b)(1), above. In determining the amount of liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(c)
Criminal prosecution.
(1)
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, any orders or permits issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both.
(2)
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available to the utility.
(3)
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both.
(d)
Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. The director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Sec. 22-49. - Supplemental enforcement remedies.
(a)
Liability insurance. The director may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with any provision of this article, or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the industrial user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge.
(b)
Water supply severance. When an industrial user has been found after hearing to be in violation of any provision of this article, or an order issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Sec. 22-50. - Affirmative defenses.
(a)
Treatment upsets.
(1)
For the purposes of this article, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3), below, are met.
(3)
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
a.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
b.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
c.
The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
1.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
2.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
3.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5)
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6)
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(b)
Treatment bypass.
(1)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection (b).
(2)
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, then it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
a.
A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
b.
The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(3)
Bypass is prohibited. The director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a.
The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage including, but not limited to, substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not include economic loss caused by delays in production;
b.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
c.
The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (2) of this subsection (b).
d.
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (b)(3)a—c. of this section.
(c)
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section [22-36] of this chapter, except for subsections [22-36(d)(1), (2) and (9)] of this chapter, if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the utility was regularly in compliance with its NPDES and/or LAS permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010)
Secs. 22-51—22-60. - Reserved.
ARTICLE IV. - RATES AND FEES

Sec. 22-61. - User charge system.
(a)
Charges for water service and for wastewater service shall be made and billed in compliance with the user charge system approved by the utility with adjusted rates herein established; except, however, the utility may suspend or forego the imposition and collection of connection/capital tap fees at any time when determined to be in the best interests of utility. The user charge system shall be:
(1)
A base rate shall be charged based on the administration and debt costs and shall be calculated based on the number of water and wastewater customers and the assignment of REUs. Every customer connected to the utility system will pay a base rate each month regardless of usage;
(2)
A consumption rate shall be charged based on the metered volume of water used by each water and each wastewater customer for the operation, maintenance, and replacement costs incurred by the utility to be calculated on the basis of gallons of water measured; and
(3)
Water and wastewater tap fees consists of two components, connection/capital tap fees and installation/operational tap fees. The customer at whose request for connection is made shall pay all fees and charges at the time an official request is made or at the time application is made for a building or plumbing permit, as applicable, and subject to the exception in paragraph (a), above. All tap fees are payable to the utility.
a.
The connection/capital tap fee shall be calculated and charged on the basis of REUs. Any fractional units resulting from the calculation of REUs shall be treated as a whole unit.
b.
The installation/operational tap fee shall be charged in accordance with schedules listed in the utility's current rate resolution. Installation/operational tap fees shall apply only to installations on mains that are adjacent to the location to be served; for any extensions necessary beyond this condition the actual costs shall be charged in addition to connection/capital tap fees and installation/operational tap fees.
(b)
A user who discharges any toxic pollutants or other constituents which causes an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the aforementioned treatment works shall be required to pay for such increased costs. A surcharge will be applied to the overall strength of commercial or industrial wastewater based on the strength and volume of such wastes and the costs of treatment thereof.
(c)
The utility shall review not less often than every two years water consumption and wastewater contribution of users, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the water and sewer systems, and the approved user charge system. The utility may revise the charges for users to accomplish the following:
(1)
Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs among users;
(2)
Generate sufficient revenue to pay debt service, administrative costs, and total operation and maintenance costs necessary for proper operation and maintenance (including minor replacement) of the water and sewer systems; and
(3)
Generate reserve fund contributions for emergency and/or capital planning requirements.
(d)
The user charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts between the utility and users which are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 204(b)(1)(a) of the Act and 40 C.F.R. Part 35.
(e)
The utility may collect samples for the purpose of determining surcharge and compliance, and may charge the industrial user for this service.
(1)
The utility may require industrial users to sample and test at their own expense for the purposes of determining surcharges and permit compliance.
(2)
In the event of a disagreement in results between samples collected by the industrial user and the utility, the utility results will prevail unless it can be proven that there was an error in utility sampling or testing protocol.
(f)
Where a user has a private water source and discharges into the utility sanitary sewer system, said user shall be required to install a proper water flow measuring device and pay the user charges for sewer service in an amount equal to the amount charged if all water used was purchased from the utility, unless an accurate wastewater flow measuring device is installed, in which case the bill will be based on the wastewater meter.
(g)
Timing of billing. Water and/or sewer charges shall accrue on a monthly basis from the date of connection and will be billed monthly thereafter.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010; Ord. No. 1020, § 1, 11-17-2010; Ord. No. 1066, § 2, 12-18-2019)
Sec. 22-62. - Other rates, fees and charges.
(a)
Charges for water and sewer service, tap fees, and other related fees and deposits or letters of credit, established in a rate resolution by the utility, will be as follows:
(1)
When service has been cut-off for nonpayment or other action resulting in unauthorized use, service shall not be restored until the unpaid bill, either at the present location or at any previous location at which service was supplied to the applicant, and the service fees provided by the rate resolution are satisfied, including the following cumulative fees for each action taken to prevent unauthorized use of utility services:
a.
Turn-on after a delinquent cut-off.
b.
Locking meter.
c.
Removal of meter.
d.
Removal of straight line.
e.
Removal of unauthorized relocated meter.
f.
Cutting off water at main.
(2)
Payment of the fees in paragraph (1) above shall not exempt a user from any civil or criminal action resulting from violations of this chapter.
(b)
In addition to the fees and deposits, each applicant for service shall pay in advance an account establishment charge for either new service or transfer of service from one location to another.
(c)
Connection fees and deposits for a facility will be based on the facility's REUs. The amount of REUs is determined by the flow characteristics as set forth in the REU table of the utility's rate resolution, as amended from time to time. In the case of existing facilities with an increase in REUs, additional fees and charges will be due.
(d)
Deposits will be required for all customer accounts. The deposit may increase by a factor of 250 percent if the customer has a history of three or more issuances of non-sufficient funds payments, cut-offs for non-payment, or an account with the utility which has been turned over to collections in the previous 24 months. A deposit will be refunded upon termination of service; provided, however, any deposit for water and/or sewer service connected to the system by an individual meter will be automatically credited to the customer's account upon written request after 36 months of consecutive timely payments for accounts in good standing, as set forth under the criteria in the utility's rate resolution, for a single family residential account or 60 months for non-residential accounts. All credits will be the actual amount paid as a deposit. No interest will be paid on deposits for refunding purposes.
(e)
The utility may refuse to supply service to any customer if there is a delinquent account for water and/or sewer service until the bill for all prior charges billed to that customer both at the present location or at a previous location have been paid by the customer owing the outstanding amount.
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010; Ord. No. 1038, § 4, 1-7-2014; Ord. No. 1066, § 3, 12-18-2019)
Sec. 22-63. - Leak adjustments in water and sewer billing.
The utility recognizes that occasionally water service lines may develop hidden leaks, leading to unusually high water bills. The utility encourages customers to make prompt and permanent repairs while showing consideration for unusual circumstances without burdening the utility's other customers with the expenses of an individual customer's lost water. Accordingly, the utility, under certain circumstances, provides customers the opportunity to request a leak adjustment in their water and/or sewer bill.
(a)
For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
(1)
"Physical damage" means damage to a facility or equipment supplying water to the premises and the damage:
a.
Is not visible or detectable in the customer's premises except upon excavation or some other disturbance of the property; and
b.
Is not the result of an act of the customer, or of any agent or contractor hired by the customer.
(2)
"[Unusually] high water bill" means a water and/or sewer bill for a particular month that reflects monthly water usage, in whatever units measured, that is at least two times the customer's average monthly usage of the premises as measured during the previous 12 monthly billing periods.
(b)
The customer retains control over the use of water on the customer's premises, and as such, the customer is responsible for all the water passing through the meter, including water which may be lost or wasted through leaking pipes or fixtures on the premises. The customer is responsible for monitoring for unusually high water usage as reflected on the customer's bill. The customer must promptly investigate any unusually high water bills. A customer is required to repair any water leak promptly, and the customer is responsible for all repair costs.
(c)
A customer may seek an adjustment under this chapter to an unusually high water bill caused by physical damage to the customer's water service line.
(d)
A customer is not eligible for a leak adjustment to an unusually high water bill due to circumstances not caused by an undetected leak, leaks that should reasonably have been discovered, high usage caused by negligence or failure to properly maintain pools or water using/consuming items or usage from appliances whether or not operating properly.
(e)
A customer seeking a water bill adjustment must provide written notice to the director, or his designee within 90 days of the completion of the repair. The written notice/request shall contain the following information:
(1)
The name, address, and telephone number of the customer reporting the leak;
(2)
A description of how the leak was discovered;
(3)
The date the leak was discovered;
(4)
The nature and location of the leak;
(5)
The date the leak was repaired; and
(6)
A description of the repair work completed.
The customer shall provide any other information, documents, or access requested by the director as may be necessary or appropriate for investigating the circumstances of any alleged leak and/or related repairs and verifying the customer's eligibility for an adjustment.
(f)
The adjustment period for undetected leaks cannot exceed one regular meter reading period, unless (i) the meter reading was missed during the leak period, or (ii) the leak affected two connective bills.
(g)
If the director, or his designee, determines, upon investigation, that a customer is eligible for a leak adjustment, then the director, or his designee, is authorized to adjust the unusually high water bill as follows:
(1)
The customer shall be responsible for half of the increase above the customer's average monthly consumption for both water and sewer service charges, as calculated by averaging the prior 12 months bills before the leak, or any portion of the prior 12 months if the customer has fewer than 12 previous bills.
(2)
The customer may pay the adjusted water and/or sewer bill in equal payments over a 12-month billing period in addition to the regular applicable monthly billing.
(3)
No late fees will be applied to the balance during the repayment period.
(4)
No adjustments will be made to the portions of the bill representing the fixed charges such as, for example, debt service.
(5)
Customers who have irrigated new sod on their property, have repaired irrigation system leaks or have filled a pool may request removal of all sewer charges above the customer's average monthly consumption once per calendar year as calculated by averaging the prior 12 months bills or any portion of the prior 12 months if the customer has fewer than 12 previous bills. Up to two consecutive billings periods may be adjusted.
