An animal may be considered under control if the owner is accompanying the animal and has voice, whistle, or other control over such animal and such animal is trained to respond to such voice, whistle, or other control. The burden of providing that an animal is trained to respond to voice, whistle, or other control remains with the owner of such animal and a rebuttal presumption exists that an animal which is not confined to the premises of its owner without being secured by a chain, leash, or lead of sufficient strength or fence to prevent it from escaping is not under control of its owner.
Unsanitary means and involves conditions such as, but not limited to, filth and bacteria which endanger the health of humans and/or animals.
