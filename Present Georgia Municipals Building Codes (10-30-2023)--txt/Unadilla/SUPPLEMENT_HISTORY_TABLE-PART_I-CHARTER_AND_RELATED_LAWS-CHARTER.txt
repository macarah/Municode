CHARTER
FOOTNOTE(S):
(1) Editor's noteâ€” Printed herein is 1977 Ga. Laws, page 3079 which provides a charter for the city. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.
