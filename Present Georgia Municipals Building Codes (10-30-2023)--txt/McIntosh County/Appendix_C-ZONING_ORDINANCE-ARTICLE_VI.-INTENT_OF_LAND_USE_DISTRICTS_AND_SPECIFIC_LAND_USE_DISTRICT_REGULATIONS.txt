S.
Occupational License. All parks must obtain an occupational license from McIntosh County to operate as a business. In addition there shall be a charge of $50.00 per parking lot per year, paid at the time the occupational license is renewed, paid to McIntosh County by the park owner.

Section 17. - WVO, Waterfront View Overlay District.

Housing design standards are enforced to ensure that only the more structurally sound dwellings are placed in this area. Also due to the amount of revenue such waterfront properties provide to the tax base of the county, it is in the public interest that property values are well maintained in these areas.
