ARTICLE V. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Section 1. - Suitability of the Land.
Land subject to flooding, improper or inadequate drainage or erosion, if developed as proposed, and any land deemed unsuitable for development due to steep slopes, unsuitable soils, subsurface conditions or other undesirable properties, shall not be subjected to development as a lot within a Subdivision for any uses that shall or may create or continue such conditions or increase danger to health, safety, life, or property. In particular, no land within any delineated floodways or within any required undisturbed buffer shall be included within the Buildable Area of any Subdivision or included within any Lot of a Subdivision. In addition, no undisturbed buffer that is required by any of the local development codes and ordinances in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community shall be included or within any Lot proposed for a Subdivision for any development.
Section 2. - Appropriateness of Location.
The Building and Zoning Administrator and the Planning Commission must consider the following when making a recommendation for approval of a subdivision:
A.
Whether the subdivision is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property;
B.
Whether the subdivision will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property;
C.
Whether the land to be subdivided has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned and in its existing use;
D.
Whether the subdivision will cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools;
E.
Whether the subdivision is in conformity with the policy and intent of the County's Comprehensive Land Use Plan;
F.
Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the subdivision;
G.
Whether the subdivision can be considered environmentally adverse to the natural resources, environment and citizens of McIntosh County.
Section 3. - Differences in Ordinances.
Whenever there is a difference between minimum standards or requirements under the regulations set forth in this Ordinance and those contained in any applicable zoning regulations, development regulations, building codes or other ordinances or regulations, the most restrictive shall apply.
Section 4. - Conformance.
All proposed subdivisions must conform to the adopted Comprehensive Plan of McIntosh County.
Section 5. - Access.
When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such lots shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
No subdivision should be designed so as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. Every development should be designed to facilitate access to adjoining properties, which are developed or anticipated to be developed in a manner compatible with or substantially similar to the subject property. Locations of inter-parcel access shall be as required by and subject to the approval of McIntosh County. Private streets, as may be approved under the provisions of this Ordinance, shall be constructed to the roadway standards of McIntosh County.
Section 6. - Public and/or Community Utility Requirements.
By permitting varying numbers of lots and varying levels of improvement, regulations enable the small developer to provide for growth in the rural, more slowly developing areas of the county characterized by a lower lot absorption rate. Less restrictive development standards are imposed according to quantity of lots to allow for flexibility in subdivision sizes. All subdivisions are required to abide by the requirements of the McIntosh County Subdivision Ordinance, Water Resources Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, and Flood Damage Protection Ordinance, and applicable provisions of the Development Standards.

Step 2:â€‚The developer shall submit to McIntosh County two complete sets of the Construction Plan Application Package.
Step 3:â€‚The Construction Plan Application Package shall be carefully checked by the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator or designated development coordinator to determine whether or not it is complete. If it is incomplete it will be returned to the developer with an explanation of why it is incomplete and what must be done to make it complete. The developer will then begin the process again with Step 2, and no additional fee will be required.
Step 4:â€‚If the Construction Plan Application Package is complete, it will be accepted by the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator or designated development coordinator; the date of acceptance will be noted. For every submittal, the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator and County Engineer shall have at least 30 working days for review of the Construction Plans, and preparing comments.
Step 5:â€‚The McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator and County Engineer shall approve two identical sets of plans, one for the developer and one for the County. The developer shall then make five copies of the approved set for the County, along with one 11â€³Ã—17â€³ set. The developer shall keep one copy of the approved set on the construction site at all times.
Step 6:â€‚Upon request, after approval on the Construction Plans and receipt of all permits and approvals under Section 2, Item I of this Article, which shall become a part of the developer's Construction Plans, the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator shall issue a Development Permit to install the erosion control facilities and the tree-save fence in accordance with the approved plans. A fee is required for this permit in accordance with the fee schedule set by McIntosh County.
Step 7:â€‚The County staff or appointees may periodically inspect the property to determine whether or not the site is developed in accordance with the approved plans. Also, the developer shall submit for review and approval all test results, documentation, and certifications that are required to demonstrate satisfactory construction and adherence to all federal, state, or local regulatory agency permits and approvals, all codes, ordinances and development standards.
Step 13[8]:â€‚Upon receipt of written notification from the development, the County staff shall make a final inspection of the construction. On the basis of the site inspection and the review of the supporting documentation, the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator and County Engineer shall determine whether or not the construction work is acceptable. This determination shall be made within ten working days of the request. If it is determined that the construction is satisfactory, the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator will authorize the preparation of a Final Plat.
Step 14[9]:â€‚If the construction is not approved, the developer shall be informed in writing of what needs to be done to secure approval, and then begin the process again with Step 13. A re-inspection fee shall be required.
Note: If the developer wishes to make any change to the Construction Plans at any time during the process, that change must first be approved by the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator and County Engineer in accordance with the Construction Plan Review Process.

A maintenance plan submitted to the provisions of the Ownership and Management Plan provided for under Section 5.5 Subsection C of this Article XII, shall be required in order for any density bonus to be considered. The McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator may request the review of a density request under this subsection by a registered landscape architect and/or professional engineer.
ii.
The number of lots approved up to the maximum permitted five (5) percent shall be based on the applicant's demonstration of cost to implement subsection (i) above versus the value of additional lots to offset such cost.
iii.
Approval of the extent of the environmental protection density bonus allowed for a given conservation Subdivision shall be made by the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator, based on the extent to which the bonus is consistent with the purposes and requirements of this Article XII.
c.
Combining Density Bonus Provisions. If both bonus provisions can be met, and are approved by the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator, a total density bonus of up to and including, but not more than, ten (10) may be added to the yield plan. Said bonus shall be a minimum of one dwelling unit.
3.2. Maximum Lot Guarantee.
The maximum number of lots calculation does in no way guarantee that the conservation subdivision will be approved with the maximum number of lots. If all other requirements are met, the conservation subdivision may have up to (and not exceeding) the maximum number of lots plus and density bonus approved by the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator.
3.3. Minimum Lot Area.

A.
Site Plan: As part of an overall concept site plan including a golf course, the Applicant shall prepare a golf course concept plan. The golf course concept plan shall be prepared for submission to [insert local government] that shows the proposed layout of the golf course. This plan should include the following:
a.
Tees, greens, fairways, and practice range;
b.
Buildings (e.g., clubhouse, maintenance facilities, etc.);
c.
Roads and parking lots;
d.
Conceptual design for the management of stormwater runoff and water quality including locations and methods and documentation that these locations and methods are practical; and
e.
Location of irrigation wells and/or ponds.
f.
The golf course should be designed to avoid, to the extent practical, encroachments on the protected areas restricted from development and to minimize the impact of the overall site development on natural resources.
A.
Variances to Buffer Standards: If any of the above facilities would require encroachment on vegetative buffers, streams, wetlands or floodplains, a variance of the standards must be granted by the EPD and McIntosh County Planning and Zoning Board as applicable. Any variance must meet the following conditions:
a.
Fairways should be sited to reduce the number of stream crossings. Crossings should be limited to a maximum of two (2) for each 1,000 feet of stream length.
b.
Fairways should be sited to eliminate or minimize the need to clear forest on steep or erodible slopes.
c.
Clearing of forest canopy and conversion of forested wetlands to shrub-scrub or emergent wetlands should be minimized where practical.
d.
Fairways will not require filling or grading in buffers, wetlands, or floodplains.
e.
Where lack of topographic relief requires clear cutting of trees, this may be permitted; however, that portion of the fairway in the buffer, wetlands, or floodplains must be maintained as an unplayable rough. The vegetation will be maintained as shrub-scrub or herbaceous with a concentration of shrubs and small trees along the stream banks to provide shading and stream bank stability.
f.
Cart paths will be timber, and timber pilings, (no wider than 6 to 8 feet in width) where they cross wetlands. Cart paths will not be located along steep or erodible slopes. Minimal clearing will be allowed.
g.
Buildings and parking lots will not be located in stream buffers, wetlands, or floodplains.
h.
Stormwater and water quality management facilities will not be located in stream buffers, wetlands, or floodplains.
B.
Ponds: Ponds constructed for irrigation water supply or as hazards shall address applicable impacts including changes in organic material transport; invertebrate drift; fish passage; and loss of wetland functions. If site characteristics are such that one or more of these conditions is not applicable, a statement to that effect shall be provided with reference to the source of that determination.
C.
Forest Cover; The Applicant should determine the percentage of the total site acreage that is forest cover. The design of the golf course should limit clearing of forest to 25% of the total on-site forest acreage. If the design requires that more than 25% of the existing forest be cleared, an afforestation (i.e., artificial planting) program must be implemented to replace any acreage over the clearing limit. A reforestation in other parts of the watershed may be accepted to meet the percent forest cover requirements.
D.
Where state or federal plant and/or animal habitat are determined to exist on site, the applicant will design the golf course to preserve these areas.
E.
Surface Water Monitoring: The applicant will be required to conduct surface water monitoring for one (1) year prior to release of grading permits and for three (3) years after the start-up of golf course operations. This monitoring program will be developed in coordination with EPD. The monitoring plan and the data collected for the three years post-construction shall be submitted the McIntosh County Building and Zoning Administrator.
F.
Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPM): The Applicant will develop in coordination with EPD an IPM Plan. Emphasis will be given to: 1) selection of drought and disease resistant grass species for fairways, tees and greens; 2) the use of biological controls instead of chemicals; 3) where pesticides are used, selection of those chemicals that are less toxic, less mobile and have a shorter half-life; 4) strict control over those pesticides in terms of location of application; and 5) identification of areas on a site that are particularly susceptible to ground water or surface water contamination. The IPM plan must include the contact information for the person(s) responsible for it implementation.
G.
Ground Water Protection: Greens and tees should be located in areas where the maximum high water is greater than two feet below the surface. Field determination of ground water should be conducted with respect to the final grading of those locations.
