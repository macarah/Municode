ARTICLE XI. - SPECIAL PERMIT USES, VARIANCES, APPEALS, AND ENFORCEMENT

Section 1. - Special Permit Uses.
The uses listed under the various land use zoning districts as "special permit uses" are so classified because they more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other uses which are called permitted uses. Special permit uses are uses which would not normally be appropriate in a district unless strictly controlled as to size, lot coverage, impact on public services, visibility, traffic and other such characteristics. The following procedure is established to integrate the special permit uses with other land uses located in the district. These uses shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following procedure:
1.1.
When applying for a building permit, the applicant shall be informed by the Building and Zoning Administrator that the proposed use is a Special Permit Uses. The matter will then be referred to the Planning Commission.
1.2.
An application for special permit use shall be filed with the Building and Zoning Administrator at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the County Planning Commission. Such application shall contain all information requested and any other material or information pertinent to the request which the Planning Commission may require, and shall contain the notation of the Building and Zoning Administrator that the appropriate fee has been paid to McIntosh County.
1.3.
Required Public Hearings. No official action shall be taken on any proposed Special Permit unless one (1) public hearing has been held. The public hearing shall be conducted by the Planning Commission.
1.4.
Procedure for Calling a Public Hearing.
A.
Prior to scheduling required public hearings, applicants shall complete all submission requirements provided by the Building and Zoning Inspector (e.g., forms, fees, deeds, maps, etc.).
B.
The Building and Zoning Inspector shall then notify the applicant of the date, time, and place of the required public hearing.
C.
At least 15, but not more than 45 days prior to scheduled public hearings, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall publish in the newspaper of general circulation, notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing.
D.
Not less than 15 days prior to the date of a public hearing, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall post in a conspicuous location on the property in question a sign which shall contain information regarding the proposed Special Permit; specifically the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing.
E.
The primary goal of conducting public hearings on proposed special permit shall be to solicit pertinent factual information which will be beneficial in helping the Planning Commission judge the merits of each specific proposed special permit.
1.5.
Action of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may approve the application as requested, or it may require conditions for approval, or it may deny the application. A Special Use Permit may be granted by the Planning Commission only if the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that:
A.
Neither the proposed use nor the proposed site upon which the use will be located is of such a character that the use will have significant adverse impact upon the value or quiet possession of surrounding properties greater than would normally occur from generally permitted uses in the zoning district. In reaching a determination on this standard, the Planning Commission shall consider:
1.
The size of the proposed use compared with the surrounding uses;
2.
The intensity of the proposed use, including amount to be generated, hours of operation, expanse of pavement, and similar measures of intensity of use, compared with surrounding uses;
3.
The potential generation of noise, dust, odor, vibration, glare, smoke, litter and other nuisances;
4.
Unusual physical characteristics of the site, including size of the lot, shape of the lot, topography, and soils, which may tend to aggravate adverse impacts upon surrounding properties;
5.
The degree to which landscaping, fencing and other design elements have been incorporated to mitigate adverse impacts on surrounding properties.
B.
County or other facilities serving the proposed use will not be overburdened or hazards created because of inadequate facilities. In reaching a determination on this standard, the commission shall consider:
1.
The ability of the traffic to safely move into and out of the site at the proposed location;
2.
The presence of facilities to assure the safety of pedestrians passing by or through the site;
3.
The capacity of the street network to accommodate the proposed use;
4.
The capacity of the sewerage and water supply systems to accommodate the proposed use;
5.
The capacity of the storm drainage system to accommodate the proposed use;
6.
The ability of the fire department to provide necessary protection services to the site and development.
C.
The natural characteristics of the site, including topography, drainage, and relationship to ground and surface waters and floodplain, shall not be such that the proposed use when placed on the site will cause undue harm to the environment or to neighboring properties.
1.6.
Denial of Special Permits. If the decision of the Planning Commission is to deny the Special Permit, then the same property may not again be considered for a Special Permit until the expiration of at least six (6) months immediately following the defeat of the Special Permit by the Planning Commission.
1.7.
Appeals of Decision. Appeals of the Planning Commission decision shall go to Board of Appeals. A written appeal must be submitted to the Building and Zoning Administrator within 15 days.
1.8.
Conditions of Special Uses.
A.
Upon consideration of the standards listed above the Planning Commission may require, such conditions, in addition to those required by other provisions of this Ordinance, as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with those standards and all other applicable requirements of this Ordinance. Violation of any of those conditions shall be a violation of this Ordinance. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, specifications for: type of landscaping/vegetation, increased setbacks and yards, specified sewage disposal and water supply facilities, hours of operation, operational controls, professional inspection and maintenance, sureties, location of piers, docks, parking and signs, and types of construction.
Section 2. - Variances.
2.1.
The Planning Commission may authorize a variance from the requirements of this ordinance where it can be shown that owing to special and unusual circumstances related to a specific lot, strict application of the ordinance would cause an undue or unnecessary hardship. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized within the zone in which the proposed use would be located. In granting a variance, the Planning Commission may attach conditions which it finds necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or vicinity and otherwise achieve the purposes of this ordinance.
2.2.
Conditions Governing the Granting of a Variance. A variance may be granted by the Planning Commission only in the event that all of the following circumstances exist:
A.
Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances apply to the property which do not apply to other properties in the same zone or vicinity, and result from lot size or shape, topography, or other circumstances over which the owners of property since enactment of this ordinance have had no control.
B.
The variance is necessary to provide the applicant the same basic property rights that other property owners in the same zone or vicinity possess.
C.
The variance would not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this ordinance, or to property in the same zone or vicinity in which the property is located, or otherwise conflict with the objectives of any county plan or policy.
D.
The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the hardship.
2.3.
Procedure for Taking Action on a Variance Application. Variances shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following procedure:

B.
The Planning Commission shall hold one or more public hearings thereon.
C.
The Planning Commission shall render its decision on the application and notify the applicant within five days of that decision.

The Building Administrator shall monitor variances to ensure compliance with this section.
Section 3. - Official Zoning Map Interpretation.
3.1.

All decisions rendered in this regard by the Planning Commission shall be based upon the criteria set forth in Section 402 of this Ordinance.
Section 4. - Violations.
4.1.
Any person violating any provisions of this ordinance shall be guilty of misdemeanor. Each day the violation continues, it constitutes a separate offense and will be treated as such. In case any building, structure, or land is used, erected, repaired, converted, or maintained in violation of this ordinance, the building inspector or any other appropriate authority, or any county resident who would be damaged by such violation, may institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action to prevent the use of the building, structure, or land.
