ARTICLE III. - WATER USAGE RATE

Sec. 42-40. - Findings.
(a)
The board of commissioners of the county has found that its citizens are desirous of the board furnishing clean drinking water, and that its citizens desire a ready supply of water in greater geographic areas than is presently available. Because the board was without sufficient funds to pay for the cost of the improvement of its water system, the board applied for and has been granted a low-interest loan and grant by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
(b)
The USDA has set the minimum rate which the board must establish to fund the repayment of the low-interest loan, to wit: $29.00 for the first 1,000 gallons of water usage and $3.50 for each additional 1,000 gallons of water usage.
(c)
The environmental protection division requires a graduated rate to foster conservation of the supply of water as a condition of new or modified withdrawal permits.
(d)
The board finds that the water usage rate set in this article is the minimum rate necessary to fund the cost of the supply of water.
