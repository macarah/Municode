Editor's note— At the direction of the city, Art. II, §§ 17-26—17-35 have been removed as similar provisions can be found in Appendix A, §§ 180—189. Former Art. II pertained to soil erosion, sedimentation and polution control and derived from Ord. No. 2012-04, adopted June 11, 2012; Ord. No. 1989-11, adopted November 13, 1989 and Ord. No. 2000-15, adopted November 27, 2000.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2010-07, adopted Sept. 27, 2010 stated "An ordinance to adopt by reference the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and the Coastal Stormwater Supplement. Whereas Kingsland has adopted and is enforcing a Public Works Policies and Specification Manual; and whereas this manual was last updated on September 22, 2008; and whereas the Camden County Drainage Study, Engineering Handbook referred to therein in Section IV does not contain the currently recognized Best Management Practices; now therefore be it ordained by the mayor and council of the City of Kingsland that henceforth, the City adopts and will abide by the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual as it currently exists and may be modified and also adopts and will abide by the Coastal Stormwater Supplement — First Edition, April 2009 as it currently exists and may be modified except wherein the standards in the Public Works Policies and Specification Manual set a higher standard."

Sec. 17-56. - Purpose of article.
The purpose of this article is to regulate the development of unimproved land or the alteration of previously improved land as that development or alteration affects the retention
of stormwater or irrigation water on the site. In addition, this section addresses the effects of developments or alterations on soil erosion and water quality.
(Ord. No. 1986-17, § A, 4-14-86)
Sec. 17-57. - Control of runoff required; information to be included on site plan.
(a)
All land filling and regrading projects must not alter existing drainage flows to a point that would create an adverse effect on abutting properties. All new land development must include a design for swales for adequate control of stormwater. Land filling and grading projects may be allowed as subsidiary developments. Such projects may also be considered along with site plan review procedures. An applicant shall provide topographic information concerning the site of a proposed development indicating the existing direction of storm runoff and the existence of any ditches, canals, streams or storm sewers within or directly adjacent to the land to be developed.
(b)
Any development or redevelopment of land shall not result in shedding more stormwater into adjacent rights-of-way or property than was discharged by the site in its natural unimproved or existing state. The development shall not allow erosion to effect any damage to adjacent areas.
(Ord. No. 1986-17, § B(1), (2), 4-14-86)
Sec. 17-58. - Authority to require additional information.
Additional substantiating information, including but not limited to an inflow-outflow hydrograph, may be required at the discretion of the city engineer in order to verify the adequacy of retention design under this article.
(Ord. No. 1986-17, § B(8), 4-14-86)
Sec. 17-59. - Additional reviews and permits.
Additional reviews and permits for proposed drainage improvements may be required of other agencies as directed by the engineering department.
(Ord. No. 1986-17, § B(7), 4-14-86)
Sec. 17-60. - Approved methods of water retention.
Approved methods of water retention are as follows:
(1)
Retention pond. The surface area, depth, bank slopes (minimum 4:1) and outfall shall be designed according to site requirements and existing engineering department standards. Ponds with standing water shall have a static water depth of six feet. Where a sidewalk or public right-of-way is immediately adjacent to a retention pond, a guardrail or other protective device shall be installed along the sidewalk or right-of-way. Such device shall be required only where the retention pond and sidewalk or right-of-way are abutting.
(2)
Grass, loose rock, turf block paving or landscaped absorption areas. Surface area, configuration and type shall be designed according to site requirements and shall be subject to engineering department review and approval. A percolation test furnished by a testing laboratory shall be required to verify ground absorption capabilities.
(3)
Subsurface drain or percolation field with an outfall to a public drainage system. The length, size and depth of drainpipe, size and type of filter material and location of field shall be designed according to site requirements, and shall be subject to engineering department review and approval. A percolation test furnished by a testing laboratory shall be required to verify ground absorption capabilities.
(4)
Parking areas designed with restrictive stormwater inlets or restrictive pipe sizes. Parking areas shall be designed with a sufficient retention area that, when used in conjunction with a restrictive storm sewer system, shall control the rate of water runoff to conform with city requirements.
(5)
Roof retention. In some cases the proposed building design could allow for a certain amount of water retention or storage on the roof area.
(6)
Driveway areas designed with inverted crowns and perimeter swales with an outfall to a public drainage facility.
(7)
Underground vaults with an outfall to a public drainage facility.
(Ord. No. 1986-17, § B(3), 4-14-86)
Sec. 17-61. - Calculation of stormwater runoff.
(a)
The rational method of analysis shall be used in the design of stormwater systems and shall be the basis of determining size of storage areas. The rational formula is:
Q = CIA
In which:
EXPAND
Q = Runoff in cubic feet per second.
I = Intensity of rainfall in inches per hour.
A = Drainage area, expressed in acres.
C = Coefficient of runoff.
  (b)
Minimum rainfall intensity shall use a 25-year storm 60-minute duration. Intensity of rainfall shall not be less than 3.6 inches per hour.
(c)
Values for the coefficient of runoff (C) are as follows:
EXPAND
Land Use Well-Drained
Soil Poorly Drained
Soil
Agricultural 0.25 0.45
Residential rural 0.35 0.50
Residential rural estate 0.35 0.50
Residential single-family 0.50 0.55

Aquatic land 1.00 1.00
Public ownership 0.25 0.45
  (Ord. No. 1986-17, § B(4), 4-14-86)
Sec. 17-62. - Use of stored water for irrigation.
Where a development has drainage lakes or ponds as part of the stormwater retention system, these water areas shall be incorporated in the internal irrigation system, to be drawn on when sufficient stored water is available.
(Ord. No. 1986-17, § B(5), 4-14-86)
Sec. 17-63. - Developments draining into tidal waters.
The retention requirement of this article offers a method of controlling water quality via the removal of harmful sediments and the like. Therefore, those developments draining directly into tidal waters must also comply with the retention requirement.
(Ord. No. 1986-17, § B(6), 4-14-86)
