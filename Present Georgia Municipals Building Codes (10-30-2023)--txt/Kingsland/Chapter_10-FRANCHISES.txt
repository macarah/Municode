(a)
Definitions.
(1)
"Base year" means the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998.
Secs. 10-34—10-50. - Reserved.
(2)
"Base year franchise fee factor" means the total franchise fees paid during the base year divided by the design day capacity as recorded by the company on the last day of the base year.
(3)
"Design day capacity" means the sum of the individual capacity in dekatherms (DT) attributable to all firm customers located within the city limits of the city, as of the last day of the previous fiscal year.
(4)
"Firm customers" means all residential and business customers who purchase gas service that ordinarily is not subject to interruption or curtailment.
(5)
"Fiscal year" means the 12 months ending September 30 of each year.
(6)
"Inflation index" means the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or any successor index, for the period from September 30, 1997, to the beginning of the then current fiscal year. The percentage shall be reduced by any productivity factor adjustment for the same time period determined by the Georgia Public Service Commission for the company.
(b)
Franchise fee. The total dollar amount of franchise fees paid by the company to the city shall be calculated as follows: The current fiscal year total franchise fee shall equal the product of the design day capacity and the current franchise fee factor. The current franchise fee factor shall be equal to the product of the base year franchise fee factor and one plus the inflation index expressed as a decimal to three significant digits. The following formula quantifies this payment:
FFc = FFFby x (1+(CPI-PFA)) x DDCc
Where FFc = total franchise fees due the city for the current fiscal year.
FFFby = the base year franchise fee factor
CPI-PFA = the inflation index based on the cumulative change in the Consumer Price Index less the productivity factor adjustment determined by the Georgia Public Service Commission.
DDCc = the design day capacity as of the last day of the previous fiscal year.
FFFby = FFby/DDCby where
FFby = the total franchise fees paid in the base year
and DDCby = the design day capacity of the base year.

Responsibility for payment of franchise fee. The company as the holder of the franchise privilege hereunder is responsible for the payment of all franchise fees payable hereunder, and shall file such reports and returns as required by the franchise ordinance as modified by this section.

The franchise fee payments required hereunder shall be in lieu of any franchise fee, license fee, occupation tax or other payment for use of the rights-of-way by the company for the provision of gas service, but shall not prohibit imposition of a license fee or an occupation tax on gas marketers.
(d)
Quarterly payments. Effective for the fiscal year 1999 and for each fiscal year thereafter during the term of the franchise ordinance, the company shall remit to the city quarterly franchise fee installments. The installments shall equal one-fourth of the total annual franchise fee calculated in accordance with this section. The quarterly payment is due and payable on or before the 30th day following the last day of each calendar quarter.
(e)
Annual return. The company shall file a return with its first quarterly installment in each fiscal year showing the details of the calculation of the annual franchise fee.
(f)
Delay of inflation adjustment. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, any inflation adjustments shall be made to the franchise fee only when the company changes its rates.

Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between this section and the original franchise dated December 9, 1985, this section shall control. All terms, conditions and stipulations contained in such franchise ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that they do not conflict with this section.

Sec. 10-68. - Landlord and tenant rights.
(a)
Installation to be permitted.
(1)
Findings. Access to local originated programming and other cable and high speed internet services is an important benefit for all residents of the City of Kingsland, and arbitrary denial of access to tenants by a landlord is contrary to the public interest.
(2)
Landlord to permit installation. A landlord may not prohibit or otherwise prevent a cable TV franchisee from entering a multiple-dwelling unit for the purpose of constructing, installing, or servicing cable system equipment if a tenant or occupant of the unit has requested cable service. A franchisee may not make an installation in an individual dwelling unit unless permission has been given by the tenant occupying the unit.
(3)
Nondiscrimination in rent. A landlord may not discriminate in rental or other charges based on cable TV service subscription. The owner of the real property may require compensation in exchange for permitting the installation of cable system equipment within and on the real property only in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b).
(4)
Franchisee obligations to landlord. A landlord may require a franchisee to install cable system equipment in the multiple-dwelling unit at no cost to the landlord and indemnify the landlord for any damage that results from the installation or removal of cable system equipment.
(5)
Sanctions for violation. A landlord's violation of this section constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of an owner's multiple-dwelling operating license.
(b)
Compensation.
(1)
Compensation in excess of $1.00. If a landlord intends to require the payment of more than $1.00 per individual dwelling unit to allow the installation of cable system facilities or equipment, the landlord shall serve written notice on the franchisee within 20 days of the date the landlord is notified that a franchisee intends to construct or install facilities or equipment in the landlord's multiple dwelling. Unless timely notice is given by the landlord to the franchisee, it is conclusively presumed that the landlord does not claim or intend to require the payment of a sum in excess of a one-time payment of $1.00 in exchange and as compensation for permitting the installation of cable system facilities or equipment.
(2)
Reasonable compensation. A landlord who has given timely notice to a franchisee may assert a claim for reasonable compensation in excess of $1.00 for permitting the installation of cable system facilities or equipment. Within 30 days after the landlord gives notice of intent to demand additional compensation, the landlord shall advise the franchisee in writing of the amount claimed as reasonable compensation. A landlord cannot assert a claim for compensation if the cable system cables, electronics, or equipment was installed at the multiple dwelling unit as of the enactment date of this section.
(3)
Action to enforce claim of compensation. If within 60 days after the receipt of the landlord's claim a franchisee has not agreed to pay the amount claimed or some other amount acceptable to the landlord, the landlord may file an action in court to enforce the claim for compensation. In any such action, it shall be presumed that reasonable compensation is $1.00, but the presumption may be rebutted and overcome by evidence that:
a.
The landlord has a specific alternative use for the space occupied by the cable system facilities or equipment, the loss of which results in a monetary loss to the landlord; or
b.
Installation of cable system facilities or equipment in the multiple-dwelling unit will otherwise substantially interfere with the use and occupancy of the unit to an extent that causes a decrease in the resale or rental value of the real property.
(4)
Determination of damages. In determining damages when no part of the real property is being taken, consideration shall be given only to an injury that is special and peculiar to the real property. The amount of any benefit to the real property by reason of the installation of cable system facilities or equipment shall be deducted from the damages awarded.
(5)
Limitations on compensation. The landlord is not entitled to compensation based on a claim of lost profits or business opportunity from an existing or proposed satellite, microwave, or master antenna television system servicing the multiple-dwelling unit.
(c)

(4)
The work of erecting poles and all other work upon the streets and public places of the city shall be done under the supervision of the mayor and council or other legally constituted governing body of the city, and all sidewalks or street pavements or street surfaces which may be displaced by reason of such work shall be properly replaced and relaid by the Georgia Power Company, or its successors, lessees and assigns, to the satisfaction of the mayor and council or other legally constituted governing body of the city.

In addition to the terms and conditions set forth in the 1965 Ordinance, the company's occupancy and use of the streets, alleys, and public places of the city as authorized in the 1965 Ordinance are subject to the following terms and conditions:
(1)
For purposes of paragraph (2) of this section 1, the term "distribution facilities" means poles, lines, wires, cables, conductors, insulators, transformers, appliances, equipment, connections, and other apparatus installed by or on behalf of the company (whether before or after the adoption of this ordinance amending franchise) in the streets, alleys, or public places of the city for the purpose of distributing electricity within the present and future limits of the city. Distribution facilities do not include any of the following:

Transmission lines and related wires, cables, conductors, insulators, or other apparatus attached to transmission structures;
(iv)

(v)
Network underground facilities.
(2)
In the event that the city or any other entity acting on behalf of the city requests or demands that the company relocate any distribution facilities from their then-current locations within the streets, alleys, and public places of the city in connection with a public project or improvement, then the company shall relocate, at its expense, the distribution facilities affected by such project or improvement. The company's obligation under this paragraph (2) shall apply without regard to whether the company has acquired, or claims to have acquired, an easement or other property right with respect to such distribution facilities and shall not affect the amounts paid or to be paid to the city under the provisions of the 1965 Ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (2), the company shall not be obligated to relocate, at its expense, any of the following:
(i)
Distribution facilities that are located on private property at the time relocation is requested or demanded;
(ii)
Distribution facilities that are relocated in connection with sidewalk improvements (unless such sidewalk improvements are related to or associated with road widening, the creation of new turn lanes, or the addition of acceleration/deceleration lanes);
(iii)
Streetscape projects or other projects undertaken primarily for aesthetic purposes; or
(iv)
Distribution facilities that are converted from an overhead configuration or installation to an underground configuration or installation.
(3)
The city and the company recognize that both parties benefit from economic development within the city. Accordingly, when it is necessary to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution facilities, transmission lines, transmission structures, or other facilities) within the city, the city and the company shall work cooperatively to minimize costs, delays, and inconvenience to both parties while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the city and the company shall communicate in a timely fashion to coordinate projects included in the city's five-year capital improvement plan, the city's short-term work program, or the city's annual budget in an effort to minimize relocation of the company's facilities. Such communication may include, but is not limited to,
(i)
Both parties' participation in the Georgia Utilities Coordinating Council, Inc. (or any successor organization) or a local utilities coordinating council (or any successor organization) and
(ii)
Both parties' use of the national joint utility notification system (or any successor to such system mutually acceptable to both parties).
(4)
With regard to each streetscape project undertaken by or on behalf of the city, the city shall pay the company in advance for the company's estimated cost to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution facilities, transmission lines, transmission structures, or other facilities) in connection with such project. For each streetscape project, the company shall estimate in good faith the amount of incremental base revenue, if any, that the company will realize as a result of new customer load or expansion of existing customer load attributable to such project; and such estimate shall be based on tariffs in effect at the time that construction of such project begins and shall not include fuel recovery charges, nonelectric service billings, or taxes. If such estimate indicates that the company will realize incremental base revenue, the company shall do one of the following, whichever results in greater cost savings to the city:
(i)
Reduce the city's advance payment to the company for relocation costs by ten percent; or
(ii)
Where the city has developed a bona fide marketing plan within twelve months after construction of such project begins, either refund the amount of the company's incremental base revenue during such 12-month period to the city or credit such amount against any future payment due from the city to the company. The city and the company acknowledge and agree that the amount of any refund or credit calculated pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence of this paragraph (4) shall not exceed the amount of the city's advance payment to the company for relocation costs associated with such project.
