Chapter 2.36 - ETHICS CODE
Sections:

2.36.010 - Declaration of policy.
It is essential to the proper government and administration of the city that its mayor and council and the city-appointed officials covered by this chapter be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial, that public service not be used for private gain, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the city government. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibility of city officials, the public interest requires that the city protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the officials covered by this chapter in situations where a conflict may exist. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards hereinafter set forth must be so interpreted and understood as to not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those best qualified to seek and serve in public office. To that end, the officials herein noted should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest appears. The policy and purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall apply to the officials herein noted in the discharge of their official duties, to conform with the objective of protecting the integrity of city government, and to prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service.
