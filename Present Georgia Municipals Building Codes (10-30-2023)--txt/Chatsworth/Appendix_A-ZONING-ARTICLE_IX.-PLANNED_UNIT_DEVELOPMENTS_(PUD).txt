ARTICLE IX. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUD)

Section A. - Intent.
It is the intent of this provision to encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under conventional lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities, and flexibility in design. The community benefits from efficient use of land, preservation of natural amenities and environmentally sensitive areas, and lower development and housing costs. Review and approval of the development plan provides the opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located.
( Ord. of 10-09 )
Section B. - Guidelines for Review of Planned Unit Developments.
The review shall consider the following general objectives and purposes to result in approval or denial of a proposed Planned Unit Development:
1.
Whether the development will be compatible with the topography, hydrology, and other natural features of land; and whether any unusual topographic or other natural features will be disturbed.
2.
Whether the character, design, and layout of proposed land uses are adequate and appropriate to encourage desirable living conditions, and to provide for separation and screening between dissimilar uses within and adjacent to the PUD.
3.
Whether the development will be able to preserve and protect the natural amenities including watersheds, wetlands, groundwater recharge areas, floodplains, steep slopes and wooded areas.
4.
Whether the development will adversely affect developed or undeveloped neighboring properties.
5.
Whether the existing and/or proposed streets, utilities, and other public services are adequate to serve the development, including perpetual maintenance and adequate security.
