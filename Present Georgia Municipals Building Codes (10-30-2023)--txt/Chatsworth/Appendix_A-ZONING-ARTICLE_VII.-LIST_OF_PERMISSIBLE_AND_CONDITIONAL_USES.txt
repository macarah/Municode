ARTICLE VII. - LIST OF PERMISSIBLE AND CONDITIONAL USES
List of Permissible and Conditional Uses. No principal building, structure, or land use shall be permitted except in the zone districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in the following table. Each use is mutually exclusive and does not encompass other uses listed in the table. A principal use denoted by the Letter "X" is allowed in that zone district by right, subject to any special requirement that may be applicable to that use. A principal use denoted by the letter "C" is permitted only if a conditional use permit is granted by the Mayor and Council after review under the Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance, City of Chatsworth, Georgia. For uses not listed in the following table, the Zoning Administrator can determine that said use is similar in impact and intensity to another use that is currently allowed in a zone district and shall rule that the said use is therefore allowed. In the event, that no similarity exists then the proposed use is not allowed or if the interpretation of the Zoning Administrator is questioned, then the Board of Zoning Appeals, properly convened, can make a judgment as to whether said use is allowed in Chatsworth and such ruling shall be final regarding that interpretation. In the event that the Board of Zoning Appeals cannot rule about a specific use then amendment of the Zoning Ordinance shall be required to determine where such use is properly allowed.
