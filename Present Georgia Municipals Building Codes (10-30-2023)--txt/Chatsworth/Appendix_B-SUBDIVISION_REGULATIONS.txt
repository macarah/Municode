Subdivision. The division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, for sale, legacy, or building development, and includes re-subdivision and leaseholds of property, but not buildings and, when appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided. With the exception of conservation design subdivisions as addressed in article 6 of this ordinance, the resulting lot dimensions must conform to the minimum lot dimensions specified in the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance and/or the regulations of the Murray County Board of Health for Individual On-Site Sewage Management Systems, if applicable. For the purpose of this ordinance the definition of a subdivision is broken down into three subcategories as follows:
1.
Exempt subdivisions of land. Divisions of land that have the following characteristics are exempt from review and action by the planning commission or the building inspector under the subdivision regulations as set forth in this ordinance. Such exemption shall not require the city to issue permits for construction if the resulting lots or parcels fail to meet any applicable regulations of the city concerning lot size, lot width, access, and other dimensional requirements. (Note: If the subject lot is within 200 feet of public sewer, then the connection to public sewer is mandatory. If the subject subdivision is within 500 feet of public sewer, then the connection to public sewer is mandatory.)
a.
The sale of entire lots consistent with a previously approved and recorded plat or deeds;
b.
The sale of the total area of an existing lot(s) or parcel(s) or a portion(s) of any lots to one or more adjoining landowners(s) for recombination into one or more adjacent lots or parcel so that the total number of lots is not increased and all resulting lots meet or exceed the requirements of this ordinance;
c.
The acquisition of right-of-way by any county, city, governmental unit, or the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT).
2.
Minor subdivisions of land. All subdivisions of land, which front on an existing public or private street, as defined by this ordinance (see definition for "street" in this article above); do not require any new or improved street; do not require a request for variance from any of the provisions of this ordinance; do not require the extension of public utilities on public rights-of-way [does not mean individual stub-outs]; and, are not in conflict with any of the provisions of this ordinance.
Lots, eligible for approval as a minor subdivision, are often created from larger tracts of land. In such cases, a deed description or the use of break lines (not to scale) to show the relationship of the larger tract to the smaller lots is acceptable. In such cases, the smaller lots must still meet the submittal requirements for a minor subdivision in section 4.5. The following specific examples are included as minor subdivisions:
a.
The division of land between or among heirs or beneficiaries in accordance with the Georgia Probate Code and approved by the Murray County Probate Judge. (Divisions by probate processes are encouraged to comply with prevailing subdivision regulations because in the future such lots may not be owned or occupied by heirs.);
b.
The division of a portion of a lot or parcel by the owner thereof solely for the purpose of placing said divided portion as collateral for a security instrument.
c.
The division of land between immediate family members provided that such divisions meet all requirements of this ordinance in the creation of lots or building sites as outlined in section 4-5.
3.
Major subdivisions of land. All subdivisions not classified as exempt or minor subdivisions. (Note: New street construction or extensions of public water, sewer service, or other utility service are required in a major subdivision.)
Townhouse. One single-family dwelling unit connected in a row of at least two such units in which each unit has its own lot with a front and rear yard, and no unit is located over another unit, and each unit is separated from any other unit by one or more common fire resistant walls.
Variance. A minimal relaxation or modification of the strict terms of this ordinance granted by the planning commission where such modification will not be contrary to the public interest, and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property such as irregular lot size, topography, or other characteristics of the land, and not as the result of any action on the part of the property owner, a literal enforcement of this ordinance would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. Such modification may not authorize, however, the creation of a lot(s) that contain less square footage than the minimum standard established by this ordinance or the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance.
Water course. Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater.
Water system.
1.
Public water system. A system for the provision to the public of piped water for human consumption, if such system has at least fifteen service connections, or regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily, at least 60 days out of the year in accordance with the Rules of Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, Chapter 391-3-5, "Rules for Safe Drinking Water" as amended.
a.
Governmental public water system. A public water system, which is owned and operated by a governmental entity, or a legislatively-created authority. Such connections must also be consistent with the terms of the local service delivery agreement, as amended.
b.
Non-governmental public water system. A public water system, which is owned and operated by any non-governmental entity.
2.
Community water system. A system serving more than one single-family dwelling but fewer than the required connections and/or persons to be considered a public water system.
3.
Individual water supply system. A system of piping, pumps, tanks, or other facilities, which utilities groundwater to supply a single-family dwelling.

(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 4.3. - Pre-submittal conference.
The pre-submittal conference will serve as an informal plan review involving the developer and building inspector. The building inspector and his designees, hereinafter referred to as "staff", at that time shall determine if the submittal constitutes either an exempt, major, or minor subdivision. The purpose is to permit the subdivider to discuss his concept and proposed design. Further, staff can point out any factors that may have an impact on the proposed development and advise the subdivider of various possibilities before substantial amounts of time and money have been invested in a very detailed proposal that may contain elements contrary to this ordinance. During the pre-submittal conference regulations may be distributed, the schedule of planning commission meetings noted, and department approvals and agency contacts identified. The pre-submittal conference is highly recommended for new developers. While such conference is optional, those developers that are familiar with the process of plat approval in Chatsworth are still encouraged to participate.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 4.4. - Determination of subdivision type.
Upon receipt of any subdivision plats, planning staff shall determine whether the proposed subdivision is an exempt, minor, or major subdivision of land as the term "subdivision" is defined in article 2. No subdivision shall be considered exempt, unless so designated by the city, through the building inspector, the planning commission, or other proper agent of the city.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 4.5. - Submittal, review, and approval procedure for a minor subdivision.
Subdividers requesting review and action on a minor subdivision plat shall follow the procedure described below.
1.
Submittal requirements.
a.
A final plat that has been prepared in accordance with subsection 4.6.2(d) shall be submitted to the building inspector for action, together with the prescribed fee and evidence that no taxes or assessments are outstanding against the property.
b.
Where the subdivision involves a townhouse development, a plat including additional site plan specifications shall be required [subsection 4.6.2(e)]. A plat including these additional specifications may be presented in addition to or in lieu of a plat not containing these additional features.
2.
Review procedures.
a.
The building inspector will review the plat for compliance with minimum plat specifications [subsection 4.6.2(d)], design standards (article 5) and conformance with all other applicable rules and regulations (section 4.2).
3.
Approval procedures.
a.
Upon presenting the proposed final plat and site plan, if applicable, to the building inspector, all applicable "certificates of approval" shall already be endorsed except for the "certificate for approval of recording."
The building inspector shall approve or deny the final plat and/or site plan within 15 working days of its submittal. However, the developer may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of this period.
b.
Where a minor subdivision proposes access to a state highway, the Georgia Department of Transportation shall determine the feasibility of such access (Georgia Code of Public Transportation, Section 32-6-151). The building inspector shall include the requirements of the department of transportation in any action taken upon a proposed minor plat.
c.
If plat and/or site plan approval is denied by building inspector, the subdivider may request that the planning commission review the plat and/or site plan, pursuant to the submittal and approval procedure contained in subsection 4.6.2, in which case the action of the planning commission shall be final.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 4.6. - Submittal, review and approval procedure for a major subdivision.
Any applicant requesting approval of a proposed major subdivision shall follow the procedure described below in order to secure approval. Subdividers wishing review and action on a major subdivision shall follow the procedure described below.
1.
Preliminary plat. Subsequent to an optional pre-submittal conference with the building inspector and before any grading, site development, or construction begins, the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat pursuant to the following sequence of submittal, review and approval procedures.
a.
Submittal requirements. The subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat that has been prepared in accordance with subsection 4.6.1(d), together with prescribed fee, to the building inspector, who will coordinate with the planning commission and other interested parties the activities of the review and approval process.
When the subdivision involves a townhouse development or is considered a conservation design subdivision, a plat, including additional site plan specifications, shall be required [subsection 4.6.2(e)]. Preliminary plats including all site plan specifications may be presented, or the plats and site plans may be submitted separately.
A minimum of five copies of the preliminary plat (seven copies where subdivision proposes access to a state highway) and supporting documentation shall be submitted to the building inspector. The submission shall occur a minimum of 15 working days prior to the meeting date of the planning commission at which the subdivider desires the planning commission to take official action. At the discretion of the building inspector, this time limit may be waived.
If a subdivision proposes access to a state highway, then the department of transportation shall receive two copies of the proposed plat to determine the feasibility of such access (Georgia Code of Public Transportation, Section 32-6-151). The planning commission shall include the requirements of the department of transportation in any action taken upon a proposed plat.
In the event that the subdivider plans to secure approval of his subdivision layout by the federal housing administration or other federal or state agency, it is suggested that such approval be secured prior to the submission of a preliminary plat to the planning commission.
b.
Review procedures. Review of the preliminary plat is the most important step in any development review in order to identify problems or obstacles that will inhibit the proposed development. The building inspector will review the plat for compliance with minimum plat specifications [subsection 4.6.1(d)], design standards (article 5) and conformance with all other applicable rules and regulations (section 4.2). The building inspector will coordinate and forward copies of the plat such that all affected parties, including but not limited to those responsible for streets, drainage, provisions for fire, water, sewer, and other infrastructure may conduct individual reviews of the plat.
c.
Approval procedures. The building inspector will direct the preliminary plat to the planning commission for review and action. Within 90 days after the date of review by the planning commission, the planning commission shall approve, or approve with condition, or disapprove the preliminary plat.
Failure of the planning commission to act within 90 days shall be deemed approval of the plat and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the applicant for the planning commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of the period. The grounds for disapproval of any plat shall be stated in writing upon the records of the planning commission and a copy of the grounds provided to the subdivider. After official action by the planning commission, a letter to the subdivider shall be issued by the building inspector notifying the subdivider of the official action. Any conditions attached to the official action shall be stated and if the preliminary plat is denied the reasons for denial shall also be stated.
Planning commission approval of a preliminary plat shall be considered valid for a period of two years from the date of plat approval.
d.
Preliminary plat specifications. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a Georgia Registered Land Surveyor; if a landscape architect or civil engineer contributed to the plat, then so indicate. The plat shall be drawn at a scale no smaller than 100 feet to an inch. The plat shall be drawn in permanent ink on reproducible material not exceeding 20 by 24 inches and shall include:

Also, compliance with National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements administered by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division shall apply.]
2.
Final plat. Subsequent to approval of the preliminary plat, the developer shall submit a final plat pursuant to the following sequence of submittal, review, and approval procedures.
a.
Submitted requirements. Before a final plat is submitted to the building inspector for review and action, one of three criteria must have been met. These criteria are: (1) No public utilities extensions or public or private streets are necessary on the part of the developer; (2) The proposed public improvements which were approved in the preliminary plat have been completed in accordance with approved standards, and certificates of satisfactory completion have been obtained from the appropriate authority(ies); or (3) the developer/subdivider may submit an appropriate bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or funds in escrow in an amount not less than 110 percent of the estimated expenses of construction to proper standards and shall complete construction within one year of the issuance of the first building permit for a lot along such road. Under such circumstances the security shall be posted with the applicable department or agency that will bear the responsibility of completing the public improvement(s) should the developer default.
Further, the developer/subdivider shall indemnify the city, including, but not limited to all elected officials, employees, agents, attorneys, and anyone acting on behalf of the city from any and all liability associated with any failure of the developer/subdivider in connection with his/her status as a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit holder, or any failure of the developer/subdivider to construct any public improvements to the standards required by the city.
The developer shall submit the final plat to the building inspector, prepared in accordance with subsection 4.6.2(d). When the subdivision involves a townhouse development or is considered a conservation design subdivision, a plat, including additional site plan specifications, shall be required [See subsection 4.6.2(e)].
A minimum of five copies of the final plat and site plan, if applicable, and all supporting documentation shall be submitted to the building inspector within two years from the date the preliminary plat was approved; if not, such preliminary plat approval shall lapse.
If the developer places restrictions on any of the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by this ordinance, such restrictions or reference thereto shall be identified on the plat by the following statement: Restrictive covenants apply to the subdivision of lots shown hereon. Also, both the plat and covenants shall be recorded referencing each other. Conservation design subdivisions (article 6, subsections 6.4.5 through 6.4.7) specifically require mechanisms for securing the ownership, maintenance, and perpetuity of open space established through the subdivision review process.
b.
Review procedures. The building inspector will review the plat for compliance with minimum plat specifications (subsection 4.6.2(d)), design standards (article 5) and conformance with all other applicable rules and regulations (section 4.2).
c.
Approval procedures. From the date of plat submission, including all required supporting data and certifications, the building inspector shall approve or disapprove the final plat and/or site plan within 30 days.
Failure of the building inspector to act within 30 days after the date of submission shall be deemed approval of the plat and/or site plan and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the building inspector on demand; provided, however, that the applicant for the building inspector's approval may waive this requirement and consent to the extension of the period. The grounds for disapproval of any plat and/or site plan shall be stated in writing and a copy of the grounds provided to the subdivider.
Approval of the final plat and/or site plan, if applicable, by the building inspector shall not be deemed an acceptance by the city or the public of any street or other ground shown upon the plat or site plan. The subdivider must prepare deeds of conveyance for each right-of-way or other public space and separate action is required before the governing authority.
d.
Final plat specifications. The final plat shall be prepared by Georgia Registered Land Surveyor. If a landscape architect or civil engineer, licensed to practice in Georgia, contributes to the plat then appropriate seals, preferably at 100 feet to an inch, but in no case smaller than 200 feet to an inch shall be shown.

ARTICLE 5. - DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 5.1. - Purpose.
The purpose of good subdivision and site design is to create a functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure that projects will be designed to result in a well-planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 5.2. - General principles of design.
1.
Site analysis. An analysis shall be made of characteristics of the development site, such as site context, geology and soil, topography, climate, ecology, existing vegetation, structures, and road networks, visual features, and past and present use of the site. Development of the site shall be based on the site analysis. To the maximum extent practicable, development shall be located to preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features.
2.
Suitability of the land. Land which the planning commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements or other features which would be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of inhabitants of the land and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the planning commission to solve the problems created by the unstable land conditions.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 5.3. - General subdivision design standards.
1.
Monuments. The subdivider shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision as required herein and as approved by a registered surveyor. Monuments shall be located and set as follows:
a.
Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at street intersections and at the beginning and ending points of curves.
b.
All lot corners shall be marked by iron rods, pipe, or pins at least 18 inches long and five-eighths inch in diameter.
c.
The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall be monumented in the field by iron pins at least 18 inches long and five-eighths inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least 18 inches long. Such pins shall be placed at the point of intersection of the river or stream and lot line, with a meander line established not less than 20 feet back from the bank of the river or stream.
d.
All monuments and pins shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a registered surveyor prior to the time the building inspector recommends approval of the final plat or release of the bond where bond is made in lieu of improvements.
2.
Name of subdivision. The name of the subdivision must have approval of the planning commission or building inspector. The name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision within the city or in any other Murray County jurisdiction.
3.
Residential development design.
a.
The planning commission or building inspector may require alternative lot area and dimensions provided that lots conform to the minimum requirements of the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance and provided that such standards shall be appropriate to the type of development permitted. The planning commission may also review and approve alternative lot area, frontage, setbacks, and/or heights as allowed by article 6 conservation design subdivisions, provided that such standards shall be appropriate to the type of development permitted and is used to protect natural resources. Deviation from the typical lot-by-lot requirements of the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance is applicable only to conservation design subdivisions and the approval of the required subdivision plats and site plans.
b.
Every lot shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles as well as for those needing access to the property for its intended use.
c.
The placement of lots in residential developments shall take into consideration topography, privacy, orientation, drainage, and aesthetics to enhance the benefit and enjoyment of residential occupancy into the future.
4.
Industrial and commercial development design. Commercial and industrial development shall be designed according to the same principles governing the design of residential developments; namely, buildings shall be located according to topography with environmentally sensitive areas avoided to the maximum extent practicable. Factors such as drainage, noise, odor, surrounding land uses and sufficient access shall be considered.
5.
Circulation system design. The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed the needs of the present and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to present an attractive streetscape.
6.
Access by private streets. Private streets may be permitted by the planning commission in subdivision developments where controlled access or privacy is desired by the developer provided such streets meet the following conditions. All private streets shall be constructed to the specifications of the city, however, private streets within Conservation Design Subdivisions are provided additional flexibility as addressed in article 6 and in appendix B-B-II. The developer or developer's successor must provide access for emergency vehicles of the city or any other governmental entity. [Note: These rules do not advocate or allow a subdivision where the lots created therein have principal frontage upon an access easement.]
a.
The preliminary and final plats of a development proposing private streets shall show a statement indicating: The street system is private and will not be maintained or improved by the city.
b.
The plat review before the planning commission shall also include evidence of the legal formation of a property owners association to be charged with the minimum responsibility for maintenance of the private street. Such legal documentation shall be recorded and referenced as an attachment to the final plat.
c.
The deed for each lot or parcel sold from the plat shall also contain the statement: The maintenance and improvement of the private street providing access to the described lot is the responsibility of the property owner(s) association and not the city.
d.
Waiver of liability: Land developments, like condominiums, that are accessed by private internal streets or sharing commonly-owned parking areas may receive some city services, like solid waste service, only after the authorized officer(s) of the valid and functional homeowner's association executes a waiver of liability form that is available in the Office of the city clerk. The completed form shall acknowledge that the city is held harmless for damages to paved surfaces or landscaping while providing requested services to the private property.
7.
Access by easements. All lots created in the city shall front upon a public or private street, meeting specific design standards. Access by easement [minimum width of 20 feet] shall only be allowed as a secondary residential access or as a complementary cross-access between commercial or industrial lots already having the required minimum frontage on a public or private street.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 5.4. - Special provisions governing unit ownership (townhouse subdivisions).
1.
General provisions. Whenever a developer, the sole owner, or the co-owners of a building or buildings expressly declare through the submission of a master deed, lease, or plat their desire to submit their property to a regime wherein there is established a horizontal property regime, each such townhouse or property regime created for the purpose of sale or transfer of real property is subject to the provisions of these standards.
2.
Submission of plat required. Prior to the sale or transfer of any property incorporated in the property regime, the developer, sole owner, or co-owners of such property shall submit to the planning commission and obtain their approval of the subdivision plat of such property in the manner prescribed in this ordinance.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 5.5. - Lot design standards.
All lots hereafter established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards.
a.
Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines.
b.
Jurisdictional limits and lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by city or county boundary lines.
c.
Lot frontage. Each lot created shall have direct abutting frontage to an approved public or private street. Each lot must front for at least 50 feet upon an approved street. Construction and/or maintenance of driveways connecting to the public street R/W or to the private road shall be the sole responsibility of the lot or parcel owner. Lots, however, within a Conservation Design Subdivision are exempt from such frontage requirements as provided in the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance and article 6 of this ordinance.
d.
Setback lines. Setback lines per lot shall be as required by the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance, however, lots within a conservation design subdivision are exempt from such requirements in lieu of flexibility provided by the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance and article 6 of this ordinance.
e.
Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by this ordinance and any other applicable ordinance.
f.
Panhandle or flag lots. "Panhandle" or "flag" lots are generally to be considered an unacceptable design technique, but may occur after a finding and approval has occurred before the Chatsworth Planning Commission that unique physical or environmental characteristics of a parent tract preclude efficient and logical subdivision in accordance with standard design. The required width and area will be allowed where terrain makes standard design or frontage impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access shall not be less than 50 feet wide and the panhandle access shall not be more than 200 feet long. Not more than two such panhandle access points shall abut each other.
g.
Double or reverse frontage lots. Double and reverse frontage, unless required or approved by the planning commission or building inspector, shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation, and property size. A planted screen reservation of at least five feet, across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic arterials or other disadvantageous use.
h.
Reserved.
i.
Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform to the minimum front building setback requirement on both streets. The remaining lot lines shall meet side building setback requirements. Corner lot lines at road intersections shall have minimum radii of 20 feet.
j.
Lot remnants. Lot remnants shall be prohibited. Such remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unbuildable parcels.
k.
Easements. Easements, with designated widths and purposes shown on the plat, shall be provided in subdivisions for the following purposes:
(i) [2]
Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street rights-of-way, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall not be less than 20 feet in width or in concurrence with the width required by the utility provider. Where possible, such easements shall be centered on rear or side lot lines.
(ii)
Water course and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of said water course and be of sufficient width or construction, or both, as to be adequate for the purpose.
Where appropriate, the utility provider or applicable Department of the city, at their request, shall be provided with the written legal mechanism necessary to document the location, width, and purpose of such perpetual easement.
(iii)
Access easements. Allowed only as described by subsections 5.3.7 and 5.5(h).
l.
Residential lot depth. Residential lot depth shall generally not be more than four times the lot width at the building line.
m.
Commercial and industrial lots. Commercial and industrial subdivisions of land shall also be subject to the approval of the planning commission or building inspector and shall comply with the requirements of the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance.
n.
Minimum lot dimensions and area. Except for lots within a conservation design subdivision (see article 6), the minimum lot area, the minimum lot width at the front building line, and the setback lines shall be as required in the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Easements for electrical utilities may use the easement policy of the service provider.

Sec. 5.6. - Street design standards.
All streets, whether public or private, which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a major subdivision shall comply with any construction specifications of the city.
1.
Access to arterials and collectors. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector route, as defined by this ordinance, the planning commission may require that access to such street be limited by:
a.
The subdivision of lots so as to back on to the arterial or collector street and front on a parallel local street;
b.
A series of cul-de-sac, "U" shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial or collector street; or
c.
A frontage street.
2.
Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such street shall generally not be permitted. However, in extraordinary circumstances the planning commission may allow creation of a reserve strip to enable a more appropriate pattern of lots or streets. Where such is created, the planning commission must agree to any and all future dispositions of same. A notation to this effect shall be entered on the final plat or approved as an auxiliary instrument attached thereto.
3.
Arrangement of continuing and dead-end streets. Where a subdivision will contain temporary or permanent dead-end streets they shall be designed as follows:
a.
Arrangement of continuing streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of major streets between adjacent properties when in the opinion of the planning commission such continuation is necessary for convenient movements of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient provision of utilities, and when such continuation is in accordance with the major street or road plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary cul-de-sac, temporary "T", or "Y"-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets as required in the following turnabout standards, with a notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutting property owners whenever the street is continued.
b.
Dead-end streets. Where a street does not extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the planning commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the planning commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnabout shall be provided at the end of a dead-end street in accordance with the requirements of the city.
4.
Intersections. Intersections of new streets in a subdivision shall comply with the following standards:
a.
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be permitted. The angle of intersection is to be measured at the intersection of the street center lines. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless approved by the planning commission.
b.
Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall coincide, wherever practicable, with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Jogs for opposing streets having centerline offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected streets are separated from each other by an unbroken median at either intersection. Where streets intersect arterial or collector routes, their alignment shall be continuous (no jog). Intersections of arterial or collector streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
c.
Minimum curve radius at the intersection of two local streets shall be 25 feet, and minimum curve radius at an intersection involving a collector street shall be 30 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement.
d.
Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent grade for a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
5.
Additional width on existing streets. In subdivisions that adjoin existing streets, the subdivider shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the minimum street width requirements as follows:
a.
The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the street.
b.
When the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided.
6.
Street names. Streets or roads that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing named streets shall bear that name. The names of new streets and roads shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission/911 director and shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names of streets in the city or in any other Murray County jurisdiction irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, drive, place, lane, or court, etc.
7.
Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways, where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
a.
In residential areas, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normally required depth of the lot may be required adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening; the placement of structures herein is prohibited".
b.
In commercial or industrial areas, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad or limited access highway shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth of commercial or industrial sites.
c.
Streets parallel to a railroad or limited access highway, when intersecting a street that crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practical, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
8.
Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the city shall be constructed at the full expense of the subdivider without reimbursement from the city. The sharing of expenses for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the city, may be fixed by special agreement between the city and the subdivider. The cost shall be pro-rated to the subdivider as to the percentage of his development so served. The engineering design of all bridges shall be reviewed and approved by the city. Any preliminary plat identifying the construction of a bridge must bear the seal of a Georgia Certified Civil Engineer.
9.
Special purpose streets.
a.
Half streets. Half streets are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision.
b.
Split level streets. Streets, which are constructed so as to have two traffic ways, each at a different level within the same right-of-way, shall provide a minimum right-of-way of 25 feet per traffic way and such additional right-of-way as necessary to meet the requirements of subsection 5.6.5 and a minimum paved traffic surface of 15 feet. The slope between the two traffic ways would not be less than two to one.
c.
One-way streets. If permitted by the planning commission, one-way streets shall meet a minimum right-of-way of 25 feet and a pavement width of 15 feet.
c.
Alleys. Alleys or service drives may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial, or industrial developments but shall not be provided in one and two family residential developments unless the alley or services drive is to provide secondary access to a lot (lots) whose natural grade is (are) more than 12 feet above the finished street grade, or unless the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for an alley or service drive; pavement width is 15 feet with or without curbs; right-of-way, 20 feet.

1.
Purpose. In lieu of the completion of the required improvements necessary for final plat approval, the city may accept security in an amount and form satisfactory to him, providing for the actual construction and installation of the improvements. A separate security in an amount and form satisfactory to city will be required for the actual construction and installation of infrastructure improvements that they regulate.
2.
Form of security. The developer shall provide adequate and acceptable security from a bank or other reputable institution, which certifies the following:
a.
That the creditor does guarantee funds in an amount equal to 110 percent of the cost of completing all required improvements, as estimated by the developer and approved by the city as appropriate.
b.
That, in the case of failure on the part of the developer to complete the specified improvements within the required time period, the creditor shall immediately pay to the city, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of credit stated in the applicable letter or up to the principal amount of the bond.
c.
That the security may not be withdrawn, or reduced in amount, until released by the city.
3.
Time limits. Prior to the granting of final plat approval, the developer and the city, shall agree upon a deadline for the completion of all required improvements. Such deadline per phase shall not exceed one year from the date of final approval.
4.
Release of security. When the required improvements have been completed by the developer to the satisfaction of the city as applicable, then each entity shall release the security.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 5.10. - Improvement maintenance security.
1.
Maintenance required. The developer shall be required to maintain all public improvements in a development for a period of one year. The one-year maintenance period shall commence with the date of the city accepting the deed or, if secured by a surety for completion of improvements, as provided for in subsection 5.9.2, then the one-year period shall be measured from the date the security is released.
2.
Maintenance security - form and amount. The developer shall post with the clerk of the city an acceptable form of security payable to the city in an amount equal to ten percent of the total cost of the public improvements. The purpose of the security is to insure faithful maintenance of said installations and improvements by the developer.
3.
Call for security. If, upon being notified by the city of failure of required installations or improvements, the subdivider does not correct the deficiency or commence work within ten days of notice, it shall be deemed to be a failure on the posted security, and the city shall have the right to make the necessary repairs, either by public work or by private contract, and the surety, cash deposit and/or escrow account aforesaid shall be liable for the full amount of the cost of said repairs. The ten percent security does not indemnify the developer from those costs exceeding the ten percent security during the one-year maintenance period.
4.
Release of security. At the end of the one-year period of time, the developer may formally petition the governing authority to release the maintenance security. If the improvements are acceptable to the city, at that time, dedication will be accepted and the maintenance security will be released.

ARTICLE 6. - CONSERVATION DESIGN SUBDIVISIONS

Sec. 6.1. - Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to provide flexibility in ensuring preservation of open space within a master-planned residential development. A conservation subdivision design preserves open space while maintaining the pro-rated density of residential units for the overall site area. Neutral density is achieved by allowing smaller individually-owned residential lots in neighborhoods that are surrounded by aesthetically and ecologically important areas. The goal of the design process is to identify and set aside conservation open space areas prior to the delineation of transportation and residential pod layouts. Open space areas may include wetlands, river buffer zones, woodlands, playing fields, steep slopes, and meadows, depending on the resources of the land.
1.
The intent of the conservation design subdivision regulations is to:
(a)
Preserve significant areas of land for ecological, recreational, and agricultural purposes in perpetuity;
(b)
Encourage more efficient development of land consistent with public health, safety, and general welfare;
(c)
Afford greater flexibility of design and placement of buildings and structures;
(d)
Preserve and protect exceptional terrain, natural beauty, or sites of historic interest from inconsequential placement of homes, roadways, utilities and appurtenances;
(e)
Preserve all the streams and tributaries in the City of Chatsworth as natural resources;
(f)
Minimize flooding, erosion, and water pollution, and protect the quality and quantity of drinking water;
(g)
Preserve wetlands, aquifers, topographical or soil features, wildlife habitat; and other features having conservation values, including views, vistas, and indigenous vegetation and wildlife; and
(h)
Promote a less sprawling form of development.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 6.2. - Procedure.
Conservation design subdivisions are allowed as a permitted right in accordance with the requirements set forth in article 6 of the subdivision regulations of the city. Also, conservation design subdivisions are allowed as an option in all residential zoning districts, except R-3 and O-R, subject to modification of the standing residential zoning requirements of that zone district and the approval of site plans/plats complying with the intent of conservation design subdivisions and the platting requirements.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 6.3. - Housing density determination.
The number of applicable lots or dwelling units created shall be density neutral. Density neutral is defined as maintaining the number of lots or dwelling units so as not to exceed the number that can be created with the conventional minimum area and width as established in the subdivision regulations of the city and the Chatsworth Zoning Ordinance.
1.
Number of lots. The maximum number of lots in the conservation design subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
(a)
Calculation: The maximum number of lots or dwelling units, as applicable, is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size as determined by the minimum lot size allowed in the residential zone district where such subdivision is proposed. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
(1)
Slopes 25 percent or greater with at least 5,000 square feet of contiguous area.
(2)
The 100-year floodplain.
(3)
Bodies of open water with over 5,000 square feet of contiguous area.
(4)
Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
(b)
Yield plan: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of functional lots possible. The plan or plat does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan or plat, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations for streets (ie. grade) and service to lots.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 6.4. - Open space.
1.
Definition. Open space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that is set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument (see subsections 6.4.6 and 6.4.7).
2.
Standards to determine open space.
(a)
The minimum restricted open space shall comprise at least 40 percent of the gross tract area.
(b)
The following are considered primary conservation areas and are required for inclusion within the open space, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this article:
(1)
The 100-year floodplain;
(2)
Riparian zones at least 75 feet wide, along all perennial and intermittent streams;
(3)
Slopes 25 percent or greater with at least 5,000 square feet of contiguous area;
(4)
Wetlands that meet the definition used by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act;
(5)
Populations of endangered or threatened species, or habitat for such species; and
(6)
Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds.
(c)
The following are considered secondary conservation areas and should be included within the open space to the maximum extent feasible:
(1)
Important historic sites;
(2)
Existing healthy, native forests with a contiguous area of at least one acre;
(3)
Individual existing healthy trees greater than eight inches caliper, as measured five feet high from ground level on the bole of the tree (diameter breast high);

(d)
Above-ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface may be included within the protected open space, but cannot be counted towards the 40 percent minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and existing trails may be counted). Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space.
(e)
At least 25 percent of the open space shall consist of land that is suitable for building.
(f)
At least 75 percent of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract. The open space shall adjoin any neighboring areas of open space, other protected areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected open space.
(g)
The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space.
3.

Establishment of a mandatory Home Owners Association (HOA) to own and maintain the land in common for the open space purposes intended according to the following provisions (See suggestions for the HOA in Appendix B-B-I):
(1)
Prior to final plat approval, developers desiring to build a conservation design subdivision will create and submit minimum requirements and structure for the HOA before the first lot is sold;
(2)
The HOA will maintain, pay taxes, and own the open space. [In some communities the local government may agree to maintain the open space; see item (b) below.];
(3)
Membership in the HOA is mandatory for all homeowners, and dues are uniform; and
(4)
The HOA, by law, will stipulate that a third party, such as the local government, may enforce the maintenance of the open space through legally enforceable liens.
(b)
Dedication of legally described and platted "open space" to the city or the Chatsworth/Murray County Recreation Department.
(c)
Dedication of legally described and platted "open space" to a land trust established in compliance with the requirements of Georgia law and shall be for conservation purposes. [In lieu of ownership, a binding conservation easement to the applicable land trust can also be declared across the conservation lands.]
6.
Open space ownership and maintenance. The approval of such subdivision shall require the owner or owners of open space land to execute, acknowledge, and file in the land records of Murray County, including documents and maps which effectively create a conservation easement or other legal conveyance approved by the city or Murray County or their designee. Theses records (see legal considerations in subsection 6.4.7 and suggestions for open space in Appendix B-B-I):
(a)
Will be binding on all future owners of the open space land;
(b)
May be enforced by the adjoining property owners, the City of Chatsworth, Murray County, or a land trust by appropriate court action for equitable relief in the form of an injunction;
(c)
Will assure appropriate maintenance, by the homeowners' association or as otherwise herein provided, of open space land to the satisfaction of the City of Chatsworth;
(d)
Will provide that if maintenance, preservation, and/or use of the open space land no longer complies with the provisions of the easement, the City of Chatsworth may take all necessary action to effect compliance and assess the costs against the owners in default; and
(e)
Will provide that such easement may not be modified, altered, or amended.
7.
Legal instrument for permanent protection.
(a)
The open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one of the following:
(1)
A permanent conservation easement in favor of either:
(i)
A land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit organization with legal authority to accept such easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions; or
(ii)
A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this ordinance.
(2)
If the entity accepting the easement is not the city, then a third right of enforcement favoring the city shall be included in the easement.
(3)
A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity.
(4)
An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by the city.
(b)
The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions and permitted uses contained in subsections 6.4.3 and 6.4.4, as well as any further restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space.
8.
Septic systems, wells, and stormwater management systems. Easements will allow designated open space to be used for community sewer system drip lines or wells, and storm water management structures designed to promote on-site infiltration and/or treatment of runoff.
9.
Significant structures. Structures of historic, architectural, or cultural significance existing prior to development of the subdivision may be retained within the open space.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 6.5. - Road specifications.
Design standards for road construction in a conservation design subdivision shall be generally consistent with those set forth in the Chatsworth Infrastructure Specifications, however, the flexible standards list in Appendix B-B-11 shall also be available as options if the street system is to remain private. (Even as private streets, the requirements for street base and all storm water drainage mechanisms shall comply with the requirements of Chatsworth, and public safety and emergency access issues remain valid.)
Private streets, constructed using the flexible standards addressed in Appendix B-B-II, are not eligible for future dedication to the city unless such roads are improved to comply with all specifications of the city.
1.
Road locations.
(a)
Roads should be located in a way that minimizes adverse impacts to primary and secondary conservation areas.
(b)
To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over 15 percent shall be strongly discouraged.
(c)
Permanent turnarounds employing a "T," "Y," or half-circle designs are available alternatives if deemed necessary to minimize effects on terrain.
(d)
Alleys, otherwise available only as a secondary access to one or two-family residential developments [subsection 5.6.9(d)], are available for primary access in a conservation design subdivision due to terrain or overall design considerations.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
Sec. 6.6. - Locations of building sites.
As long as the number of buildings meet the density neutral criterion set in section 6.3 it is intended that developers are given flexibility on building locations based on environmental factors and the types of developments the market will bear.
1.
Building location considerations. The Chatsworth Planning Commission shall evaluate the appropriateness of proposed building locations on conceptual preliminary site plans and plats to determine whether the proposed locations satisfy considerations listed in Appendix B-B-III.
2.
Generally, a minimum distance of 100 feet shall separate building sites from primary conservation areas.
3.
Building sites can be located within 50 feet of secondary conversation areas in order to take advantage of views without negatively impacting primary conservation areas.
4.
Building "footprint" locations may not be changed more than 50 feet from preliminary plat to final plat without the approval of the Chatsworth Planning Officer.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
APPENDIX B-A. - FEE SCHEDULE
Major Subdivision (includes preliminary and final plat) .....$100 + $2.00 per lot

(Note: the above fees include the amount necessary to record the plat in the Office of the Superior Court Clerk of Murray County.)
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
APPENDIX B-B-I. - HOME OWNERS ASSOCIATION
Suggestions for the home owners association (HOA):
At least one member of the HOA should receive training in wildlife habitat conservation, enhancement, and maintenance.
Each homeowner should be given site-specific information about indigenous habitat and diversity of species.
• The HOA should develop a long-term conservation plan for maintenance of common areas. This plan should include examples of environmentally friendly landscaping techniques for homeowners.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
APPENDIX B-B-II. - OPEN SPACE AND STREETS
Suggestions for open space:
A minimum of ten percent should be used for active recreation, such as playing fields or community buildings/amenity centers (swim/tennis). [Note: the community buildings/amenity centers require planned open space to equal 50 percent or more of the gross tract area.]
Open space in one development should be linked to open space in adjoining developments to create the largest, continuous area of open space possible.
Suggestions for streets:
• Minimize the number of cul-de-sac streets by providing more than one entrance to the development and interconnect streets as much as possible; the importance of environmental areas and the connections between them are important in conservation design subdivisions, and shall be considered in determining whether street interconnections are possible.
• For cul-de-sac streets, minimize the amount of impervious surface by limiting the internal turning radius to 20 feet and the width of the paved lane to 16 feet. Use grass and vegetation for the inner circle of turnarounds, rather than paving the entire area. In the neighborhood Bylaws, declare the HOA responsible for the maintenance of the grassy area.
Vegetated swales are encouraged in a conservation subdivision plan as an alternative to curb and gutter. Omit curbs wherever possible. This allows runoff from roofs and pavements to pass immediately through grass swales or infiltration basins. Use plant material that will absorb rainwater and act as a natural filter for oil and pollution.
Use permeable pavement for street surfaces, driveways, sidewalks, and pedestrian and bike paths, except where steep slopes, swelling soils, and other site-specific constraints make it unfeasible. Examples of permeable pavement used in neighborhood developments include permeable crushed stone aggregate, open-celled pavers, porous asphalt, and porous concrete. Wooden decks, paving stones, and wood mulch are recommended for pedestrian areas.
• Provide marked, paved paths for non-vehicular traffic within the development and connecting to neighboring residential and commercial areas.
(Ord. of 3-3-2008)
APPENDIX B-B-III. - EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR BUILDING SITE LOCATIONS
In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be considered by the Chatsworth Planning Commission as indicating design appropriate to the site's natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this ordinance. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas. Accordingly, the Chatsworth Planning Commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan:
1.
Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities).
2.
Preserves and maintain mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended, with two exceptions. The first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands, which raise an equal or greater preservation concern, as described in subsections 5 and 8 below. The second involves predominantly agricultural areas, where remnant trees groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat.
3.
If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a field, as seen from existing public roads. Other considerations include whether the development is visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs and wildflowers (specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow).
4.
Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds.
5.
Designs around existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields or meadows, minimizing impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres), especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines. Also, woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils, with slopes greater than ten percent, should be avoided, where possible. However, woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development. When any woodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal fields, etc.) in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable.
6.
Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from public roadways. (For example, in open agrarian landscapes, a deep "no-build, no-plant" buffer is recommended along the public roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant. In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a deep "no-build, no-cut" buffer should be respected, to preserve existing vegetation.
7.
Avoids sitting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking advantage of lower topographic features.
8.
Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and/or by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Georgia Protected Species Updated List.
9.
Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological or cultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature, including stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar holes, earthworks, burial grounds, etc.
10.
Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with historic buildings, stonewalls, hedgerows, etc.
11.
Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac islands, and both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value. Planted trees along roadways shall be spaced at intervals so that the neighborhood will have a stately and traditional appearance when they grow and mature. Such trees shall generally be located between the sidewalk or footpath and the edge of the street, within a planting strip not less than five feet in width.
12.
Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering convenient access by residents, and adequately screened from nearby house lots.
13.
Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable).
14.
Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous, and whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the Design and Management Handbook for Preservation Areas, produced by the Natural Lands Trust. For example, fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development. To the greatest extent practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels, and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems, as per the policies in the Murray County, Chatsworth, and Eton Joint Comprehensive Plan, 2005-2025, or equivalent.
