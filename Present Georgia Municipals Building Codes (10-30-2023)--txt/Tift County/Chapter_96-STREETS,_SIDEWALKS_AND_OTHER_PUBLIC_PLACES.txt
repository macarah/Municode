Sec. 96-53. - Closing/abandoning standard and factors.
(a)
Standard. In order for a road to be closed, the board of commissioners shall determine that all or part of the road has ceased to be used by public so as to no longer serve any substantial useful purpose, or that the removal of the road from the county road system is otherwise in the best public interest.
A road shall not be closed for the purpose of helping a private landowner. The closing must serve some public purpose such as relieving the public from the charge of maintaining a road or street, the street or road are no longer useful or convenient to the public, etc.
(b)
Considered factors. There are several factors, which may be considered by the board of commissioners in deciding whether or not to close a road or street. These factors as follows:
(1)
Source of title. Does the county own fee simple title to the road/street or merely an easement for use by public for road purposes?
(2)
Present use of road, street or alley. How is the road, street or alley currently being used: (a) general public; (b) limited use by a small group; (c) location of public utilities; or (d) unopened right-of-way.
(3)
Past history. What use has been made of the road/street in the last 20 years?
(4)
Potential need for road in the future. What is the potential for development along the proposed closing/abandoning: (a) to serve future growth area; (b) transportation plan projects future right-of-way needed; and (c) volume to capacity ratio shows need to retain street.
(5)
Cost involved in closing/abandoning or opening road/street. (a) obstructions in or along right-of-way or at ends of road/street; (b) attorneys fees and court costs projected to exceed value of road/street; or (c) other.
(6)
Availability of other means of travel to take place of vehicular traffic using roadway. (a) public transportation; (b) adjoining landowners' assistance; (c) neighborhood; (d) emergency vehicles; (e) garbage pickup; or (f) other.
(7)
Benefit to public in continuing public usage of roadway (a) serves adjoining landowners; (b) serves neighborhood traffic needs; (c) provides access for emergency vehicles; (d) allows garbage pick-up and other services; and (e) other.
(8)
Benefit to public in closing road. (a) eliminates road grading expense; (b) eliminates traffic movement hazards; (c) allows better land use plan for development of adjoining land; and (d) other.
(9)
Adverse impact to public in closing road. (a) prevents landowner(s) from accessing public road; (b) interrupts comprehensive transportation plan project; (c) interrupts neighborhood to neighborhood transportation connection; and (d) other.
Although these factors may be considered, the board of commissioner's ultimate standard for determination is whether the road serves no substantial public purpose and/or whether it is otherwise in the best public interest to close/abandon the road.
(Ord. No. 2012-03, art. III, 10-8-12)
