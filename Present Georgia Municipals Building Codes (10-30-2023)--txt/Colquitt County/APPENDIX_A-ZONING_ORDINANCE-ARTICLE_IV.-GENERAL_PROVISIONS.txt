In addition, the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district shall be screened from such contiguous residentially zoned district by either a building housing a permitted use or else by an ornamental masonry wall or chain link fence five feet in height above grade, between said greenbelt areas and the commercial or industrial use in said C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district. Such greenbelt shall be planted with deciduous trees, evergreens, flowering trees and/or ornamental trees set not closer than six feet to the fence or wall.
The remainder of the landscaped area which is not planted with the aforementioned stock shall be in well-kept lawn. All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance.
All planting plans shall first be submitted to the planning commission/county commission for approval as to suitability of planting materials and arrangement thereof in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.
Where vehicles or open air display generally exceed a five-foot height, said wall or chain link fence shall be increased to a height not exceeding ten feet, providing further that all such walls shall be of uniform height around the premises and the design of such wall is first approved by the planning commission/county commission.
If, in the opinion, of the planning commission/county commission, the greenbelt would serve no good purpose, the commission may waive such requirements, and provide only the wall or fence between the residential and C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district, provided it abuts a nonconforming use in a residential area.
b.
Residential property across alley. Any C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district on which a drive-in business, open air display, commercial parking lot or other open use is conducted shall be separated along its entire length from any adjacent residentially zoned district, located across a public alley of not less than 20 feet wide, by either a building housing permitted use or by an ornamental masonry wall five feet in height above grade located, preferably, on the residential side of said public alley. Greater wall height may be required in accordance with paragraph "a" above.
c.
Waiver of wall or fence requirement. Where required walls or fences are provided on the business side of public alleys, wall or fence requirements may be waived to provide necessary entrance to or exit from required off-street/road parking and loading areas, provided approval is secured from the planning commission and county commission as to suitability of width and location of such openings in said wall or fence.
d.
Setbacks from agricultural zones. The main dwelling must be a minimum of 125 feet from the property line adjacent to property zoned agricultural (AG).
When a non-agricultural use is proposed for property abutting an agricultural (AG) district, or will be located within the required minimum setbacks for this district, the developer or property owner shall be provided with a "notice of agricultural adjacency" at the time an application for building permit or change in zoning classification or use is filed. As a condition of and prior to any administrative action on either the change in zoning classification or use request, or the issuance of any land use, building, or occupancy permit, the applicant shall be required to sign on a waiver on a form prepared by the zoning official(s) which will indicate that the applicant understands that there is an ongoing agricultural land use adjacent to the subject property which could produce odors, noise, dust, and other effects which may not be compatible with the applicant's development. Nevertheless, understanding the effects of agricultural operations and uses on adjacent land, the applicant agrees, by executing the form, to waive any objection to those effects and understands that this change in zoning classification or use and/or permits are issued and processed in reliance on his agreement not to bring any action against adjacent landowners, whose property is agricultural and an agricultural operation, or any local government, asserting that the adjacent agricultural operations or uses of agricultural land constitutes a nuisance; provided that said existing agricultural use is operated in conformance with this ordinance and with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations. Any such notice or acknowledgement provided to or executed by a landowner adjoining an existing agricultural use or within the minimum setbacks for said use shall be a public record.
The agricultural use notice and waiver shall include the following information in substantially the same or similar format and content:
"You are hereby notified that all or part of the property you are proposing to use or build upon is located within the required minimum setback of adjacent agricultural land with one or more existing agricultural operations. You may be subject to inconvenience or discomfort from lawful agricultural operations. Discomfort and inconvenience may include, but not limited to, noise, odors, fumes, dust, smoke, burning, vibrations, insects, rodents, and/or the operation of machinery (including aircraft) during any 24-hour period. One or more inconveniences may occur as a result of agricultural operations that are in compliance with existing laws and regulations and accepted customs and standards. If you live or operate a use near an agricultural area, you should be prepared to accept such inconveniences or discomfort as a normal and necessary aspect of living in an area with a strong rural character and an active agricultural sector. Your signature constitutes an agreement not to bring any action against local landowners whose property is agricultural land or is in agricultural operation, or against local government, asserting that the adjacent agricultural operation or uses of agricultural lands constitutes a nuisance."
