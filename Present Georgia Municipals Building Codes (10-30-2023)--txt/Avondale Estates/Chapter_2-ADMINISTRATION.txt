No. 0203, §§ 5.1—5.10, adopted Oct. 28, 2002. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis of inclusion.

Sec. 2-91. - Preamble.
In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1, any person in government service should:
(1)
Put loyalty to the highest moral principle and to country above loyalty to persons, party or government department.
(2)
Uphold the Constitution, laws and legal regulations of the United States, the State of Georgia and all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.
(3)
Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay and give to the performance of his duties his earnest and best thought.
(4)
Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.
(5)
Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not, and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.
(6)
Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.
(7)
Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties.
(8)
Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.
(9)
Expose corruption wherever discovered.
(10)
Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.
(Ord. No. 0304, § 1, 7-28-03)
Sec. 2-92. - Ethics for government service.
In addition, the board of mayor and commissioners establishes the following "Code of Ethics":
(1)
The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed.
(2)
All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only; and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. Ga. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 2, Paragraph 1.
(3)
The people of this state have the inherent right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security and benefit of the people; and at all times they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it. Ga. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 2, Paragraph 2.
(4)
The people have a right to expect that every public official will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he represents.
(5)
Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly: (a) treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness and equality under the law; and (b) avoid conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest.
(Ord. No. 0304, § 1, 7-28-03)
Sec. 2-93. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office is not used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a Code of Ethics for all city officials is adopted.
(b)
This code has the following purposes: (1) to encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; (2) to establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts and actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city; (3) to require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interests in manners that affect the city; and (4) to serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms.
(c)
The provisions of this article shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports of regulation of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.
(Ord. No. 0304, § 1, 7-28-03)
Sec. 2-94. - Scope of persons covered.
The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all members of the board of mayor and commissioners, planning and zoning board, zoning board of appeals, all advisory commissions and committee members.
(Ord. No. 0304, § 1, 7-28-03)
Sec. 2-95. - Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is intended:
City official or official, unless otherwise expressly defined, means the mayor, members of the commission, municipal court judges (including substitute judges), city manager, assistant city managers, city clerk, deputy city clerks, whether such person is salaried, hired or elected, and all other persons holding positions designated by the City Charter, as it may be amended from time to time.
