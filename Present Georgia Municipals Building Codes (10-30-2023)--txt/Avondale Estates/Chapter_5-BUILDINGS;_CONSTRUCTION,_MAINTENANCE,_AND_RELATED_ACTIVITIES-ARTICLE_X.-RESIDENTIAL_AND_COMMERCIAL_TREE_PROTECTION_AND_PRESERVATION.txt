(Ord. No. 18-05, § 2(Att.), 10-22-2018; Ord. No. O-2022-01, § 6, 1-12-2022)
Sec. 5-404. - Standards of tree preservation and replacement.
(a)
Minimum required canopy coverage. A property where a project is undertaken is required to achieve a minimum of fifty (50) percent coverage of the subject property by healthy, mature trees after construction is complete.
(b)
Measurement of tree canopy. The calculation of percentage of tree canopy coverage is based on the ratio of A/B x 100, where "A" is the area of healthy tree canopy provided by existing and new trees, and "B" is the net site area of the property where a project is undertaken. The term "B", the net site area of the subject property, is the total area of the site, according to the approved building permit plans, after excluding street rights-of-way, areas permanently covered by water, and detention ponds. The calculation of "A" is based on the sum of existing and proposed new trees, using the following methods for measurement:
(1)
Existing trees. The tree canopy of existing trees is measured from a tree survey as provided in section 5-405(c). The existing tree canopy is the amount of ground within the critical root zone (CRZ) of existing healthy trees on a property that is the site of a project. Dead or diseased trees cannot be included in the tree canopy measurement.
(2)
Overlapping trees. If the distance between two (2) trees is less than the sum of the CRZ's of the two (2) trees, then these are overlapping trees. The tree canopy of existing overlapping trees is determined from a drawing showing the outer perimeter of the CRZs of the group of overlapping trees within the subject property. An estimate of the outer perimeter of the CRZ may be made using grid paper or other method acceptable to the city tree official. See example below:
EXAMPLE OF CANOPY CALCULATION FOR 3 OVERLAPPING TREES
(3)
Boundary trees. The portion of the critical root zone of healthy boundary trees that is within the property where a project is undertaken is included in the measurement of tree canopy on the subject property.
(4)
Public trees. The portion of the tree canopy of public trees that is within the property where a project is undertaken is included in the measurement of tree canopy on the subject property.
(5)
New trees. The tree canopy of a new tree is based on the expected critical root zone of a mature tree of a certain species, without consideration of the amount of overlap. See section 5-404(c)(7) for the canopy coverage value of permitted species of trees. In order to be included in the forty (40) percent canopy coverage, a new tree must meet all the standards provided in section 5-404(c).
(6)
Trees impacted by land disturbance. If land-disturbing activity in connection with a project impacts more than twenty (20) percent of a tree's critical root zone, that tree's canopy cannot be included in the tree canopy calculations above.
(c)
New trees. Newly planted trees must meet the following standards in order to be included in the calculation of tree canopy coverage.
(1)
Minimum 3-inch (DBH) at time of planting.
(2)
Meet or exceed the standards of ANSI Z60.1 Standards for Nursery Stock.
(3)
Meet or exceed minimum tree spacing standards of section 5-404(c)(8).
(4)
Conform to planting methods shown in City of Avondale Administrative Guidelines and Standard Details for the Tree Preservation Ordinance, current ANSI A300 Standards for Tree Care Operations, and ANSI Z133 Safety Standards.
(5)
Be a permitted tree species identified by the city on a list or approved in writing by the city tree official.
(6)
A minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of newly planted trees shall be hardwood species.
(7)
Credit towards meeting tree canopy coverage shall be determined based on the species of tree, according to a list adopted by resolution of the board of mayor and commissioners and maintained at city hall.
a.
Greater canopy trees. Newly planted trees of the greater canopy species provide one thousand nine hundred (1,900) square feet of tree canopy coverage credit.
b.
Lesser canopy trees. Newly planted trees of the lesser canopy species provide one thousand two hundred (1,200) square feet of tree canopy coverage credit.
(8)
Minimum tree spacing requirements.
a.
In order to receive credit for tree canopy coverage, newly planted trees shall meet the following spacing standards:
i.
Minimum spacing (centerline to centerline) of newly planted greater canopy tree from nearest existing or newly planted tree: Forty (40) feet.
ii.
Minimum spacing (centerline to centerline) of newly planted lesser canopy tree from nearest existing or newly planted tree: Twenty (20) feet.
iii.
Minimum set back measured from centerline of newly planted tree to nearest point of buildings, structures, above ground utilities, and easements for underground utilities: Ten (10) feet.
iv.
Minimum set back measured from centerline of newly planted tree to nearest edge of paved or other impervious surfaces: Five (5) ft.
v.
Minimum area of pervious surface surrounding each newly planted tree: Three hundred sixty (360) square feet.
b.
When the city tree official determines that a project cannot meet these standards to achieve a minimum forty (40) percent tree canopy coverage as provided in section 5-404(a), the project shall comply through the property owner making a contribution to the City of Avondale Estates Tree Bank, as provided in section 5-406(a).
(d)
Critical root zone protection.
(1)
In order to prevent harm or damage of trees during development activity, temporary tree protection fencing shall be installed during construction. Tree protection fencing shall surround the critical root zones of existing trees that are outside the limits of approved land disturbance.

(Ord. No. 18-05, § 3(Att.), 10-22-2018)
Sec. 5-413. - Standards of tree preservation and replacement.
(a)
Minimum required canopy coverage. A property that is subject to review for a land disturbance permit required in section 20-304 is required to achieve a minimum of forty (40) percent coverage of the protected lot area of the subject property by healthy, mature trees after construction is complete.
(b)
Measurement of tree canopy. The calculation of percentage of tree canopy coverage is based on the ratio of A/B x 100, where "A" is the area of healthy tree canopy provided by existing and new trees, and "B" is the protected lot area of the property subject to a land disturbance permit. The calculation of "A" is based on the sum of existing and proposed new trees, using the following methods for measurement:
(1)
Existing trees. The tree canopy of existing trees is measured from a tree survey as provided in section 5-414(c). The existing tree canopy is the amount of ground within the critical root zone (CRZ) of existing healthy trees on a property that is subject to a land disturbance permit. Dead or diseased trees cannot be included in the tree canopy measurement.
(2)
Overlapping trees. If the distance between two (2) trees is less than the sum of the CRZ's of the two (2) trees, then these are overlapping trees. The tree canopy of existing overlapping trees is determined from a drawing showing the outer perimeter of the CRZs of the group of overlapping trees within the subject property. An estimate of the outer perimeter of the CRZ may be made using grid paper or other method acceptable to the city tree official.
EXAMPLE OF TREE CANOPY CALCULATION FOR 3 OVERLAPPING TREES
(3)
Boundary trees. The portion of the critical root zone of healthy boundary trees that is within the property subject to a land disturbance permit is included in the measurement of tree canopy on the subject property.
(4)
Public trees. The portion of the tree canopy of public trees that is within the property subject to a land disturbance permit is included in the measurement of tree canopy on the subject property.
(5)
New trees. The tree canopy of a new tree is based on the expected critical root zone of a mature tree of a certain species, without consideration of the amount of overlap. See section 5-413(c)(7) for the canopy coverage value of permitted species of trees. In order to be included in the forty (40) percent canopy coverage, a new tree must meet all the standards provided in section 5-413(c).
