An act or omission, willingly or knowingly performed, of a licensee, owner of more than ten (10) percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or of any provision of this chapter will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of his license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter when evidence is submitted to the city clerk that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues. However, in the case of a violation by an employee, evidence must be submitted to the city clerk that the acts of the employee were known to or, under reasonable circumstances, should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or that the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring, or that the licensee fails to properly train or supervise employees to prevent the violation from occurring.

Upon receipt of a complaint for a violation of section 3-7, the police department shall send the establishment's licensee a certified letter advising that a complaint has been received by the city and stating that such acts place the licensing status of the establishment in jeopardy.
(2)
Should the police department not receive postal confirmation of delivery to the licensee within ten (10) days, the officer assigned to the complaint will hand deliver a copy of the previously sent certified notice to the licensee or the establishment's registered agent. The officer shall require the licensee's or registered agent's personal signature to verify that service was effected.
(3)
Upon receipt of a subsequent complaint, the police department shall conduct an appropriate investigation to determine whether the establishment does, in fact, permit or require an employee under the age of eighteen (18) to violate section 3-7.
(4)
Should such a violation be established, the licensee and the person committing the violation shall be cited to the municipal court of the city for the code violation. Further, the police department will prepare an incident report detailing all facts and events concerning the violation. This report, along with a copy of the aforementioned certified notice and proof of delivery, shall be sent to the city clerk for a suspension/revocation hearing.
(i)
Subject to the provisions of this chapter, a violation of section 3-13 by a licensee, or owner of more than ten (10) percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment shall result in license suspension for a period not less than two (2) days which shall be scheduled to include a Friday and Saturday; second violation within a consecutive twelve-month period shall result in license suspension for a period not less than one (1) week; third violation within a consecutive twenty-four month period shall result in license revocation.
(j)
If a licensee or licensed establishment is convicted of violating O.C.G.A. § 3-3-21(a)(1), prohibiting the furnishing of alcoholic beverages to minors, or action is taken against the holder of a license for violating any state or local law relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors, the city clerk shall notify the state department of revenue of such violation or action.
