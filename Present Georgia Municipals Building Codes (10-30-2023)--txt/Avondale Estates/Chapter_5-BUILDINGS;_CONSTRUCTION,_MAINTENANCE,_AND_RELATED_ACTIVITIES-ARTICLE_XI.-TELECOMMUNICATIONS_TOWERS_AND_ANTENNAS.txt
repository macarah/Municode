Sec. 5-433. - Applicability.
Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the city, shall be exempt from the requirements of the article. All licenses, permits and/or leases authorizing such antenna or tower must be approved by the governing authority. This article shall not govern any tower and/or in installation of any antenna, that is less than seventy (70) feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued, prior to the effective date of this article, shall not be obligated to meet the requirements of this article. However, subsection (e) and (f) of section 5-434, are in effect and will apply. Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this article as "pre-existing towers" or "pre-existing antennas." All antenna or tower development activity shall be subject to the requirements of this article.
(Ord. No. 879, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 5-434. - Guidelines and requirements.
(a)
General. This article establishes the following guidelines:
(1)
Location of towers shall be in nonresidential areas;
(2)
The total number of towers or antennas shall be limited;
(3)
Strongly encourage the joint use of new and/or existing tower or antenna sites;
(4)
Strongly encourage users of towers and antennas to locate the structure in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
(5)
Strongly encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes any adverse visual impact on the city. When necessary, aesthetic camouflaging will be required.
The construction and operation of these towers or antennas will enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to deliver such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently.
(b)
Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with existing regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, etc., the dimensions of the entire lot shall control. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
(c)
Existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower permit shall provide to the planning and zoning board an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the city or within one-quarter (¼) mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The planning and zoning board may share such information with other applicants applying for approval or a special use permit under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the city, provided, however, that the planning and zoning board is not, by sharing such information, in any [way] representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. A recommendation shall be made to the board of mayor and commissioners by the planning and zoning board to either approve or deny the permit application request. The board of mayor and commissioners shall consider any recommendation by the planning and zoning board at its next regularly scheduled commission meeting.
(d)
Aesthetics. The guidelines established in this paragraph shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, addressed by the article.
(1)
Subject to applicable FAA requirements, towers shall be painted a neutral color to reduce visual obtrusiveness;
(2)
The design of the tower, buildings and related structures at any given tower installation shall use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
(3)
If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure. This is designed to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive.
(4)
Towers will not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or some other applicable authority. If lighting is required the governing authority will review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that will be the most advantageous to the surrounding views.
(e)
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.
(f)
Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner(s) shall ensure that each structure is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers, as published by the Electronic Industries Association and amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards, and constitutes a danger to persons or property, notice will be given to the owner of the tower, allowing thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within the prescribed time, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.
(Ord. No. 879, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 5-435. - Permitted uses.

(8)
Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in section 5-437(d) of this article.
(d)
Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. Requests for new towers shall not be permitted until the applicant demonstrates that a tower or structure does not presently exist capable of accommodating the applicant's proposed requirements. Evidence submitted to demonstrate the lack of existing towers and/or support structures capable of accommodating the applicant's proposed antenna will consist of, but not be limited to, the following:
(1)
There are no towers and/or support structures available to meet the applicant's request;
(2)
All existing towers or structures do not have the height to satisfy applicant's engineering requirements.
(3)
Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
(4)
The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(5)
The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
(6)
The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(e)
Setbacks and separations. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas.
(1)
Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.
(2)
Towers, guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning setback requirements. Anchors for guide supports are considered to be the same as wall construction.
(3)
In zoning districts other than industrial or heavy commercial, towers over ninety (90) feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter (¼) of a mile from any existing tower that is over ninety (90) feet in height.
(Ord. No. 879, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 5-439. - Security fencing.
Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height. The fence shall be wood (solid) with the finished side facing out which will also include anti-climbing design and/or devices(s).
(Ord. No. 879, § 1, 5-27-97)

(2)
Existing mature tree growth and natural terrain typography shall be preserved to the extent possible. Where towers are located on large wooded lots natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer for adjacent residential property. The city manager shall make this determination after the construction and all fencing has been completed.
(Ord. No. 879, § 1, 5-27-97)
Sec. 5-441. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days the governing authority may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense.
