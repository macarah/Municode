DIVISION 5.2. - USE CLASSIFICATIONS

Sec. 21-5.2.1. - General.
This division contains a description of the use classification system used to classify principal uses in this zoning ordinance.
Sec. 21-5.2.2. - Use categories.
A.
This zoning ordinance classifies principal land uses into right eight (8) major groupings, which are referred to as use categories:
1.
Residential;
2.
Institutional;
3.
Commercial;
4.
Industrial;
5.
Agricultural;
6.
Wireless communications;
7.
Accessory uses;
8.
Temporary uses.
B.
Each use category is further divided into more specific "sub-categories." Use sub-categories classify principal land uses and activities based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions.
C.
Some use sub-categories are further broken down to identify specific use, business, or activity types that are regulated differently than the parent sub-category as a whole.
Sec. 21-5.2.3. - Determination of use categories and sub-categories.
A.
The city manager is authorized to classify uses on the basis of the use category and subcategory descriptions of this section.
B.
When a use cannot be readily classified into a use category/sub-category or appears to fit into multiple categories/sub-categories, the city manager is authorized to determine the most similar, and thus most appropriate, use category/subcategory based on the actual or projected characteristics of the principal use or activity in relationship to the use category and subcategory descriptions provided in this section. In making such determinations, the city manager shall consider all of the following:
1.
The types of activities that will occur in conjunction with the use;
2.
The types of equipment and processes to be used;
3.
The existence, number and frequency of residents, customers or employees;
4.
Parking demands associated with the use; and
5.
Other factors deemed relevant to a use determination.
C.
If a use can reasonably be classified in multiple categories, sub-categories, or specific use types, the city manager shall categorize the use in the category, sub-category or specific use type that provides the most exact, narrowest, and appropriate match.
D.
If the city manager is unable to determine the appropriate use category for a proposed use, the city manager is authorized to deny the request that necessitated the use determination.
Sec. 21-5.2.4. - Use table.
The following apply to the uses outlined in this section. Refer to table 21-5.2.4 - table of permitted uses.
A.
Use permissions categories. Each use may be permitted as of right (P), with supplemental regulations (S), as a conditional use (C), or not permitted (-). Where C and S are used together (C/S), the conditional use is required to comply with the supplemental use regulations in addition to any additional conditions imposed by the conditional use permit approval.
B.
Number of uses. A lot may contain more than one (1) use and is required to do so, in some cases.
C.
Principal or accessory uses. Each use identified in any of the first six (6) use categories: residential, institutional, commercial, industrial, or agricultural, may function either as a principal use or accessory use on a lot, unless otherwise specified.

2.
Sexually oriented businesses, as a subcategory of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
3.
Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one (1) area.
4.
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
5.
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.
C.
Prohibited locations. It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated a sexually oriented business in the city that is located:

2.
