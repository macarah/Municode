Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or other menace, and land shall not be subdivided until adequate public facilities and improvements exist and proper provision has been made for drainage, soil erosion, water, sewerage, and capital improvements such as schools, parks, recreational facilities, transportation facilities, and improvements.
(c)
The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be properly related to the proposals shown in the comprehensive plan, official map, and the capital budget and program of the city, and it is intended that these regulations shall supplement and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and standards contained in building and housing codes, zoning ordinances, the comprehensive plan, and thoroughfares map.

(8)
To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions in order to further the orderly layout and use of land, and to ensure proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided land.

(10)

(5)

Dead-ends and cul-de-sacs. Only residential lands may be dead-end roads. Such roads shall exceed 1,000 feet in length, not including the turnaround, and no streets may branch off any cul-de-sac. Dead-end roads must terminate in an improved turnaround as defined in the development standards of Athens-Clarke County transportation and public works department adopted by reference as if fully set out herein.

Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions.
(7)
Intersection angles. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at an angle as near to a right angle as practical, except where topography requires a lesser angle. Intersection angles shall be no less than 75 degrees and no greater than 105 degrees as measured in any direction from the intersection.

Access to subdivision. All major means of access to a subdivision or major partition shall be from existing streets fully improved to Athens-Clarke County standards, and which, in judgment of the transportation and public works director, have the capacity to carry all anticipated traffic from the development.
(10)
Half streets. Half streets, while generally not acceptable, may be approved when essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision, when in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and when the city engineer finds it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street may be platted within such tract. Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of the half streets.
(11)
Street names. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets in the city or within Athens-Clarke County except for extensions of existing streets. Streets that are an extension of, or are in alignment with, existing streets shall have the same name as the existing street.

Minimum 50-foot-wide open space areas can also be used for block separations when approved by the city engineer.
c.
Block width. Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots. Single-tier lots and through-lots shall be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major traffic arteries or adjacent nonresidential activities, where located adjacent to the external boundary of the development, or where the city engineer determines such lots to be necessary to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen developed to the standards contained in the city zoning ordinance across which there shall be no right of vehicular access, shall be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or nonresidential use. Lots with required planting screens shall meet the minimum lot depth, excluding the planting screen area.
d.
