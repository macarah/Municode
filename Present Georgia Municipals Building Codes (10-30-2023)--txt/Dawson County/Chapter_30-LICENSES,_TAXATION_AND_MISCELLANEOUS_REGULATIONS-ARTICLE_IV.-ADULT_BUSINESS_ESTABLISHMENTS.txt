ARTICLE IV. - ADULT BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 30-394. - Purpose and intent.
The intent and purpose of this article is to regulate the place of operation of adult business establishments as defined herein. This article is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment and adult media establishments. The Board of Commissioners of Dawson County finds that restricting adult business establishments and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate such establishments by delineating zones where adult business establishments are most compatible with other uses and the surrounding neighborhood. The board also finds that requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult business establishment uses and other uses will afford the most protection to residential uses. The board does not intend to deny any person's right to free speech, conduct, or expression protected by the United States Constitution or the Georgia Constitution. The board intends to adopt a content neutral measure to address the undesirable secondary effects of adult business establishments.
