(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-100. - Penalties for violation of chapter.
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter, upon conviction, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment in accord with the limits established in O.C.G.A. ยง 36-1-20.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-101. - Progressive discipline; acceptance of discipline; final action.
(a)
In addition to the penalties set forth in section 6-100, there is available to the director and commission a range of potential disciplinary options concerning actions, misconduct, violations of this chapter or other laws, and failures to take required action on the part of licensees, their agents and employees, and permit holders. The range is generally as follows:
(1)
Written reprimand.
(2)
Probation, or posting a monetary bond, subject to specified conditions.
(3)
Suspension for period of days.
(4)
Suspension for period of weeks.
(5)
Suspension for period of months.
(6)
Suspension for indefinite period until specified conditions are met.
(7)
Suspension for remainder of current term of license/permit.
(8)
Revocation or non-renewal of license or permit.
(b)
The steps outlined above exemplify the steps which may be taken as disciplinary action but the commission retains the authority to vary the severity of the disciplinary action and thus may skip from a lighter discipline to a more severe level as may appear appropriate given the circumstances. The same applies to disciplinary actions which may be taken by the director as to employee permit holders. Factors which may be considered as to licensees or employee permit holders include any factors set forth in this chapter as to mitigating or aggravating violations of this chapter or any other rules, regulations or laws, including, but not limited to, the following: number and severity of offenses, whether there have been other offenses of a similar nature, whether there have been other offenses of any kind within the preceding three years, whether the problem, condition or violation has been remedied or corrected, whether the licensee took appropriate steps prior to the violation to assure that staff and employees were aware of the requirements of the law, whether the violation was committed by the licensee or manager as opposed to by a non-managerial employee, whether the licensee or permit holder recognizes and acknowledges his or her misconduct or actions leading to disciplinary action, and whether a greater or lesser severity of discipline is likely to prevent future violations.
(c)
A licensee or permit holder under this chapter who is notified of proposed disciplinary action may accept the discipline as proposed by executing a written acceptance which waives any right the licensee/permit holder might otherwise have to a hearing.
(d)
Disciplinary action shall be deemed final under this chapter when a written acceptance and waiver is executed as provided for in this section, or, if none is executed, at the time a written notice of decision is mailed to or hand delivered to the disciplined licensee or permit holder.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-102. - Suspension of license.
(a)
The following shall be grounds, in addition to any other grounds set forth in the preceding section, for the suspension of a license issued under this chapter for such period of time as the board of commissioners shall, in its sole discretion, determine appropriate:
(1)
A violation, as demonstrated by evidence or by any adjudication of guilt as described in subsection 6-103(b)(3) by the licensee (or any officer, owner, manager, agent or employee of licensee) of any state or federal law or regulation, or any provision of this chapter or the regulations promulgated under its authority;
(2)
The failure of the licensee and employees or agents of the licensee to promptly report to the sheriff's office any violation of law/breach of peace, disturbance, or altercation occurring on or near the licensee's premises;
(3)
The violation of any law, regulation or ordinance pertaining to alcoholic beverages, distilled spirits, malt beverages and wines, by any employee or agent of the licensee in connection with the operation of the business of the licensee;
(4)
Operation of the business of the licensee in such a manner as to create a public nuisance, or in a manner contrary to public welfare, safety, health or morals;
(5)
Failure to furnish the board of commissioners on request any information or records that would be necessary for use in determining the licensee's compliance and qualifications under this chapter;
(6)
To knowingly sell malt beverages, wines or distilled spirits to any person while such person is in an intoxicated condition; or
(7)
To knowingly sell or offer to sell malt beverages or wines or distilled spirits to any person under the age of 21 years. In any case where a reasonable person could reasonably be in doubt as to whether or not the person seeking to obtain an alcoholic beverage is actually 21 years of age or older, it shall be the duty of the person selling or otherwise furnishing said malt beverages or wine to request and be furnished with proper identification in order to verify the age of such person. Failure to make such a request and to verify the purchaser's age may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether any sale to an underage person was made knowingly. The term "proper identification" means any document issued by a governmental agency containing a description of the person, such person's photograph, or both, and giving such person's date of birth. The term "proper identification" includes, but is not limited to, a passport, military identification card, driver's license, or a state issued identification card.
(8)
Violation of any provision of the Dawson County Code of Ordinances which deal with non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia, e-cigarettes, and alternative nicotine products.
(b)
Whenever this chapter permits the commission to suspend any license issued under this chapter but does not mandate the period of such suspension, such discretion shall be exercised within the guidelines of this subsection.
(1)
No suspension shall be for a period of time longer than the time remaining on such license;
(2)
The following factors shall be considered on any suspension as set out above:
a.
Consistency of penalties mandated by this chapter and those set by the county commission.
b.
Likelihood of deterring future wrongdoing.
c.
Impact of the offense on the community.
d.
Any mitigating circumstances or remedial or corrective steps taken by licensee.
e.
Any aggravating circumstances or failure by the licensee to take remedial or corrective steps.
f.
The licensee's history of compliance or noncompliance with applicable alcohol related laws and regulations.
g.
Whether the licensee established practices and procedures to prevent the violation from occurring and established procedures to properly train and supervise employees to prevent the violation from occurring.
h.
The board, or director in circumstances where the director may have authority to impose adverse action on a license, permit, licensee or permit holder, may do so upon a progressive discipline basis, such that, for example, first, second and third violations result in successively more severe action. The board or director shall be authorized to utilize a more severe adverse action without intervening violations or intervening steps dependent upon the factors which may otherwise be considered under this section, as provided for in section 6-101 herein.
(c)
Any license suspension for greater than 30 days shall require the licensee to remove all alcoholic beverages from the licensed premises. For any suspension of 30 days or less the board may in its discretion require removal of all alcohol from the premises; in the absence of such condition being mandated, the licensee shall secure with lock and chain all refrigeration units containing alcoholic beverages, and remove non-refrigerated alcoholic beverages to an on-premises locked storage area out of view of the public. No sales or service of alcoholic beverages (neither for on-premises nor off-premises consumption) is allowed upon any licensed premises during any period of suspension, nor is "bring your own bottle" practice or brown bagging permitted during suspension.
(d)
Whenever this chapter permits the board of commissioners to suspend or revoke a license, then the sheriff of Dawson County, or the fire chief, the building official or the county manager may, on a temporary emergency basis suspend the license and order the licensee to cease operations until the matter may be scheduled for hearing before the board of commissioners. This may be done only upon a finding by the said official that temporary suspension as in the best interest of the public for safety, health and/or public welfare reasons. If any of the said officials shall exercise this suspension authority the decision to do so, the reasons for the emergency suspension, and the anticipated duration of the suspension, shall be provided to the licensee or its agent in written form as promptly as practicable. The duration of any such emergency suspension shall not exceed a period of ten days, although the board of commissioners may extend the period of emergency suspension at an open meeting after giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard as to the emergency temporary suspension. The county manager, sheriff, building official, fire chief or board of commissioners may lift an emergency temporary suspension at any time.
(e)
Whenever a period of suspension is imposed under this chapter, the commission may determine in its discretion that at the end of the suspension the licensee may only renew operations in accordance with reasonable conditions imposed by the commission either permanently or during a probationary period set by the commission.
(f)
Whenever the commission would be authorized in its discretion to revoke or suspend a license, then it may instead impose a period of probation during which the licensee must operate under such conditions, limitations or restrictions, and subject to such monitoring, as the commission deems appropriate.
