ARTICLE VI. - HOTEL IN-ROOM SERVICE

Sec. 6-70. - License.
(a)
In-room service means the provision of a cabinet or other facility located in a hotel-motel guestroom that contains beer and/or wine only, which is provided upon written request of the guest and which is accessible by lock and key only to the guest and for which the sale of the beer and/or wine contained therein is final at the time requested except for a credit which may be given to the guest for any unused portion.
(b)
Any hotel-motel that acquires this in-room service must also obtain a consumption on the premises license and shall meet the requirements of this chapter.
(c)
No hotel-motel shall be authorized to provide in-room service until it has been issued a special license to do so. A license fee set forth in the Dawson County Alcohol Fees Schedule shall be imposed to provide only beer and/or wine by "in-room service." A license under this article shall not authorize delivery of alcoholic beverages (neither in package nor by the drink) by "room service" style delivery to the room.
(d)
The sale of beer and/or wine by in-room service shall be subject to all restrictions and limitations relative to the retail sale of any alcoholic beverages, except as provided otherwise in this chapter.
