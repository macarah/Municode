ARTICLE XIV. - VARIANCES

Sec. 6-126. - Purpose.
The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of the requirements would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships on the applicant, and the benefits of allowing the variance would outweigh the negative impact on the community.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-127. - Criteria for granting variances
(a)
Variances may be granted for the following categories of standards and requirements of this chapter:
(1)
Minimum distance requirements.
(2)
Requirements relating to the use of licensed servers to dispense and provide alcohol.
(3)
Requirements relating to the service of food in conjunction with the service of alcohol, or any minimum amounts of revenue produced by food sales as a prerequisite for a license.
(b)
No variance will be granted that is in conflict with state or federal law. No variance from the license fees or taxes provided by ordinance will be granted unless specifically provided for by state law.
(c)
Variances may be granted in the sole discretion of the board of commissioners.
(d)
Criteria that will be considered as part of granting a variance:
(1)
Whether a strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified standard or requirement would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship that outweighs the benefit from allowing alcohol sales at variance with the standard or requirement; and
(2)
Whether there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the business involved that do not apply generally to other businesses selling alcohol; and
(3)
Whether the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or materially injurious to the community, giving consideration to surrounding land uses; and
(4)
Whether there is a concern that the granting of the variance would violate any state laws or requirements.
(Ord. of 5-6-2021(1))
Sec. 6-128. - Variance procedures.
(a)
The applicant shall prepare and submit an application setting forth the specific variance sought and the reasons, with supporting data, why variance should be granted, along with any county-adopted fee for such submittal. The planning department, in consultation with the county attorney's office, shall review the application and make a recommendation for approval or denial, along with any recommended conditions.
(b)
A public hearing shall be held to consider the variance at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners. The planning department may require the applicant to provide notice of the hearing to any properties potentially impacted by the variance.
(c)
The board of commissioners shall review the application and the recommendations of the planning department at the public hearing.
(d)
A decision on the variance request shall be the responsibility of the board of commissioners, shall be made at the public hearing, and the decision shall be final.
(e)
Variances may be granted with conditions. The variance shall not be effective if fewer than all such conditions are met by the applicant.
(f)
If a variance is granted, the planning department shall record the exact nature of the variance and the conditions (if any) attached, which variance and conditions shall be included as a written addendum to the applicable license.
