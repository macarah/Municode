Any party aggrieved by a decision, order or ruling of the building official may appeal such decision to the board of construction appeals by filing a written notice of appeal, within 30 days, with the city clerk; however, in any case where the building official has issued an order for the repair, closing or vacating of a building or structure on grounds it is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous so as to constitute a public nuisance, no appeal shall be taken; and the aggrieved party will be summoned to appear for hearing before the municipal court. A ruling by the board of construction appeals shall be deemed final.
(Ord. No. 98-1, § 1(5-9), 3-23-1998)
Sec. 18-57. - Variances.
(a)
In those limited cases where the state minimum standard codes allow a local variance based upon hardship, the board of construction appeals may, upon finding that strict enforcement of the state minimum standard codes would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of such codes and the public interest, grant a variance, subject to finding, in writing, all of the following:
(1)
That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure, or system involved and which are not applicable to others similarly situated;
(2)
That the special condition and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant;
(3)
That granting of a variance will not confer on the applicant any special privileges that are denied by the codes to other buildings, structures or service systems;
(4)
That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system; and
(5)
That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of such codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b)
In granting a variance, the board of construction appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes, including a reasonable time limit in which the variance is required to be commenced or completed, or both. Each decision of the board shall recite the factual findings underlying its decision and the reasons for such decision. A copy of the board's written decision shall immediately be filed in its minutes of the hearing at which the variance was considered and a copy promptly served upon all affected parties. Decisions of the board shall be final, subject to all applicable remedies afforded by law or in equity.

This article shall be known as the "Manchester Blighted Property Ordinance."
(Ord. of 1-8-2018)
Sec. 18-206. - Purpose.
The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services.
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, the mayor and council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 61, Urban Redevelopment, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread.
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

(6)
No property shall be designated as blighted unless the municipal court of Manchester enters an order that finds the property in question meets the criteria described in section 18-208(1), (2) or (3).
