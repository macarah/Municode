In his discretion, the city manager, upon recommendation of the purchasing agent, may delegate to the department head the procurement of items having a cost of less than $100.00 without quotes. Where feasible, however, whenever like purchases are required by more than one department, the purchasing agent shall consolidate purchase orders to receive full advantage of quantity discounts. All other procurement of equipment, material and supplies for which budgetary approval has been given, having an estimated cost of $2,500.00 or more, and not procurable through federal, state or intergovernmental contracts (including but not limited to the department of administrative services, Georgia Correctional Industries Administration, and Georgia Municipal Association Equipment Leasing Programs) shall be competitively bid upon written specifications drawn by the department head in consultation with the purchasing agent, as reviewed and approved by the city manager. The manner of advertisement or bid solicitation, the period bid solicitations remain open, and procedures governing bid openings shall be determined by the city manager in writing prior to issuance of bid solicitations.

Otherwise, as far as may be reasonable and practicable without sacrificing price or quality, preference may be given to state suppliers over out-of-state suppliers. A similar preference may be given to American suppliers over foreign suppliers.
(Ord. No. 92-5, § 1(5), 10-26-1992)
Sec. 2-296. - Prohibited transactions.
Purchases shall not be routinely solicited from suppliers in which any elected or public official of the city is known to hold a pecuniary interest unless the purchasing agent can demonstrate that no other reliable source of supply is available, and the public officer makes written disclosure of such interest and abstains from participation in the consideration of the purchase. All purchases, regardless of amount, from suppliers in which a public or elected official holds a pecuniary interest shall require the approval of the mayor and council.
(Ord. No. 92-5, § 1(6), 10-26-1992)
Sec. 2-297. - Emergency purchases.
