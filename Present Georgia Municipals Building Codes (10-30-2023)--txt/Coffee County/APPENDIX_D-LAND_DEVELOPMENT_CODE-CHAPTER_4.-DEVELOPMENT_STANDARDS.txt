CHAPTER 4. - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

4-1. - Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide development design and improvement standards applicable to all development activity within Coffee County.
4-2. - Responsibility for Improvements.
All improvements required by this Code shall be designed, installed, and paid for by the developer. The nature and extent to which these improvements must be implemented may vary depending on the nature of the development, zoning criteria and other factors, which are set forth within this LDC.
The Developer must construct all streets, roads, alleys, drains, driveways, traffic control, curbs, gutters and any other subdivision infrastructure according to Building and Construction Standards for Roads, Streets and Public Utilities which are set out in chapter 7 of this LDC.
Evidence of adherence to the standards set forth at chapter 7 shall be required before any subdivision infrastructure of any kind is accepted by the County.
To the extent that third party testing shall be necessary to establish adherence to the building standards set forth herein, the cost of testing shall be wholly born by the developer.
No subdivision may be re-subdivided unless it otherwise complies with this ordinance and all other subdivision developmental requirements and the requirements of this LDC.
After the final subdivision plat has been approved, and the developer is thereafter allowed to sell lots in the approved subdivision, no building permit shall be issued for construction of any home in said subdivision until such time as all subdivision construction and infrastructure requirements have been met, and said infrastructure has been dedicated to and accepted by the County.
With respect to the infrastructure standards set forth herein, developer shall be responsible for providing a two-year warranty for all infrastructure components of said subdivision. Said warranty may be secured with a bond, insurance policy, or other security approved by the County. All forms of insurance or bonding must be procured by the developer for the benefit of the County.
No subdivision shall be approved unless the primary means of ingress and egress to the subdivision connects to a public county road with existing right-of-way of no less than 60 feet.
4-3. - Principles of Development Design.
The provisions of this chapter are intended to ensure functional and attractive development. All development shall be designed to avoid unnecessary impervious surface cover; to provide adequate access to lots and sites; to avoid adverse effects of shadow, glare, noise, odor, traffic, drainage, and utilities on surrounding properties; and to increase public safety, health and welfare.

4-7. - Building Height.
4-7.1. Building Height. Building height is the vertical distance measured to the highest point of the building roof from the average finished grade across those sides of a building that face a street.
4-8. - Planned Development Standards.
4-8.1. Definition. A Planned Development (PD) may be a residential PD, a commercial PD, or a mixed-use PD. A PD shall consist of land under unified control which may be planned and developed as a whole, as a single development or as an approved programmed series of developments by multiple developers. A typical PD will include principal and accessory uses and structures that are substantially related to the character of the development itself and to the surrounding area of which it is a part.
Unified control, as used above, shall mean that all land to be included within a PD shall be owned or otherwise under the legal control of the person or legal entity which has applied for the PD zoning district. Such person or entity shall be legally capable of providing a commitment to the County that the PD development will comply with all PD documents, plans, standards, and conditions ultimately approved by the Coffee County Commission.
A PD zoning district shall consist of the approved PD zoning district classification, the PD Concept Site Plan and the PD Final Site Plan, as well as any other plans, drawings, renderings, elevations, maps and documents specifically included as development documents in the approval of the PD by ordinance by the County Commission. The ordinance approving a PD shall be deemed a zoning ordinance. The provisions of the individual PD zoning ordinance shall replace all conflicting development regulations set forth in this Code which would otherwise apply to the development. The PD ordinance shall be recorded in the public records of Coffee County.
The applicant may proceed with development or any land disturbing activities only after a plat is recorded and after certification by the Zoning Administrator that the building plans and other required documents and information substantially conform to all documents approved by the County Commission as part of the PD ordinance. The applicant must also provide evidence that would bind his successors in title to any commitments made for the approval of the PD.
4-8.2. Zoning Map. The boundaries of land zoned PD by ordinance of the County Commission shall be indicated as such on the official Zoning Map of the County.
4-8.3. Location. A PD may be located anywhere in the County.
4-8.4. Minimum Size. The minimum size of a PD is five acres.
4-8.5. General Requirements.
a.
PD standards for circulation, parking, utilities, drainage and other standards shall apply as described in this Code except as specifically modified by the County Commission as part of the PD ordinance.
b.
Open Space. Not less than 25 percent of the PD shall be open space. Required open space may include all common vegetation and landscape areas.
c.
Maximum Building Area. Not more than 75 percent of the total development shall be covered by buildings.
4-9. - Subdivision Standards.
A subdivision is the cumulative platting of real property into six or more parcels, lots, tracts, tiers, blocks, sites, units, or any other division of land, including all division of land involving a new street or a change in existing streets for the purpose of conveyance, except as otherwise excepted or modified herein. (See chapter 4, section 4-9.1).
I. Subdivision Classification Generally. Coffee County shall authorize only four classes of subdivisions: Level 1, Level II, Level III, and Level IV. Each type subdivision varies in its developmental standards and attention must be given by any subdivision applicant that the chosen subdivision developmental classification meets the objectives of the developer. The remainder of this section shall set out the nature and specific requirements for each class of subdivision.
II. Level I Subdivisions. A Level I subdivision is classified for those developments that will, or may in the future, have more than 25 lots or more or 2,640 cumulative linear feet of roadway as measured down the roadway center line.
Any subdivision that has more than 25 lots or 2,640 cumulative linear feet of roadway shall be required to comply with the following:
(1)
Level I subdivisions which fall within this class shall be required to pave all proposed roads consistent with the construction standards set forth in chapter 7 of the Coffee County LDC.
(2)
The procedure for obtaining subdivision approval shall require adherence to zoning regulations set forth at chapter 10. All other aspects of the Coffee County LDC shall also be adhered to when they apply.
(3)
The Final subdivision plat shall not be approved until such time as road construction is complete, an Engineer has submitted to the County a Certificate of Compliance and Completion that the project has been constructed in accordance with the approved documents, and all other applicable standards have been met. The County shall only then approve the final plat and thereupon accept the completed dedicated roadway. Until then, no subdivision of property may occur nor shall any building permits be issued.
III. Level II Subdivisions. A Level II Subdivision is a Multi-Phase subdivision where the First Phase is 25 lots or less and has less than 2,640 cumulative linear feet of roadway.
Any subdivision that has as its objective to, in phases, develop more than 25 lots and greater than 2,640 cumulative linear feet of roadway, shall select this subclass for its development requirements. The purpose of this sub-class is to permit a developer to initiate Phase I of their subdivision without the initial expense of paving its roads. This process is designed to allow a developer to recover some of its initial development cost before being required to pave roads as required herein. To that end, any subdivision falling into this subclass shall be required to comply with the following:
(1)
Any subdivision in this subclass shall consist of multiple phases. This class of subdivision shall require the developer to plan for and obtain approval of all phases of the entire subdivision plan as required by chapter 10 of the Coffee County LDC. However, the development process may proceed in discreet phases as provided for herein.
(2)
The subdivision plan shall permit Phase I to develop 25 or less lots on not more than 2,640 cumulative linear feet of roadway as measured down the roadway centerline without mandatorily paving the roads in Phase I. Phase I roads shall, however, be built to those dirt road construction standards set forth in chapter 7 of the Coffee County LDC.
(3)
The Final subdivision plat for each phase shall not be approved until such time as road construction is complete, an Engineer has submitted to the County a Certificate of Compliance and Completion, and all other applicable standards have been met. The County shall only then approve the final plat and thereupon accept the completed dedicated roadway. Until then, no subdivision of property may occur nor shall any building permits be issued.
(4)
Nothing in this section shall prevent a developer from paving Phase I road(s) from the inception rather than constructing dirt roads. However, if developer chooses to pave all Phase I roads, they shall comply with the same development standards as required of Level I subdivisions.
(5)
A developer shall not be allowed to begin a new phase of development without first notifying the Zoning Administrator of the intent to do so. Developer must adhere to the following standards before proceeding with any new phase of development:
A.
Prior to development of the new phase, developer must pave all unpaved roads initially developed in Phase I.
B.
Likewise, all roads platted in the new phase of development shall at the same time be paved.
C.
All roads to be paved shall be built to the same standards as roads in a Level I subdivision.
D.
The Final subdivision plat shall not be approved until such time as road construction is complete, an Engineer has submitted to the County a Certificate of Compliance and Completion, and all other applicable standards have been met. The County shall only then approve the final plat and thereupon accept the completed dedicated roadway. Until then, no subdivision of property may occur nor shall any building permits be issued.
IV. Level III Subdivisions. A Level III subdivision is classified for those developments that will have 25 lots or less and not more than 2,640 cumulative linear feet of roadway as measured down the roadway center line.
Any subdivision that has 25 lots or less and not more than 2,640 cumulative linear feet of roadway shall be required to comply with the following:
(1)
Level III subdivisions which fall within this class shall be required minimally to construct roads consistent with the construction standards set forth in chapter 7 of the Coffee County LDC which apply to dirt road construction. This Subdivision class may also pave all or part of the road system in the subdivision. Any paved road must also be constructed consistent with the construction standards set for in chapter 7.
(2)
The procedure for obtaining subdivision approval shall require adherence to zoning regulations set forth at chapter 10. All other aspects of the Coffee County LDC shall also be adhered to when they apply.
(3)
The Final subdivision plat shall not be approved until such time as road construction is complete, an Engineer has submitted to the County a Certificate of Compliance and Completion, and all other applicable standards have been met. The County shall only then approve the final plat and thereupon accept the completed dedicated roadway. Until then, no subdivision of property may occur nor shall any building permits be issued.
(4)
This subdivision class shall not at any time be enlarged to exceed the 25 lot maximum or the cumulative linear roadway feet restriction.
V. Level IV Subdivisions: Rural Large Acre Subdivision (RLAS). A level IV Subdivision is classified for those developments that will consist of the subdivision of large acre tracts of land for the purpose of residential single-family development consistent with this LDC and the supplemental standards set out at chapter 5, section 42. The purpose of the RLAS is to permit the subdivision of large tracts of land with a minimum lot size of ten acres per lot and a maximum lot size of 25 acres per lot. The development of a rural large acreage subdivision shall be one in which a street providing access to lots in the development is not dedicated to the public, but is held in common ownership by the owners of the lots. Private drives and streets, whether dirt or paved, shall be constructed consistent with chapter 7 of this LDC and are not maintained by Coffee County. This development is only permissible in the AG Zoning District. Level IV Subdivisions shall be subject to the following restrictions and/or limitations and otherwise meet all other requirements of this LDC:
a.
Development Plans, Roads and Common Areas.
(1)
Any proposed Level IV Subdivision must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for application review and compliance as required by this chapter.
(2)
Any and all roads to be constructed within the proposed subdivision shall allow for a minimum potential construction footprint of 60 feet. All roads shall be surveyed and platted such that they shall be jointly owned by all property owners in the subdivision or by a legally created homeowner's association that will be charged with the responsibility of the ongoing maintenance of any road system developed by the Developer of the subdivision. Until a homeowner's association is legally created and title to said roads conveyed thereto, Developer shall have the joint responsibility to maintain said roads with any landowners having purchased lots therein.
(3)
Streets, private drainage and utility easements, drainage structures, ditches, and pipes shall be constructed and maintained in perpetuity by the landowner(s) or by a legally created homeowner association.

Notes to this effect must be shown on the final plat.
(9)
The owner(s) of the road system in a Level IV Subdivision shall have the responsibility of maintaining their roads at a level which will allow emergency vehicles to access their property to provide those necessary services. Any failure to maintain a Level IV Subdivision road system adequately to permit the delivery of said services, which causes any harm to person or property shall be the sole responsibility of the owners of said road system and/or the inhabitants of said Level IV Subdivision. There shall be no responsibility or liability on the part of the County associated with fully maintained private roads in a Level IV Subdivision. Notes to this effect must be shown on the final plat.
(10)
All common areas envisioned by this chapter shall be surveyed and platted such that they shall be jointly owned by all property owners in the subdivision or by a legally created homeowner's association that will be charged with the responsibility of the ongoing maintenance of any said common areas.

To that end, all solid waste receptacles utilized by citizens living within a Level IV Subdivision shall be delivered to a common area approved by the Zoning Administrator and consistent with an acceptable plan of development which will permit any solid waste vendor to access and dispose of said solid waste. The design of this common solid waste area shall be such that each potential receptacle can be easily accessed and disposed of without unduly burdening the solid waste vendor. The design shall be such that all receptacles shall be screened from public view from any reasonable angle, and said screen shall be constructed of solid wood or masonry. This common area must provide for a paved or concreted receptacle and turnaround area.
(3)
A separate and distinct common area shall be developed which will allow for the construction and placement of mail receptacles as approved by the United States Postal Service. This area or another distinct and separate area may be also designed so as to accommodate the efficient, safe and orderly loading and unloading of bus passengers transported by the Coffee County School System. This common area must provide for a paved or concreted receptacle and turnaround area.
c.

  4-13.8. Paving of Parking Surfaces.
a.
All required parking spaces, access ways and loading zones shall be paved and otherwise constructed in accordance with the applicable ordinances of the County. As an alternative to paving, parking spaces and access ways may be provided on stabilized grassed areas for uses requiring only occasional parking or transitory vehicle storage as needed for recreational facilities, vehicle dealerships, churches, assembly halls and flea markets. Transitory vehicle storage shall occur only in the rear of such facility and shall only be used by the specified vehicle dealership for their own saleable vehicles. Paved parking shall be provided, however for all full-time employees of such uses.
b.
All parking spaces access ways and loading zones shall be maintained in good condition and be free of pot holes, loose or cracked pavement, broken wheel stops, and any other conditions which might be otherwise detrimental to the health or safety of the residents of the County as determined by the County.
c.
Pervious parking surfaces are permitted when the following conditions are met:
(1)
Pervious paving materials and other soil stabilization techniques are used in a manner as to assure that parking will remain functional in heavy rains or drought.
(2)
Pervious paving materials are installed according to manufacturer's specifications, including sub-surface preparation, composition, and density of compaction.
(3)
Sub-surface soil testing must demonstrate that the manufacturer's specifications will be met to allow for percolation and other stormwater functions. A registered professional engineer shall also make inspections and tests as necessary to certify that construction of the pavement is consistent with the approved plans as well as industry and manufacturer's standards.
(4)
Pervious parking areas shall allow stormwater to percolate into the ground as designed as part of an overall stormwater management system and in accordance with the approved site plan.
(5)
Such areas shall be provided with drainage facilities adequate to properly dispose of all surface water run-off.
(6)
Regular maintenance of pervious parking areas is necessary to ensure long-term integrity of function. Sweeping or other recommended maintenance procedures as per manufacturer's specifications must be implemented. If such areas cease to function in providing adequate parking, drainage or cause sedimentation within the drainage system, then paving to normal design standards will be required. In such an event, any credit given towards pervious surface area for the pervious parking will be revoked and pervious areas shall be installed which are comparable to the area credited or revisions to the stormwater management system shall be made as necessary.
4-13.9. Off-Street Loading Requirements. In addition to the parking required for non-residential uses, loading spaces shall also be required. All loading spaces shall be located and screened to avoid nuisance impacts to adjacent areas with special consideration for noise. A sufficient number of loading spaces shall be provided to accommodate the maximum number of buses or trucks to be loaded or unloaded at any one time. Wheel stops or curbs shall be provided to prevent any vehicle using a loading space from encroaching upon unpaved areas or adjacent property.
