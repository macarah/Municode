Sec. 66-21. - Public water system.
(a)
General provisions.
(1)
The public water systems subject to this article are the Oak Park Water System, the Cherokee Hills Water System, any other water system owned, bought, or obtained by the county currently or in the future. All water systems now owned or later acquired by the county will collectively be designated and described as the "Coffee County Public Water System," hereinafter referred to in this article as the county system. This article recognizes that the Cherokee Hills Water System is funded under the same grant as the Oak Park Water System. The renaming of these systems shall do nothing to affect the funding of the same by the USDA under their previous names.
(2)
A consumer shall make application for water service, in person, at the county utilities department in Douglas, Georgia. At that time, the consumer shall make a cash security deposit for water service. The fee for the security deposit shall be as established by the board of commissioners from time to time.
(3)
Each consumer seeking connection to the county system shall pay a connection fee for each desired connection for water service. The connection fee shall be as established by the board of commissioners from time to time.
(4)
Should the county purchase, obtain, or otherwise acquire a water system already in existence, there will be no connection charge for those already connected to and using the existing system at the time of purchase.
(5)
All consumers connected to the county system shall pay those rates for water usage as established by the county board of commissioners. The water rate usage schedule shall be as established by the board of commissioners from time to time.
(6)
All charges for security deposits, connections, water usage rates, penalties and/or charges of any kind associated with connection to the county system are subject to change at any time and without notice to present or prospective consumers; provided the same are amended pursuant to a majority public vote by the county board of commissioners.
(7)
Every residence, business or enterprise of any kind subject to this article shall have its own water connection and meter.
a.
It shall be a violation of this article and a misdemeanor crime to connect another residence or business/enterprise of any kind, to the county system through a single residence/business metering device in order to obtain or provide water to another consumer or business, thereby avoiding paying additional security deposits, connection fees, higher rates and/or to avoid any other charge required for use of the county system.
b.
It shall be a violation of this article and a misdemeanor crime to sell public water to any other person or permit any other household, business or adjacent land owner to use said water except for fire protection or for emergency situations as determined by the county administrator or other county designee.
c.
Any consumer violating this provision shall be subject to the penalties and fines set out at section 66-24.
(8)
Except for fire protection, the county shall not under any condition or circumstance furnish water free of charge to anyone connected to the county system.
(b)
Mandatory connection.
(1)
There shall be no mandatory connection to the county system, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
(2)
Where the county system is available, capacity permits, and it is in the best interest of the county, there will be mandatory hookup to the county system in the following situations:
a.
Where necessary to preclude the use of water obtained from a private well that is demonstrably unfit for human consumption or other intended use;
b.
For any public water system having active service connection accounts which total more than 75,000 or have more than 200 active service accounts per square mile of total area served by any part or component part of the county system;
c.
For any single-family residential property owner or farm which:
1.
Has an existing well water source owned by the user and located on the same tract of land as the residence or farm, and who becomes eligible to connect to a public water system;
2.
Has been mailed written notice, by the county to his mailing address, of the county's intent to require mandatory connection by the resident to the county system, and of his right to opt out of connecting with the county system; and
3.
Where the owner fails to notify the county in writing of their decision to exercise their option to opt out from connection to the county system within 45 days after the date the county mailed its notice of intent to connect the resident to the county system; but
4.
If the county purchases a private water system which services a residence or business, and the user is already connected to the private water system, continued connection to the system then owned by the county shall be mandatory and the consumer shall not have the right to opt out as set out in subsection (b)(2)c.1—3 and nor shall the requirements set out therein be required of the county;
d.
For any project of a public water system for which revenue bonds have been validated, issued, and sold prior to January 1, 2008;
e.
For any public water system funded primarily through a federal or state grant that contains stipulations in such grant requiring the county to levy a charge or fee for water supply services made available but not used, provided events occur on or before July 1, 2007. Thereafter, no state grant, loan, or contract for services funding any project of a public water system shall contain any stipulations requiring the county to levy a charge or fee for water supply services made available but not used or requiring the county to require single-family property owners or farms to connect with or use water supplied by a public water system, except where necessary to preclude the use of water obtained from another source that is demonstrably unfit for human consumption or other intended use. For the purposes of this subsection (b), the term "federal grant" is defined as money provided directly to the county. Federal money provided to a revolving loan fund or to the state environmental facilities authority or such other mechanism shall not be considered a federal grant; or
f.
All new residential subdivisions and/or developments of any kind, institutional or commercial, shall be required to connect to the county system when the county system is within:
1.
A 1,000 feet radius of the nearest property line created by a new subdivision or development; and
2.
It is in the best interest of the county to require connection to the county system, and the county system otherwise has the capacity to accept the new subdivision or development.
It will be the responsibility of the designated county employee of the county utilities department to determine whether mandatory connection is required under this section.
(3)
No subdivision or development shall be permitted or approved by the county or its designee, unless it has first been determined whether the mandatory connection criterion set out in subsection (b)(2) has been evaluated by the county water department and presented to the Douglas-Coffee County Planning Commission, along with the developers request for zoning change, or subdivision approval.
(c)
Consumer's responsibility and liability.
(1)
Water furnished by the county shall be used for consumption only by the individual household or business metered to receive said water, and for those other uses permitted by this article and/or the zoning ordinances of the county which govern the property at issue.

Under normal conditions, the consumer will be notified of any anticipated interruptions of service by the county.
(e)
Access to premises and extensions of system.
(1)
Duly authorized agents of the county shall have access at all hours to the premises of the consumer for the purpose of installing or removing county property, inspecting piping, reading and testing meters, repairs or for any other purpose in connection with the water service and its facilities.
(2)
Extensions of the county system that require piping to cross private property shall be made only when the consumer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be granted or conveyed, to the county a permanent easement of right-of-way across any property traversed by the water lines, or pursuant to the county's rights to eminent domain and condemnation.
(f)
Meter reading, billings, collections, late fees and penalties.
(1)
Bills to consumers for water service shall be mailed out on a monthly basis. Payment for water service is due on the 24th of each month. Bills shall be paid at the county utilities department and a failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from becoming delinquent nor relieve the consumer from payment of same. Failure of the water user to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of penalties.
(2)
A late charge shall be added on the 25th of each month due to nonpayment of the current amount due unless the 24th falls on a weekend or holiday and then the bill will be due on the following business day. The late fee shall be as established by the board of commissioners from time to time.
(3)
Nonpayment of the current amount due and late charge will result in the water being shut off from the water user's property if full payment is not made within 15 days of the due date or the next business day, provided that the due date falls on a weekend or county observed or declared holiday. When water service must be discontinued due to nonpayment, the service will be cut off on the tenth of the month.
(4)
Water service shall not be reconnected until the customer's delinquent bill, including all penalties and reconnection charges, have been paid in full. The reconnection fee shall be as established by the board of commissioners from time to time.

Insufficiency of water supply due to circumstances beyond the county's control;
e.
Legal processes;
f.
Direction of public authorities;
g.
Strikes, riots, fire, flood, unavoidable accidents, or acts of God;

For any other reason provided for by this article.
(g)

If a consumer seeks to discontinue service, the consumer shall give notice to the county, in person or in writing, of said desire and the county will discontinue service with-in 24 hours after notice is received.
(2)
When water service is discontinued for any reason, and all outstanding fees are paid, the consumer's security deposit shall be refunded by the county. If there is any outstanding balance on the consumer's account, the consumer's security deposit shall be applied to the unpaid balance. If the security deposit is greater than the unpaid balance of the account, the consumer's security deposit shall be refunded by the county. If the security deposit is insufficient to cover the account balance, the county may proceed to collect the balance in any manner provided by law for the collection of debts.
(3)
If a consumer abandons the premises without paying all charges associated with the account in full, the consumer's security deposit shall be applied to the unpaid balance. If the security deposit is greater than the unpaid balance of the account, the consumer's security deposit shall be refunded by the county. If the security deposit is insufficient to cover the account balance, the county may proceed to collect the balance in any manner provided by law for the collection of debts.
(h)
Complaint; adjustments.
(1)
If the consumer believes their bill to be in error, the consumer shall present their claim, in person, at the county utilities department, before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The consumer may pay such bill under protest and said payment shall not prejudice their claim. If the consumer believes the meter is inaccurate, the consumer may request the following:
a.
The county will make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a flat fee, which shall be as established by the board of commissioners from time to time.
b.
When the meter is evaluated as set out at subsection (h)(1)a of this section, if the meter is found to over register beyond ten percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made for the reading and the consumer's bill will be adjusted accordingly. If the reading reflects an over registration of less than ten percent, the bill will remain unchanged and the consumer will be responsible for paying the fee associated with the special reading.
(2)
Any decision made by the county utilities department may be submitted to the county administrator for a final decision about the bill.
(3)
If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the county's authorized representative of it, the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his previous bills and/or from other proper data, as determined by the county commission.
