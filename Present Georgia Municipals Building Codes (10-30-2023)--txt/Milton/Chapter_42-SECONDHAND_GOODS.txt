This provision applies to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, and manager. Upon complying with the requirements of this chapter, a work permit ID card, authorizing such person to be a precious metals dealer employee will be issued.

(b)
The following qualifications shall apply to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee and manager:
(1)
No work permit ID card shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the Milton Police Department and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, Social Security Number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt.

(2)
The chief of police or his or her designee shall conduct a Georgia Crime Information Center (GCIC) and National Crime Information Center (NCIC) records check relative to any police record of the applicant.
(3)
In the event the applicant is qualified for employment with a precious metals dealer under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his or her designee shall issue a work permit ID card to the applicant stating that the person is eligible for employment.

No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices for the five years preceding the date of application shall be issued a work permit ID card. For purposes of this article, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall not result in disqualification. Provided, however, that any such offense may be considered if the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.
(5)
No person shall be issued a work permit ID card if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the Milton Police Department for said work permit ID card under this section.
(6)
All work permit ID cards issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his or her designee or the police chief or his or her designee upon discovery of the error.
(7)
Replacement work permit ID cards will be issued within ten days of the date on which the chief of police receives a written request for replacement of a lost work permit ID card, upon paying one-half of the fees charged for work permit ID cards in subsection 42-68(a).
(8)
All work permit ID cards issued hereunder remain the property of the Milton Police Department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the Milton Police Department.
(9)
No precious metals dealer owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the permitted premises (including any temporary location for which a permit has been issued) unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid work permit ID card. Precious metals dealer owners are required by this section to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current work permit ID card. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a work permit ID card, the applicant may appeal the denial of the work permit ID card as provided in this article.
(10)
If it is determined that any person issued a work permit ID card has falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme in the application for the work permit ID card such work permit ID card shall be revoked or canceled.
(11)
Milton employees who are directly involved in the processing and issuance of work permit ID card or in the regulation of precious metals dealer shall not be eligible for a work permit ID card.
(12)
The City of Milton shall expedite the review, processing, and issuance or determination of denial of a new work permit ID card upon the payment of an application fee equal to one and one-half times the ordinary fee set forth in the City of Milton Fee Schedule for a precious metals dealer work permit ID card.

In the public interest and as set forth herein, all precious metals dealers shall maintain records documenting all precious metals transactions as set forth herein.

(2)
A well focused, properly exposed, color digital photograph of all property sold to the precious metals dealer shall be made at the time of acquisition of any article and of the article's serial number, which number shall be clearly visible and readable in the images if imprinted on the article. If the article was never imprinted with any type of serial number, then the image shall show the entire article. All such digital images shall be labeled and stored in such a manner that they are safe from corruption, readily identifiable, and readily available for review.
(3)
The tag bearing the transaction number must remain attached to the item until the property is disposed of by sale, trade, or other lawful means.

(7)
All precious metals dealers shall obtain from each person selling, bartering, or trading any property, the fingerprint (using an electronic digital fingerprint scanner) of the right hand index finger, unless such finger is missing, in which event the print of the next finger in existence on the right hand shall be obtained with a notation as to the exact finger printed. The fingerprint shall be imprinted onto the transaction form in the designated area along with the signature of the person selling, bartering, or trading the property. The fingerprint must be clear and legible. In the event that more than one transaction form is required, a fingerprint and signature shall be obtained for each form. Fingerprints and the information required herein shall be obtained each time such person sells, barters, or trades any property.
(8)
Items of property that appear to be new, unused, and in their original packaging cannot be accepted by the precious metals dealer unless the customer can supply a copy of the original sales receipt, or other proof of purchase from the place of purchase, to the precious metals dealer who shall retain the receipt or proof of purchase on file.
