Sec. 4-1. - Purposes.
(a)
Purposes. This chapter is adopted as part of a comprehensive plan designed for the purposes, among others, of:
(1)
Promoting the health and general welfare of the community;
(2)
Establishing reasonable and ascertainable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages;
(3)
Protecting and preserving schools and churches; and
(4)
Giving effect to land use and preserving certain residential areas, with reasonable consideration being given to, among other factors, the character of the areas and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, the congestion in the roads and streets, and the promotion of desirable living conditions and sustained stability of neighborhoods and property values.
(b)
Because the purposes of this chapter are not advanced when alcoholic beverages are provided to the general public under an appearance that such alcoholic beverages are not being sold but are being given away as part of a business operation or other activity, any person providing alcoholic beverages to the general public, whether for sale or otherwise, must be licensed by the city.
