Footnotes:
--- (9) ---
State Law reference— Annual budget generally, O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3 et seq.; adoption of budget, O.C.G.A. § 36-81-6.

Sec. 2-344. - General budget policies.
(a)
The budget process provides the primary mechanism by which key decisions are made regarding the levels and types of services to be provided within estimated resources. Budget policy guides this process. Budget policy also directs the city's financial health and stability. O.C.G.A. § 36-81-2 et seq., provides the budget requirements for state local governments.
(b)
The information contained in subsection (d) of this section provides an outline of the city's application of those laws. The city's goal will be to adopt operating budgets where current revenues equal anticipated expenditures once operating reserves are met. All departments supported by the city resources must function within the limits of the financial resources identified or available specifically to them. A balance must be struck between revenues and expenditures, so that the public can realize the benefits of a strong and stable government. It is important to understand that this article is applied to budget entities over periods of time which extend beyond current appropriations.
(c)
By law, budgets cannot exceed available resources. The term "available resources" means revenues generated in the current period added to balances carried forward from prior years. Temporary shortages, or operating deficits can and do occur, but they are not tolerated as extended trends.
(d)
Budget policy information.
(1)
Scope. This division applies to all budgeted funds, which are the responsibility, and under the management of the city.
(2)
Financing current costs. Current costs shall be financed with current revenues, including the use of authorized fund balances. The city is prohibited from balancing current expenditures through the obligation of future year's resources. The city shall strive to avoid short-term borrowing to meet cash flow requirements. However, the city may enter into short-term borrowing should a critical need arise.
(3)
Budget objective by type of fund. The following budget objectives are established for the different funds the city uses:
a.
General fund. The annual budget for the general fund shall provide for general government operations of the city and maintain working capital necessary for the city's financial health and stability.
b.
Special revenue fund. The city adopts annual budgets for each special revenue fund that demonstrates any legally restricted revenue sources are being used consistent with the applicable laws and regulations (e.g., emergency 911 fund, impact fee fund, etc.).
c.
Capital project fund. The city adopts project budgets for each of its capital project funds. These adopted appropriations do not lapse at the end of a fiscal year; rather they remain in effect until project completion or reappropriation by city council.
d.
Debt service fund. The city adopts annual budgets for its debt service funds as applicable. Any remaining fund balances from prior years plus the current year's projected revenues shall be sufficient to meet all annual debt service requirements.
e.
Enterprise fund. Although generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and state statutes do not require the city to adopt budgets for enterprise funds, the city shall adopt budgets for its enterprise funds in order to monitor revenues and control expenses. The city uses a business approach when budgeting enterprise funds. Enterprise funds shall be self-supporting whenever possible and subsidized losses will be minimized when break-even is not possible.
(e)
Additionally, the city classifies funds as either operating funds or nonoperating funds.
(1)
The term "operating funds" means those funds that include appropriations for the payment of salary/benefits and whose maintenance and operating appropriations are necessary to continue the city's daily operations. The term "operating funds" will always include the general fund.
(2)
The term "nonoperating funds" means those funds that do not include appropriations for the payment of salary/benefits and whose maintenance and operating appropriations are not critical to the city's daily operations.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-345. - Operating budget.
(a)
The operating budget shall be prepared on an annual basis and include those funds detailed in section 2-344 that are subject to annual appropriation (all funds excluding the capital project funds). Prior year budget appropriations and prior year actual data will be provided as reference data, with the current year appropriation and projection of expenditures.
(b)
At a minimum, the city shall adopt annual balanced budgets for the general fund, each special revenue fund, and each debt service fund in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3.
(c)
The annual proposed budget should be submitted to the governing authority in accordance with the city's Charter while being held by the city manager's office for public review/inspection in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3.
(d)
Public meetings will be conducted after proper advertisement prior to the city council adopting and approving the annual budget document, as provided by O.C.G.A. §§ 36-81-5, 36-81-6.
(e)
Operating budget information.
(1)
Departmental appropriations. The budget shall be developed based upon line-item expenditures within each department. This type of budget focuses on categories of expenditures such as personal services, contractual services, supplies, equipment, etc., within each department. At a minimum, each department's appropriation in each fund shall be detailed within the budget document.
(2)
Performance budget. In addition to requesting expenditures by line item, the budget document shall include performance budget information.
a.
A performance budget provides information on each of the departments' core deliverables as they relate to services received by the constituents of the city.
b.
A performance budget also utilizes "service efforts and accomplishments" which measure the performance of services rendered and department efficiency/effectiveness on a historical basis and project targets of the indicators for the upcoming budget year.
c.
The city shall strive to maximize services delivered through innovation, efficiency, effectiveness, and industry best practices and reduce, where possible, expenses which do not contribute to the core deliverables, goals, and objectives of the department, organization, mayor and city council.
(3)
Budget preparation categories. Each department shall submit budget requests separately for:
a.
Status quo services. A current services budget is defined as that level of funding which is necessary to provide the same level of service for the upcoming year that is currently being provided. The current services budget will include replacement of capital equipment and maintenance of existing systems.
b.
Enhanced services. An enhanced services budget includes funding requests associated with new services or improved services, including additional personnel or new capital projects/equipment which directly correspond to a core service delivered to constituents identified as a goal of the department, city manager, mayor, or city council.
(4)
Balanced budget. The budget shall be balanced for each budgeted fund. Total anticipated revenues plus that portion of the fund balance in excess of authorized reserves (see subsection (e)(8) of this section) that is designated as a budget funding source shall equal the total estimated expenditures for each fund.
(5)
Basis of budgeting. Neither GAAP nor state statutes address a required budgetary basis of budgeting; however, the city shall adopt budgets in conformity with GAAP for all budgeted funds. All governmental funds shall use the modified accrual basis of accounting and proprietary funds shall use the accrual basis of accounting for budgeting purposes.
(6)
Level of budget adoption and control. All budgets shall be adopted at the legal level of budgetary control, which is the department level within each individual fund. See subsection (e)(11) of this section.
(7)
Budget stabilization resources. The city shall establish adequate fund balances and reserves according to the city's fund balance policy (see division 13 of this article).
(8)
Utilization of prior year's fund balance in budget. If necessary, the city may use the surplus fund balance as a funding source in any given year. The amount of surplus fund balance shall be estimated conservatively, taking into consideration the future year's needs. The utilization of fund balance shall be deemed a use of one-time revenues for budgeting purposes.
(9)
Appropriation lapses at year-end. All operating budget appropriations, including encumbered appropriations, shall lapse at the end of a fiscal year. Purchases encumbered in the current year, but not received until the following year, must be charged against a department's subsequent year appropriation.
(10)
Budget control reports. The city shall maintain a system of budgetary control reports to ensure adherence to the budget. The city will prepare and distribute to the departments timely monthly financial reports comparing actual revenues and outstanding encumbrances and expenditures with budgeted amounts.
(11)
Authorization of budget adjustments and amendments.
a.
The budget is a dynamic, rather than static, plan which requires adjustments and formal budget amendments as circumstances change. The mayor and city council must approve all increases in total departmental appropriations in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3 et seq.
b.
Department heads may submit budget amendment requests transferring appropriations from one line item to another within the specific department appropriation and fund, other than those prohibited in subsections (e)(1) through (10) of this section, and obtain approval from the city manager. Adjustments from appropriations that have been obligated, committed, or reserved for a designated purpose shall not be transferred until a formal de-obligation occurs.
(12)
Contingency line item.
a.
The city shall establish an appropriated contingency of one percent of the total annual expenditure appropriation in all operating funds in order to accommodate unexpected operational changes, legislative impacts, or other economic events affecting the city's operations which could not have been reasonably anticipated at the time the budget was prepared. Nonoperating funds shall not require a contingency reserve appropriation.
b.
This contingency reserve appropriation will be a separate line item within the budget. This amount shall be subject to annual appropriation. The city manager's approval is required before this appropriation can be expended. If approved, the appropriation from the contingency line item to the applicable line item within the applicable department's budget will occur.
(13)
Maintenance and replacement of capital equipment. The mayor and city council will give budget priority to requests that provide for adequate maintenance of capital equipment and facilities and for their orderly replacement.
(14)
Contributions. Outside contributions to programs operated by city departments shall be subject to the city's accounting and budgetary policies. The city welcomes both unrestricted and restricted contributions compatible with the city's programs and objectives. Any material contribution shall be approved and accepted by the mayor and city council prior to the expenditure. Material contributions shall be defined as one-time contributions exceeding one percent of the department's annual maintenance and operating expenditure appropriation or $25,000.00, whichever is less.
(15)
Administrative service fee/cost allocation. Whenever possible, the city may assess an administrative service fee from the general fund to any other fund, based upon documentation and an outside independent study. This assessment will be based upon a percentage of the operating revenues or services provided to the fund and shall be used to reimburse the general fund for the administrative and support services provided to the assessed fund.
(16)
One-time revenue sources. Nonrecurring revenues shall be utilized within the appropriate fund for items relating to nonrecurring expenses. The purpose of limiting these funding sources is to eliminate the fluctuations in funding operations with nonsustainable resources. One-time revenues shall be distinguished during the budget process and budget presentation so that a match can be made with nonrecurring expenditures.

Sec. 2-346. - Cash flow budget.
(a)
Purposes. For analysis and internal management purposes, the city shall prepare an annual cash flow budget in conjunction with the operating budget. The purpose of this division is to provide the necessary guidelines to ensure that cash will be available to pay budget costs on a timely basis.
(b)
Budget allotments. Budget allocations (i.e., budget allotments) are used in the operating budget, when needed to manage cash flows. The annual appropriation may be divided into segments in order to ensure that the projected revenue streams will be adequate to fund the appropriated expenditures. The cash flow budget will provide details as to the periods in which the revenues will be collected, thereby providing for available resources to pay obligations.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-347. - Capital project improvement plan.
(a)
The city will prepare a five-year capital project improvement plan (CIP) which will be updated annually. This plan will assist in the planning, acquisition, and financing of capital projects.
(b)
The term "major capital project" means an expenditure that has an expected useful life of more than three years, with an estimated total cost of $50,000.00 or more, or an improvement/addition to an existing capital asset. The term "major capital project" includes:
(1)
Building/infrastructure construction;
(2)
Park improvements;
(3)
Streetscapes;
(4)
Computer systems;
(5)
Land acquisitions; and
(6)
Heavy duty trucks.
(c)
Major capital projects will be budgeted in the capital improvement fund consistent with all available resources. With the involvement of the responsible departments, the city treasurer's office will prepare the capital budget in conjunction with the operating budget.
(d)
Capital budget information.
(1)
Project length budget. The CIP budget shall be developed based upon defined projects approved by the mayor and city council. Budget appropriation shall include the complete project costs with contingency amounts as appropriate and if available, per O.C.G.A. § 36-81-3.
(2)
Budget preparation. Each department, in conjunction with the mayor and city council, will identify potential capital projects throughout the year. All identified projects will be added to the CIP document, regardless of available funding. These needed projects will provide a method of tracking and planning for the city's future needs. Every effort will be made to identify those projects committed by the city council through legislative action.
(3)
Budget control reports. The city shall maintain a system of budgetary control reports to ensure adherence to the budget. The city will prepare and distribute to the departments timely monthly financial reports comparing actual revenues and outstanding encumbrances and expenditures with budgeted amounts.
(4)
Authorization of budget adjustments and amendments. The reallocation of budgetary appropriations for capital projects shall occur when the project having available funds is substantially complete or the priority of the project has changed. All obligations and encumbrances shall be covered prior to any transfer being completed. Unused appropriations from existing projects can only be used for those projects deemed necessary and acceptable recipients of appropriations during the annual budget process. Projects receiving appropriations shall be the next in line for funding, based upon the existing project priority at the time the appropriation occurs. The city manager shall review and approve all requests for budget adjustments.
(5)
Appropriations at year-end. Capital project appropriations shall carry forward to the subsequent budget period an equal amount of any encumbrances/purchase orders issued as of the close of the fiscal year plus any unencumbered amount. Purchases encumbered in the current year, but not received until the following year, must be charged against each department's subsequent year carryover appropriation. Any remaining appropriation available by project at year-end must be reappropriated.
(6)
Contigency account. The city shall include an appropriated contingency of three percent of the total annual expenditure appropriation in the capital project fund in order to accommodate expenditures that may not have been expected during the duration of a capital project. Expenditure of contingency funds shall only be authorized in accordance with the change order policy outlined within the purchasing section of the financial management program. All contingency budgets shall be subject to annual appropriation.
