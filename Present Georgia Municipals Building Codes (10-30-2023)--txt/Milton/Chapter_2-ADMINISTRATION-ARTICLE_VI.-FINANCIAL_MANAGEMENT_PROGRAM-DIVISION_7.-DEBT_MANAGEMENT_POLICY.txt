DIVISION 7. - DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICY

Sec. 2-503. - Purpose; findings.
(a)
Goals. The goal of this division is to:
(1)
Maintain a sound fiscal position, thereby only utilizing long-term tax-exempt debt (the "debt") to provide resources to finance needed capital improvements, while accumulating adequate resources to repay the debt; and
(2)
Maintain and improve the city's credit rating through strong financial administration.
(3)
To comply with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations related to the issuance of debt.
(b)
Acknowledgments.
(1)
The city acknowledges that failure to meet the demands of growth may inhibit its continued economic viability, but also realizes that excess outstanding debt may have detrimental effects on the ability of the city to meet its continuing operational needs. Issuing debt commits the city's revenues several years into the future, and may limit its flexibility to respond to changing service priorities, revenue inflows, or cost structures. Adherence to this division helps ensure that the city issues and manages its debt prudently in order to maintain a sound financial position and protect its credit rating.
(2)
Credit ratings are the rating agencies' assessment of the city's ability and willingness to repay debt on a timely basis. Credit ratings are an important indicator in the credit markets and can influence interest rates a borrower must pay. Each of the rating agencies believes that debt management is a positive factor in evaluating issuers and assigning credit ratings. Therefore, implementing debt management practices will be viewed positively by the rating agencies and could influence the city's credit rating and ultimately lower borrowing costs.
(c)
Scope. This division applies to all debt issued by or for the benefit of the city and its related entities.
(d)
Responsibility. The city treasurer shall be administratively responsible for this division. The city treasurer shall be responsible for reviewing the requirements and responsibilities of the city under this division with bond counsel on or before the closing date of any debt issued by the city.

Sec. 2-504. - Conditions for issuing debt.
(a)
Long-term. Debt financing for capital improvements and equipment will be generally used when at least one of the following conditions exist:
(1)
When one-time, noncontinuous projects (i.e., those not requiring annual appropriations) are desired;
(2)
When the city determines that future users will receive a benefit from the capital improvement that the debt financed;
(3)
When the project is necessary to provide basic services to the city residents;
(4)
When the total debt, including debt issued by overlapping governments (i.e., the county), does not constitute an unreasonable burden to the taxpayers; and
(5)
Exhaustion of the use of all other possible revenue sources provides no alternative funding for capital projects.
(b)
Short-term. The city will limit its short-term borrowing to cover cash flow shortages through the issuance of tax anticipation notes.
(Ord. No. 06-11-05, 11-21-2006)
Sec. 2-505. - Sound financing procedures.
When the city utilizes debt financing, the following will occur to ensure that the debt is soundly financed:
(1)
Analysis of the financial impact, such that the issuance of debt keeps within the following guidelines:
a.
Total tax-supported debt as a percentage of total taxable full value will not exceed 1.75 percent; and
b.
Total tax-supported debt service as a percentage of general government operating revenues will not exceed 15 percent.
(2)
Conservatively projecting the revenue sources that the city will use to repay the debt;
(3)
Ensuring that the term of any long-term debt the city incurs shall not exceed the expected useful life of the asset the debt financed; and
(4)
Maintaining a debt service coverage ratio (i.e., for revenue secured debt) that ensures that the revenues pledged for the repayment of the outstanding debt will be adequate to make the required debt service payments.
