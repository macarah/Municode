Sec. 46-125. - Restrictions on ready-mix concrete trucks.
(a)
It shall be unlawful to operate any ready-mix concrete truck on the public roads of the city in such a manner so as to result in the spillage or leakage of concrete or similar debris onto any city road or walk. In the event of any such spill, it shall be the duty of the owner and operator of the truck to report the spill to the city department of public works within 24 hours of the spill. In addition, the owner shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the city in removing the concrete and/or repairing the roadway. In the event that the owner fails to reimburse the city for such costs within 30 days after written notice, the city may pursue any and all civil remedies available to the city at law or in equity to recover its costs, including reasonable attorney's fees. Criminal prosecution for any violation of this article shall not relieve any owner from the obligation to reimburse the city for such costs; nor shall payment of such costs bar criminal prosecution for any violation of this article.
(b)
In addition to those prohibitions listed above, it shall be unlawful to operate any ready-mix concrete truck on the public roads within the city unless such truck is equipped with a chute enclosure, or some other mechanism which precludes the leakage of concrete and other debris from leaking or escaping from the truck while traveling through or within the city. For purposes of this article, the term "truck" is defined to mean any vehicle with two or more axles used primarily for the purpose of transporting materials and products.
(c)
The chute enclosure must meet the following requirements:
(1)
The device must be 100 percent effective in keeping debris from coming out of the chute when the device is engaged;
(2)
The device must be rigid, open and close, and lock and unlock automatically when the flop chute is lowered or raised;
(3)
The device shall have no parts which may become clogged with concrete;
(4)
The device must close the chute at the end and seal it completely. No debris shall be able to escape and fall from the chute while the truck is traveling;
(5)
The device shall be coated with a reflective paint, tape or logo so that it is clearly visible at night; and
(6)
The device shall be permanently attached to the chute of each truck.
(d)
Any person, firm or corporation who violates any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction, shall be fined according to the penalties described in section 1-8; and each violation thereof shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such; and each day that a violation continues shall be punishable as a separate offense.
