In order to more efficiently provide for the safety of persons and vehicles traveling on the county roads, and the maintenance of roads in the county, the board of commissioners does ordain and enact into law the provisions of this section, as allowed under O.C.G.A. § 32-4-42(6).
(b)
When a utility company, private company, or an individual plans to place any type utility wire, line, cable, conduit, pipe or any other object under ground along the rights-of-way of the county's roads, streets or easements, they must first secure a written permit from the board of commissioners.
(c)
Application for a permit for utility facility encroachment shall be presented to the board of commissioners with a sketch or plan attached indicating the exact location of subject line, conduit, etc. The application form can be secured from the county road superintendent's office.
(d)
Any type utility wire, line, cable, conduit, pipe or any other object to be laid underground shall be placed a minimum of three feet deep and placed as close as possible along the back side of the right-of-way. Unless otherwise approved by the board of commissioners, all water pipes, sewer pipes, etc., shall be placed on the right side of the road (as one drives north to south or east to west); and all telephone, electrical and other cables, etc., shall be placed on the left side of the road (as one drives north to south or east to west). Any variance to this directive must be approved by the board of commissioners prior to construction.
(e)
When the board of commissioners shall reasonably determine that any pipe, main, conduit, cable, wire, pole, tower or other signal, and other equipment, facilities or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over or under the public roads of the county should be removed or relocated, because it has become an obstruction or interference with the use and safe operation of a county road, or will become an obstruction or interference with the use and safe operation of a contemplated county road, a written notice shall be directed to the utility company giving at least 60 days' notice in which to make such change as is necessary for removal or relocation as may be necessary. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal procedures within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other activities necessary to the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the commissioners may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten days from receipt of such final notice. If such removal has not begun, or if such removal has begun and the relocation has not been completed within a reasonable time, the county commissioners may remove or relocate the same with its own employees, or by contracted labor, tools, equipment, supervision, or other necessary services or materials and whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation, and the expense thereof shall be charged to the utility. The expense shall be certified to the county attorney, who shall have the authority to proceed with suit against the utility for same if payment or arrangements to make payment are not made within 60 days.
(f)
Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deprive any utility, relocated from a location in which it owned a property interest, of compensation for such property interest.

(2)
Any solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch, manure, bones, hair hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
(3)
Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or greater than 10.0 or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW. A user that discharges less than 50,000 gallons per day of process wastewater, may be allowed to discharge wastewater having a pH not less than 5.5 or greater than 11.0 as determined and approved by Harris County.
(4)
Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant Section 307(a) of the Act, Sara Title III or TTO list.
In the event of toxicity being found in the POTW, Harris County may at its discretion require industrial users to participate in a toxicity reduction evaluation in accordance with the provisions of the Harris County NPDES permits.
(5)
Any pollutants that are noxious, toxic or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or an acute hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(6)
Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in non-compliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used.
(7)
Any substance, which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit or the receiving stream water quality standards.
(8)
Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating Harris County's NPDES permit.
(9)
Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in POTW treatment plant resulting in interference or heat in amounts along with corrosive characteristics of the wastewater, accelerate corrosion of the collection system piping or pump station structures and/or pump station equipment, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the public sewer which exceeds 65.5° C (150° F). Also prohibited is any wastewater with a temperature which will cause the temperature at the POTW influent to exceed 40° C (104° F).
(10)
Any slug discharge of wastes, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference to the POTW.
(11)
Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
(12)
Any petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.

(b)
National Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N are hereby incorporated. Certain industrial users are now or shall become subject to these categorical pretreatment standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged into the POTW. All industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standard may also be subject to the limitations established in column B of section 7-77(c) or by the State of Georgia. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for existing sources shall be subject to the requirements in section 7-80(n) of this division. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for new sources shall be required upon promulgation of the standard by the Environmental Protection Agency.
(c)
Limitations on wastewater strength and flow rate. No person or user shall discharge wastewater in excess of the concentration set forth in column A below unless a special permit condition is issued with their wastewater discharge permit. Special permit conditions may be issued for the following reasons:
(1)
The user is in compliance with categorical pretreatment standards, and the receiving plant's influent wastewater characteristic is within the guidelines established to protect the treatment plant operations and receiving stream water quality.
(2)
In the case whereas the industrial user will have to construct or build a system to treat its effluent to within the permitted limits, a compliance schedule may be set forth for a particular industrial user to comply with permitted limits.
(3)
For industrial users having discharges of less than 10,000 gallons per day, a mass limit may be applied based on the maximum acceptable concentration at a flow of 10,000 gallons per day.
Tabulated in column B are the maximum concentrations of the indicated constituents that are allowed in the waste stream at the influent of a treatment facility. Should these concentrations be exceeded, the discharge limits of the industrial users may be reduced below the limits in column A. The industrial users may be required to reduce their concentrations to alternate limits set by Harris County to ensure that the level in the POTW influent does not exceed the concentrations in column B.

Any industry subject to these federal standards shall be required to meet the established limits through a permit issued by Harris County. In addition, Harris County may limit the discharge of other specific substances not listed above on a case-by-case basis, if the discharge of that substance is shown to interfere with the operation or performance of the receiving POTW or violates any receiving stream water quality standards.
(d)
Dilution prohibited. No user shall increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by Harris County or the state. Harris County may impose mass limitations on an industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(e)
Accidental discharges. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to Harris County a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences as required by CFR 403. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division to other applicable law. Any user may be required by Harris County to prepare and submit for approval a spill prevention/contingency plan. A spill prevention/contingency plan must address, at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;

Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to Harris County for review, and shall be in compliance with the provisions of this division before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to Harris County under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to Harris County as in compliance with the provisions of this division prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
(g)
Hazardous waste notification.
(1)
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and is readily available to the user: identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, and estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notifications under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 7-80(c)(9) of this division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under self-monitoring requirements of section 7-80(c)(5) of this division.
(2)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3)
In the case of any new regulations under 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify Harris County, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of such regulations.
(4)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(5)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. No hazardous waste may be discharged without prior approval by Harris County.
(h)
Slug discharges. At least once every two years, Harris County shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a slug control plan. For the purposes of this subsection, a slug discharge is any discharge of non-routine, episodic nature, including, but not limited to a non-customary batch discharge. Harris County may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan for the control of slug discharges. Alternatively, Harris County may develop such a plan for any user. A slug discharge control plan shall address at a minimum, the following:
(1)
Description of discharge practices, including non-routine and routine batch discharges, lockout procedures for all process tanks and storage tanks;
(2)
Description of stored chemicals in all process areas;
(3)
Procedures for immediately notifying Harris County of any accidental or slug discharges, as required in the above paragraph of this section;
(4)
Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from any slug discharges. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transferring of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

Sec. 7-78. - Fees.
(a)
Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the Harris County wastewater disposal system. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the Harris County schedule of charges and fees.
(b)
Charges and fees. The Board of Commissioners of Harris County may adopt charges and fees and from time to time modify, change, alter, increase or decrease said charges and fees for users of the Harris County POTW. Sewer service charges shall be prepared and rendered with the water bill. Harris County is also authorized to assess a separate fee for industrial users for costs incurred by Harris County and related to the pretreatment requirements of this division. The monthly sewer service charge for users of public sewers including those facilities that are assessed a surcharge as described in section 7-78(c) who are supplied either wholly or in part with water from wells or sources of supply other than Harris County shall be based on the measured waste flow using the rates in effect at the time. The owners of the premises or other interested parties shall install a flow measuring device on their waste discharge lines at no expense to Harris County. The flow measuring device shall be of a type that shall perform within ± two percent of accuracy and shall be located so as to be readily accessible to representatives of Harris County. The flow measuring devices shall be calibrated at least once per six months or whenever requested by Harris County.
(c)
Surcharges. All persons discharging high strength waste into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge set by Harris County, in addition to any sewer service charge, if these wastes have a concentration of BOD in excess of 300 parts per million, suspended solids in excess of 300 parts per million, and/or oil and grease in excess of 100 parts per million (note: oil and grease concentrations in excess of 200 parts per million is a violation of section 7-77(c) of this division). The surcharge rate is established by Board of Commissioners of Harris County based on the pounds of BOD, suspended solids, and oil and grease discharges in excess of the concentrations stated above.
Said high strength waste (as defined above) of each user discharging same into the public sewers shall be subject to inspection periodically. A determination of character and concentration of said waste shall be made semiannually, or more frequently as determined by Harris County. The concentration of BOD and suspended solids determined from these inspections shall be used to compute the monthly surcharges. Harris County reserves the right to use COD concentrations in lieu of BOD concentrations, if the BOD concentrations of the effluent wastestream cannot be obtained due to interference from chemical constituents in the wastestream. Under these circumstances, COD concentrations may be used to determine the BOD concentrations. The laboratory methods used in the examination of the waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR 136.
(d)
Grease, oil and sand interceptors.

In the event of an actual or threatened discharge to the POTW of any pollutant which presents an imminent and substantial danger to the health or safety of persons, or danger of interference with the POTW, Harris County shall immediately notify the industrial user or other person causing or responsible for the condition and request their assistance in abating the same. Harris County may temporarily terminate service of such user or users to abate the condition when such action is reasonably necessary. Such service shall be restored by Harris County as soon as the emergency situation has been abated or corrected.
(2)
Notification of violation. Any person found to be violating any provision of this division shall be served by Harris County with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing reasonable time limit in days, weeks or months, for the satisfactory correction thereof. The user shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease and/or remedy all violations.
(3)
Administrative orders. Administrative orders (AOs) are enforcement documents that direct non-domestic users to undertake or to cease specified activities. The terms of AOs may or may not be negotiated with non-domestic users. AOs are used as the first formal response to significant noncompliance. Four common types of AOs are:
a.
Consent agreements. A negotiated agreement with the IU in which both parties agree to actions to be taken to return to compliance.
b.
Cease and desist orders. A directive to an IU to discontinue an action that is resulting in noncompliance.
c.
Show cause orders. Formal meeting requiring the IU to appear and demonstrate why Harris County should not take a proposed enforcement action against it. The meeting may also serve as a forum to discuss corrective actions and compliance schedules.
d.
Compliance orders (compliance schedules). A time schedule of activities to be completed to return an IU to compliance.
Consent agreements are the first formal response to significant noncompliance in which terms are negotiated with the user. If the consent agreement fails to be effective, other AOs without user negotiation will be used.
(4)
Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the following conditions of this division and/or applicable state and federal laws and/or regulations, is subject to revocation of his permit in accordance with the procedures of section 7-81 of this division:
a.
Failure of a user to report factually the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge;
b.
Failure of the user to report material changes in his operation, or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
c.
Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, testing or monitoring; or,
d.
Violation of conditions of his permit in accordance with the provisions of this division.
(5)
Show cause hearing. Harris County may issue a notice directing a user to appear before the board at a specified date and time to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken in response to a violation of this division, other applicable law or regulation, or conditions in the user's wastewater discharge permit.
The board may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or it may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the board to conduct the hearing and transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, with recommendations, to the board for action thereon.
After the board has reviewed the evidence, it may take action for violations as authorized under section 7-82 of the division.

Injunctive relief. Harris County, Georgia, may file in Superior Court of Harris County, Georgia, or any other appropriate forum a suit seeking the issuance of an injunction, damages, and/or other appropriate relief to enforce the provisions of this division or other applicable law or regulation. Such a suit may include any and all damages suffered by Harris County, Georgia, or the board as a result of any action, omissions, or inaction of any user or other person who causes or permits damage to occur to the POTW, or for any other expense, cost, loss or damage of any kind or nature suffered by Harris County, Georgia, or any branch, department or agency thereof.
(7)
Damaging facilities. No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, remove, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of Harris County or the sewerage work of Harris County, Georgia. Any person violating this provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
(8)
Affirmative defense for upsets.
a.
For the purpose of this section, an upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
b.
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c., below are met.
c.
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
1.
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2.
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and,
3.
The user has submitted the following information to Harris County within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, written submission must be provided within five days):
i.
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
ii.
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;
iii.
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance;
iv.
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof;
v.
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards;
vi.
User shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(9)
Affirmative defense for prohibited discharge. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 7-77 of this division if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
a.
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
b.
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when Harris County was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(10)
Affirmative defense for bypasses.
a.
For the purposes of this section;
1.
A bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
2.
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which cause them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
b.
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs c. and d. of this section.
c.
1.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to Harris County, at least ten days before the date of the bypasses, if possible.
2.
A user shall submit oral notice to Harris County of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be submitted within five business days of the bypass as required per CFR 403. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. Harris County may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
d.
1.
Bypass is prohibited, and Harris County may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
i.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
ii.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and,
iii.
The user submitted notices as required under paragraph c. of this section.
2.
Harris County may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if Harris County determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph d.1. of this section. All decisions on validity of affirmative defenses will be made by the board of commissioners or its designee and such decisions will be final.
