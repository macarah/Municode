ARTICLE VIII. - WETLANDS PROTECTION

Sec. 4-161. - Findings and purpose.
(a)
Findings of fact. The wetlands within this county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space, and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands.
(b)
Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Harris County, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas.
(Ord. No. 05-98, § 1, 3-3-98)
Sec. 4-162. - Definitions.
[As used in this article, the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed thereto:]
Functions: The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: Storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities.
Hydric soils: Soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the USDA Department of Natural Resources Conservation Service.
Hydrophytic vegetation. Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions.
Jurisdictional determination: An official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or in the case of coastal marshlands, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.
Jurisdictional wetland: A wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Wetland: An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
Wetland delineation: The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the corps.
Wetland district: All wetlands within the jurisdiction of Harris County.
(Ord. No. 05-98, § 10, 3-3-98)
Sec. 4-163. - Wetland protection district.
(a)
Application. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the county. The Generalized Wetland Map, and all future revisions, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The Generalized Wetland Map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The Generalized Wetland Map shall be on file in the office of the county department of community development.
(b)
Boundaries. The Generalized Wetland Map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the Generalized Wetland Map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The Generalized Wetland Identification Map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. No. 05-98, § 2, 3-3-98)
Sec. 4-164. - Local development permits.
(a)
Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the Generalized Wetland Protection District without written permission from the county department of community development in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) below or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 1,320 feet of the Generalized Wetland Protection District boundary, as determined from the Generalized Wetland Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.
(b)
Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill association with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices are excepted from these requirements.
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
(2)
