(d)
Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all county employees, employees of other agencies, and the general public.

DIVISION 2. - AQUIFER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Sec. 5-110. - Title, findings, and objectives.
(a)
Title. This division shall be known as the Aquifer Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Harris County, Georgia.
(b)
Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county, and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of stormwater runoff in zones of the surface known as aquifer recharge areas.
Aquifers are susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant aquifer recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within aquifer recharge zones in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
(c)
Objectives. The objectives of this division are to:
(1)
Protect groundwater by prohibiting land uses that generate dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater by ensuring that the development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. No. 07-98, § 1, 3-3-98)
Sec. 5-111. - Definitions.
[As used in this division, the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed thereto:]
Aquifer: A layer or formation of rock beneath the earth's surface that bears significant amounts of groundwater.
Aquifer recharge area: An area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within the aquifer.
Pollution susceptibility: The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, or other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility map(s): Maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources that show the relative susceptibility of aquifers to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium, and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant aquifer recharge area: Areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge area is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type, and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves, and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.
(Ord. No. 07-98, § 12, 3-3-98)
Sec. 5-112. - Establishment of an aquifer recharge area district.

(2)
If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists, the public officer is authorized to file a complaint in the Magistrate Court of Harris County or other court of competent jurisdiction, and shall cause a summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure.

If after such notice and hearing, the Magistrate Court of Harris County determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the magistrate court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order:

"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use and connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
(d)
If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the county are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and

Upon final determination of costs, fees and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this chapter shall transmit to the Tax Commissioner of Harris County, a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner of Harris County or his designee, whose duties include the collection of Harris County taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 4 provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The county or its employee shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county.
(3)
Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county or its employee of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article.
(4)
The redemption amount of any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties and costs incurred by the Board of Commissioners of Harris County in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
(f)
