Easement acquisition and utility encroachment permits.
(1)
It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the city for all facilities which are to be conveyed to the city. This process must be used until off-site sewers have been constructed and accepted. This condition shall override any provision for speed up of house starts such as furnishing a bond to guarantee completion of the street or other appurtenances.
(2)
All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, ten feet on each side of the line; except that when the depth of the sewer exceeds ten feet the required sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to bottom of the pipe. Designs involving utilities sharing a common easement will be coordinated with the utilities to insure adequate separation of utilities and overall easement width is achieved.
(3)
Easement drawings for work outside the development shall be furnished and recorded prior to approval of the sewer plans.
1.
The drawings shall be of size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with the length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole numbers, and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner. Any streets or other existing easements shall also be shown.
2.
The title block shall be shown as follows:
City of Buchanan

LL: District: Section: Date: Revised Date:
3.
New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than 2½ times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher in smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow at a depth of two-thirds pipe diameter.
4.
The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should (as a minimum) be of the size called for in the long range plan. If proposed land use conditions have subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination.
(4)
The engineer shall furnish all appropriate drawings for submittal of any state and federal highways, railroads, power lines, water lines, gas lines, petroleum lines, or any other utility lines on which the sewer construction will encroach. The drawing shall normally be 8½ inches by 11 inches or 8½ inches by 14 inches and shall show a plan view and profile view. The drawing will show the same information required for easement drawings. Also, the drawing will show the right-of-way of the existing street or utility, the owner's designation of the line, the name of the nearest intersection or mile post or tower number and the distance to that appurtenance. The clearance distance between the street surface or the bottom of the rail, or the utility and the sewer will be shown. The drawing will also contain any other special information required by the controlling authority of the facility on which the sewer is encroaching. A minimum of five copies of the utility encroachment drawing will be furnished with the plans when they are submitted for approval. The engineer is also responsible for furnishing a completed encroachment permit application if required ready for signature. Construction permits will not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been met.

(b)
Access to project. Authorized representatives of the city, including city employees, city engineer, state or federal agencies shall have access to the site for inspection at any time.
(c)
Communications during construction.
(1)
A preconstruction conference will be required for all projects. The developer has sole responsibility for scheduling the conferences. The developer, design professional, contractor, and subcontractor(s) are required to meet with the city and all private utilities in the conference. The contractor will notify the city in writing 24 hours before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The contractor shall request the final inspection.
(2)
The city inspector may have informal verbal communication with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the action's of the contractor's workmen.
(d)
Concealed work. The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances.
(e)
Minimum inspection by developer. The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer:
(1)
Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring as-built distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole.
(2)
Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed; any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done.
(f)
City inspection. Cost for all testing shall be paid by the developer.
(1)
Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, and proper setting of frame and cover.
(2)
Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least 80 percent of a full circle when observed from one end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked. This section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags and a television camera pulled through the section to check for sags. Any sag holding more than 1½ inches of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine failing sections of sewers.
(3)
Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole will be 100 gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits.
(4)
Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two tests per 50 feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these test show failing results, the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted, and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well.
(g)
Other testing requirements. The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the city. The city will be notified at least two days prior to these tests.
(1)
Mandrel test for PVC Pipe. Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable defection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to 95 percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter):
a.
Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel.
b.
During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line. (A nylon ski rope is recommended.)
c.
After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe.
d.
Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered.
e.
Draw the mandrel through the sewer line.
f.
All increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs, mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine location of failing sewers.
g.
Retest.
(2)
Air pressure test. A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs):
a.
Temporarily plug the line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested.
b.
Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure if any.
c.
Wait at least five minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure.
d.
Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure.
e.
Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure.
f.
The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less that shown by the following chart:
EXPAND
Pipe DIA
Inches Seconds Per
100 Feet of Pipe Pipe DIA
Inches Seconds per
100 Feet of Pipe
4 6 27 77
6 17 30 85
8 23 36 102
10 28 42 119
12 34 48 136
15 43 54 153
18 51 60 170
21 60 66 187
24 68 72 204
  1.
Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirements.
2.
Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until city witnesses a successful test on each line segment.
Note—Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to 100 gallons per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe.
(3)
Manhole testing. All manholes require testing be either the vacuum test or exfiltration test.
a.
Exfiltration test. Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of the ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration is two gal/ft. of manhole diameter.
b.
Vacuum test. Vacuum testing of manholes for water tightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten inches of mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure test shall be monitored for a period of 60 seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine inches or greater, it has passed; if the vacuum drops below nine inches, the manhole has failed.
(h)
Final inspection and conditional acceptance.
(1)
In no circumstances shall any building and plumbing fixtures be connected to a developed sewer system until the system is inspected and approved by the city.
(2)
The contractor shall request a written final inspection, which will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project.
(3)
After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the 24-month warranty period which is required of the contractor.
(4)
On projects having phased development, this letter allows the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development.
(i)
Maintenance bond. The developer shall post a maintenance bond on the facility for a two year period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the city.
(j)
Maintenance until final acceptance. It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for an 24-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the city. At the end of the 24-month maintenance period the city shall inspect the sewer system and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the city, the city will accept the sewer system for operation.
(k)
At the end of the 24 months, the subdivision inspection team will again re-inspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue a final acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewage system.
