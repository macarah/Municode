(b)
In addition, any use that may be compatible with existing uses in the area where it is proposed and is consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning district wherein it is proposed to be located, but is not expressly permitted or prohibited by Article VII for the relevant zoning district, shall require the approval of a conditional use permit.

Sec. 324. - Procedure for public hearings required by the Zoning Procedures Act.
Whenever the city council conducts a public hearing in connection with a zoning decision, as required by O.C.G.A. Section 36-66-4, the following procedures shall be observed:
(1)
Speaker registration. The applicant for rezoning (or other zoning decision) will automatically be registered to speak in support of the application. Any other person wishing to speak, either in support or opposition to the application, shall register with the city clerk. Registration may be accomplished through the city website between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on the day of the hearing, or in person at City Hall beginning one (1) hour prior to the start of the meeting during which the public hearing will be held ending five minutes prior to the start of the public hearing. The speaker's registration shall indicate whether the person registering to speak wishes to speak in support or opposition to the application. The city clerk shall create and maintain a list of proponents and opponents registered to speak at a public hearing and the order in which they registered.
(2)
Total time allotted for public hearing. Before the public hearing is opened for public comments, the mayor (or presiding officer) shall announce a total time allotted for the public hearing. The total time allotted shall be no less than twenty (20) minutes (ten (10) minutes per side) and no longer than one (1) hour (thirty (30) minutes per side). At all public hearings, the proponents and opponents of the application shall collectively be allotted equal time to present their views to the city council.
(3)
Time allotted to each registered speaker. The total time per side allotted for the public hearing (per subsection (2)) shall be equally divided among registered speakers. Except for the applicant, each speaker shall initially be limited to a maximum of three minutes to speak. In the event that all registered speakers on one side of an application have had an opportunity to speak and a portion of the total time for that side (proponents or opponents) remains unused, registered speakers will have an opportunity to speak again within the total time allotted for their side, restarting at the beginning of the registration list.
(4)
Order of public comment at hearing.
a.
Proponents. The city council shall first hear from the proponents of the application. The applicant will have the first opportunity to speak. Then individuals that registered to speak in support of the application shall have the opportunity to speak, in the order that they registered.
b.
Opponents. After the proponents' comments are complete, the opponents shall have the opportunity to speak. Individuals that registered to speak in opposition to the application shall have the opportunity to speak, in the order that they registered.
(5)
Public hearing not an opportunity for dialogue. The public hearing is strictly for proponents and opponents to express their opinions regarding the application to the city council. Speakers shall not direct questions to the applicant, mayor, council members or city staff during the public hearing. City council members may wish to question the applicant and/or proponent(s) and/or opponent(s) of the application as part of the council's consideration of the application. However, any such dialogue will be conducted outside of the public hearing portion of the meeting.
