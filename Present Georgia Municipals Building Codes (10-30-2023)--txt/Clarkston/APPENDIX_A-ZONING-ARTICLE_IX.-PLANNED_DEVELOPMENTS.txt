ARTICLE IX. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS

Sec. 901. - Purpose of planned unit developments.
Planned unit developments encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than on a lot-by-lot basis. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and flexibility in design. The city gains the advantages of variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plan by the city provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located.
(a)
Purpose and definition. Planned unit development is defined as two (2) or more buildings to be constructed on a tract or several tracts of land of the minimum size established in section 903. The purpose of the planned unit development shall be to:
(1)
Provide for unified approaches to the development of land;
(2)
Provide for a simplified process of enabling development which would otherwise require numerous applications for variations from the provisions of the zoning code;
(3)
Provide for the development of stable environments that are compatible with surrounding areas of the community; and
(4)
Assure the provision of park and recreation land and facilities for the use of the occupants of the development.
(Ord. No. 358, §§ 1, 2, 3-1-11)
Sec. 902. - Ownership control.
(a)
All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by an individual, by a corporation or by some other legal entity until development of the project is complete.
(b)
After the development is complete, as a precondition to obtaining certificate(s) of occupancy for building(s) in the planned unit development, the developer shall either:
(1)
Record a final subdivision plat that creates a separate lot for each dwelling place and subjects each lot in the development to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed and require maintenance of the common areas, if applicable, by the owners of the subdivided lots; or
(2)
Record a condominium declaration pursuant to the Georgia Condominium Act.
(c)
Common areas shall be required for four or more homes and owned by a condominium association, homeowners' association or jointly by the owners of the individual parcels within the planned development.
( Ord. No. 414 , § 1, 8-2-17)

(2)
Failure to act. If the planning and zoning board fails to submit a report within thirty (30) days after it has received the proposed planned development application, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval to the mayor and city council. The planning and zoning board and the applicant may jointly agree to a thirty-day postponement, provided that notice of such agreement shall be sent to the mayor and city council. In any case, all materials concerning the proposed planned unit development shall be forwarded to the mayor and city council no later than sixty (60) days from the receipt of an application certified as complete.
(d)
City council hearing and final action. At the next regularly scheduled meeting after the zoning and review commission has conducted an application review and recommendation, the mayor and city council shall review and consider the proposed application and materials for a public hearing.

If the proposed planned unit development is deemed acceptable for further consideration, the city council shall hold a public hearing thereon. The notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing in the official legal organ of the city or in the official legal organ of DeKalb County. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.

The mayor and city council and the applicant may jointly agree to postpone action for a forty-five-day period but the final decision shall be made not later than sixty (60) days from the public hearing.
(e)
General standards for approval. Planned unit developments may be approved subject to such conditions as may be imposed in order to mitigate impacts which may be expected without the imposition of conditions. The following general standards shall be considered in determining whether the planned unit development shall be approved:
(1)
Is the proposed development suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property?
(2)
Does the proposed development adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
(3)
Does the proposed development result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools?
(4)
Are there other existing or changing conditions which, because of their impact on the public health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community give supporting grounds for either the approval or denial of the proposed development?
(f)
Preliminary and final land subdivision plats. Final approval of the planned unit development by the mayor and city council authorizes the applicant to prepare a preliminary land subdivision plat when applicable. A copy of this authorization together with a copy of the materials submitted by the applicant shall be sent to the planning and zoning board.
(1)
No site development shall be undertaken by the applicant and no permits shall be issued to him/her until the preliminary land subdivision plat has been officially approved by the planning and zoning board and the mayor and city council in accordance with the Clarkston land subdivision regulations (chapter 17 of the City Code).

A final land subdivision plat shall be prepared by the developer after approval of the preliminary plat.
(3)
If the final land subdivision plat meets the requirements of subdivision regulations of the city, it shall be approved by the zoning and review commission and the mayor and city council and recorded in accordance with land subdivision regulation procedures.
(g)
Modification of approved planned unit developments: The mayor or his/her designee shall have sole authority to approve minor changes to approved planned unit developments. For the purposes of this section, a minor change in the approved planned unit development means a slight alteration to a planned unit development or change in layout that does not result in the visible intrusion of any building, structure, driveway, walkway, parking lot, plaza, wall or similar built element into any open space, yard, landscaped buffer, undeveloped space, or any similar space, when any such space is shown on the final "conditional" plan as being next to and visible from a property line or street.
