A credit card agreement may provide for the acceptance of the credit card payments from the credit card company at a discount from the face amount of the payment or for the withholding of administrative fees from the face amount of the payment. Such discounted fee is granted in exchange for the improved governmental cash flow, reduction of administrative expenses and increased public convenience as a result of credit card payments.

If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation for the money due is not extinguished. All applicable penalties, interest and collection fees on the unpaid amount shall be due from the person making the payment by credit card. Such penalties, interest and fees on an unpaid amount shall accrue from the date the unpaid obligation was first due under the applicable statute or ordinance. The city shall follow the collection procedures for the unpaid amount that would have otherwise been applicable had the credit card payment not been attempted. Nothing contained herein shall alter or restrict the right of the city to place a lien upon any property within the city where such liens are authorized under the Charter or other ordinances of the city.

Sec. 8-26. - Credit card payments for fines.
It shall be unlawful for any person to tender a credit card for payment of a fine arising from the violation of any city ordinance or state statute if such person knows or has reason to believe that the charges made will not be paid by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction. If final payment on a credit card payment for a fine resulting from violation of any city ordinance or state statute is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation for the money due is not extinguished. In such event, the person who tendered the credit card for payment shall be in violation of this article and may be held in contempt of court by the judge of the mayor's court, and/or punished pursuant to the provisions of section 3.06 of the Charter.
