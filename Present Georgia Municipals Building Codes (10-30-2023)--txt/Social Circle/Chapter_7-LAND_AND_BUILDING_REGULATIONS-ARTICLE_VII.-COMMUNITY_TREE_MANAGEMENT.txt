ARTICLE VII. - COMMUNITY TREE MANAGEMENT

Sec. 7-261. - Title.
There is hereby established a community tree management ordinance chapter for the City Code, also known as the "Tree Ordinance".
(Former § 7-011(1.))
Sec. 7-262. - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of the tree ordinance is to promote a healthy and sustainable community forest in the city for the benefit of citizens, visitors, and business owners. Trees, especially large, canopy trees, provide many economic, environmental, and social benefits to our community. Trees produce oxygen and help reduce the amount of airborne pollutants; they provide shade, lower air temperatures, reduce low level ozone production, and improve air quality. Trees reduce energy usage and costs. Trees reduce stormwater runoff and soil erosion, decrease sedimentation in streams and rivers, and improve water quality. Trees reduce glare and soften the harsh lines of pavement, buildings, and other hardscape. Trees increase property values. Trees improve human health and enhance outdoor recreation opportunities. Trees provide food and shelter for wildlife. Because trees provide these and other important and irreplaceable benefits, the city has adopted these regulations which contain minimum requirements for tree conservation, protection, establishment, maintenance, inspection, and removal.
(Former § 7-011(2.))
Sec. 7-263. - Administration.
The city manager or designee shall be the administrator of this article.
(Former § 7-011(3.))
Sec. 7-264. - Applicability and exemptions.
The provisions of this article shall apply to any activity on city-owned property and to any activity on any real property that requires the issuance of a land development permit, excluding the following:
(1)
Activities on existing single-family and duplex residential properties when there is an existing structure on the property, unless the activity expands the footprint of the structure. If the property is vacant, this exclusion shall not apply.
(2)
Construction or maintenance of public utilities within utility easements.
(3)
Detention ponds and drainage easements.
(4)
Agricultural operations including land clearing for legitimate agricultural purposes, and not pursuant to land development in the following five years.

Tree canopy cover requirements.
a.
For any development that requires a land development permit a minimum amount of tree canopy cover is required on site as set forth in Table 2. The tree canopy cover requirements vary by zoning district, take into account the maximum allowable lot coverage, and are represented as a percent of the entire site area exclusive of large truck traffic and storage areas in Zones I-1 and I-2.
b.
In addition to the overall minimum requirement, a minimum amount of tree canopy cover shall originate from the conservation of existing trees if adequate trees are present on the site. When no trees are present on a site or an inadequate number of trees are present on a site, then the tree conservation portion of the tree canopy cover requirements shall be satisfied through the establishment of additional trees.
c.
Satisfactory compliance with tree canopy cover requirements shall be required before a certificate of occupancy can be issued.

(3)
Existing tree canopy cover credit. The amount of tree canopy cover that shall be credited to an existing tree is the actual tree canopy cover as measured in the field or the standard tree canopy cover credit for the species found in the tree species list, whichever is greater.
a.
Only healthy trees that will be protected per the administrative and technical standards are eligible for tree canopy cover credit. The determination of whether a tree is healthy shall be made by the administrator, who may seek, or require the applicant to provide, an opinion of a certified arborist or registered forester. Tree canopy cover credit will not be given to unhealthy trees or trees with greater than 35 percent crown dieback or trees that are not structurally sound and at risk for whole or partial tree failure.
b.
Individually growing healthy canopy trees 18 inches DBH and larger that will be protected according to the administrative and technical standards are eligible to receive three times the maximum tree canopy cover as described above at the reasonable objective discretion of the tree board based on written criteria and findings of fact.
c.
The tree canopy cover credit assigned to a tree to be established on a site is based on the tree canopy size category for the species defined in the tree species list in the administrative and technical standards. Species with the potential for large tree canopies are eligible for a credit of 1,600 square feet of tree canopy cover; trees with medium-sized canopies are eligible for a credit of 900 square feet of tree canopy cover; trees with small canopies are eligible for a credit of 400 square feet of tree canopy cover; and trees with very small canopies are eligible for a credit of 150 square feet of tree canopy cover.
(4)
Tree conservation requirements. To satisfy tree conservation requirements individual trees may be conserved, groups of trees may be conserved, or natural, forested areas may be conserved. Individual trees proposed for conservation must be at least six inches DBH. Tree conservation must comply with the administrative and technical standards. Trees that are conserved must be protected per the administrative and technical standards.
(5)
Protection and maintenance of tree canopy cover. The required amount of tree canopy cover on a site must be present on the site in perpetuity, with the exception of single- and two-family residential properties in new subdivisions once construction is complete and the property is owner-occupied.
a.
Tree conservation areas for which credit has been received shall always remain as tree conservation areas. No activities that disturb the soil or vegetation can take place within tree conservation areas except the planting of trees.
b.
Tree protection zones must be established around all individual conserved trees prior to site disturbance and must remain until construction has been completed and the certificate of occupancy has been issued. Tree protection structures shall be inspected and approved before site disturbance can begin. Standards for establishing tree protection zones and installing tree protection structures are described in the administrative and technical standards.
c.
Trees established to satisfy tree canopy cover requirements shall be regularly maintained and remain healthy to continue to receive credit. If the city determines at any time prior to or after the certificate of occupancy has been issued that a tree has been topped or is not healthy, the city shall require the owner to remove and replace the tree to maintain the required minimum amount of tree canopy cover.
(6)
Payment and penalties to the city tree fund in lieu of conservation or canopy coverage. In cases where adequate trees exist on a site but an inadequate number of trees are proposed for conservation, and after all options for conservation have been exhausted by the applicant, then the city may waive or reduce the minimum tree conservation requirement but shall require in lieu of conservation a contribution to the city tree fund as specified in the administrative and technical standards. Waiver shall be per reasonable objective discretion of the tree board based on written criteria and findings of fact.
When a violation of this article exists and a fine is levied the fine shall be paid to the city tree fund.
a.
When the city has wholly or partially waived the tree conservation requirement, a contribution to the city tree fund in lieu of the conservation shall be required in the amount of $300.00 for every 1,600 square feet of tree canopy cover not conserved.
b.
When the city has wholly or partially waived the tree canopy cover requirement, a contribution to the city tree fund in lieu of the tree canopy cover shall be required in the amount of $300.00 for every 1,600 square feet of canopy not established.
c.
When a city tree is damaged or destroyed the person responsible for the damage is required to reimburse the city for the value of the tree as described in this article; the reimbursement shall be deposited to the city tree fund.
(7)
Tree establishment. The remainder of the tree canopy cover requirement in Table 2 shall be satisfied through new trees in frontage landscape strips and parking areas first, and then in other areas on the site where adequate space and growing conditions exist.
a.
Trees in required buffers may count toward the overall tree canopy cover requirement, if the requirements for frontage landscape strips and parking areas have been met.
b.
When planting more than three trees on a development site, no more than 30 percent of the trees may be of one single genus (oaks, maples, elms, etc.).
c.
At time of planting, trees shall be a minimum of two inches caliper for canopy, upright and single-stemmed trees, and five feet tall for small, spreading or multi-stemmed trees.
(8)
Trees in frontage landscape strips. Trees shall be established in all street frontage landscape strips at a density of one tree for every 40 linear feet of frontage. The largest tree that the growing space can accommodate shall be planted. Required trees may be established in city street rights-of-way with the permission of the tree board. Tree establishment shall conform to the administrative and technical standards.
(9)
Trees in parking areas. To provide shade for pavement and vehicles and reduce summer temperatures and ozone, canopy trees shall be planted in parking areas at a rate of one tree for every 3,500 square feet of parking area. Trees shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking area in landscape islands so that 50 percent tree canopy cover will be achieved when the trees reach maturity. Trees planted around the perimeter of parking areas shall count for one-half of a tree for satisfying this requirement since only one-half of their canopy will cover pavement. These perimeter trees, however, retain full canopy cover credit for the purpose of satisfying overall tree canopy cover requirements.
(10)
Minimum permeable soil area.
a.
The minimum permeable soil areas that must be maintained around trees in paved areas or compacted soils are based on mature tree height category and are as follows:
1.
Small trees: 100 square feet (minimum dimension five feet).
2.
Medium trees: 225 square feet (minimum dimension nine feet).
3.
Large trees: 400 square feet (minimum dimension nine feet).
b.
These minimum permeable areas may be reduced by 50 percent if permeable pavement is installed around the CRZ of the trees or structural soils are installed beneath the pavement, in an area equal to the required minimum before reduction, as further described in the administrative and technical standards.
c.
When two or more trees are planted in the same contiguous area, the amount of the combined minimum permeable areas may be reduced by ten percent for each additional tree, but in no case shall be reduced by greater than 50 percent overall.
d.
The minimum permeable open soil area in parking lots for a large maturing tree may be reduced to the size of two parking bays, or a minimum of 324 feet.
e.
Minimum permeable CRZ areas around established trees must always remain permeable and shall remain covered in mulch as described in the administrative and technical standards.
(11)
Soil quality. Soil in the minimum permeable soil area of all trees to a depth of 30 inches must be good quality topsoil, well aerated, and composed of approximately 45 percent mineral soil, five percent organic matter and 50 percent pore space.
(12)
Removal of trees from development sites. No trees may be disturbed, damaged, destroyed, or removed from a site prior to approval of a tree conservation plan, except for timber harvesting that is part of ongoing forest management operations (see timber harvesting ordinance). When timber harvesting occurs on a site without an approved tree conservation plan, no development permits of any type shall be issued for the site for five years after completion of harvesting.
(Former § 7-011(13.))
Cross reference— Timber harvesting—Required notice; bonds or letters of credit, § 7-9.
Sec. 7-273. - Tree conservation plan.
(a)
A separate tree conservation plan that demonstrates compliance with this article shall be submitted to the city for review by the tree board in conjunction with the submittal of other required site plans and the application for a land development permit. After review the board shall forward the tree conservation plan to the administrator or designee along with a recommendation for approval or revision. The tree conservation plan will be reviewed by the administrator or designee for conformance with this article and either approved or returned to the applicant to be revised and resubmitted.
(b)
For subdivisions, a tree conservation plan that demonstrates compliance with this article for the development as a whole must be submitted and approved before preliminary plat approval may be granted and before a land disturbance permit may be issued. A tree conservation plan that demonstrates compliance with this article for individual lots in a subdivision must be submitted and approved before a building permit or land disturbance permit may be granted.
(c)
The following information shall be included on the tree conservation plan:
