Sec. 3-2. - Library fund restrictions.
On September 11, 1990, effective date October 1, 1990, the mayor and council of the city established a trust for the benefit of the beneficiary, Social Circle, for its city library, known and described under the trust as the William H. Stanton Memorial Library ("library").
In January, 2017 legal action is being filed to dissolve the trust, because the total revenue, interest, dividends and other cash accumulations to the trust had been consumed by the fees and expenses paid to SunTrust Bank. The superior court is being asked to terminate the trust, and award the entirety of the trust funds to the city. The funds are then to be maintained exclusively and perpetually in a separate earmarked account, solely for the purposes described hereinbelow.
Consistent with said trust, and also with the original testamentary trust, the income only, of the funds from the trust, shall be utilized, and only for the following purposes, with the corpus/principal of the funds being maintained intact in perpetuity:
(1)
Maintenance of the new library building (current or future replacement Social Circle library) which shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of adequate fire and extended coverage insurance on the said building, books, furniture and fixtures;
(2)
Purchase of books for the said library;
(3)
Purchase of items and devices designed to aid persons who are blind, or who have impaired eyesight or hearing deficiencies, so as to enable them more advantageously to use the library; and
(4)
To assist in library problems and needs designated to develop cultural opportunities for the Social Circle community. No more than one-third of the said income may be used in any one year for the purposes set out above.
The city shall maintain the library's name as "The William H. Stanton Memorial Library", in perpetuity, and the conference/meeting room shall be designated and marked in perpetuity as "The Walthour Hall."

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Prior to the reenactment of article III by Ord. No. 2020-9, § 1, adopted June 16, 2020, Ord. No. 2017-14, § 1, adopted July 18, 2017, repealed the former article III, sections 3-76—3-87 in its entirety, which pertained to the code of ethics and derived from the prior code § 3-002(a)—(l).

Sec. 3-76. - Principal policies.
The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office or position to unethically improve his or her own private standing. The principal policies that form the foundation of this code of ethics are as follows:
(1)
The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
(2)
The constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and ordinances of the city should be upheld as a minimum standard of conduct.
(3)
The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is consistently to act with the highest moral principles and react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.
(4)
City officials should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their elected office.
(5)
All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality.
(Ord. No. 2020-9, § 1, 6-16-2020)
Sec. 3-77. - Intent.
It is the intent of this code of ethics that city officials shall not knowingly engage in any activity that is incompatible with the proper discharge of their official duties or which would tend to impair their judgment or actions in the performance of their official duties. Furthermore, city officials should avoid any action that might result in or create the appearance of:
(1)
Using public office or position in an unethical manner for private gain;
(2)
Impeding city efficiency or economy; or
(3)
Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of those who conduct the affairs and business of the city.
(Ord. No. 2020-9, § 1, 6-16-2020)

Immediate family means spouse, child, parent or sibling of a city official.
Incidental interest means an interest in a person, entity or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value.
Remote interest means an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public.
Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where:
(1)
The interest is ownership of five percent or more of the voting stock, shares or equity of the entity or ownership of $5,000.00 or more of the equity or market value of the entity; or

Sec. 3-137. - Bids and proposals.
The two primary procurement methods for the city shall be competitive sealed bidding and competitive sealed proposals. All procurements shall be made via one of these two methods unless the procurement falls under the sole source procurement, or emergency procurement sections above, which serve as exceptions to these two primary methods. The terms and conditions of the purchasing section of the financial policies of the current budget are incorporated into this article as Schedule 1 attached to Ord. No. 2017-21 and incorporated herein by reference.
(1)
Competitive sealed bidding. An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a reasonable time, not less than 15 calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids. The public notice shall state the place, date, and time of bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid and such other relevant information as the city manager deems appropriate shall be recorded. The record and each bid shall be open to public inspection.
Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this article. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids—no other criteria may be used in bid evaluation. Such requirements may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose.
Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, no changes in bids shall be permitted unless the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: (1) the mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident, or (2) the bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit correction or withdrawal of bids shall be supported by written determination by a city official.
The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a given project exceeds available funds as certified by the appropriate fiscal officer, the city manager is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds.
(2)
Competitive sealed proposals. When the city manager, or other relevant department head, determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposals method.
As provided in a request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements.
Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No factors other than those set forth in the request for proposals may be used in the evaluation.
(Ord. No. 2017-21, § 7, 9-19-2017)
Sec. 3-138. - State requirements.
The city hereby incorporates herein by reference the notice, bonding, and other procurement requirements of the state as specified in O.C.G.A. tit. 13, ch. 10 and tit. 36, ch. 91. Any project or contract governed by these statutes shall follow and satisfy the requirements therein, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of this article.
