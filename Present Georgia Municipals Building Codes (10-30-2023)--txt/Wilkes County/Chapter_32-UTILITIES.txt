Capacity. The liquid capacity of septic tanks for single-family dwellings shall be not less than 750 gallons for one or two bedrooms; 900 gallons for three bedrooms; 1,000 gallons for four bedrooms and 250 additional gallons for each bedroom over four. The liquid capacity of septic tanks in on-site sewage management systems for nonresidential usage shall be based on the anticipated daily sewage flow from the facility served, but in no case shall be less than 750 gallons. Septic tank capacity shall be increased by 50 percent where garbage grinders are to be used.
(d)
Compartmented tanks. Compartmented tanks are permissible upon approval by the county board of health.
(e)
Tanks in series. The county board of health may approve the installation of two septic tanks placed in series provided that the capacity of the first tank is at least 750 gallons and at least equal to the capacity of the second tank. When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank.
(f)
Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level, on a foundation that will prevent settling; backfill shall be placed so that a stable fill results and undue strain on the tank is avoided. Earth backfill shall be free of voids, large stones, stumps, broken masonry, or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is recommended. All openings and manholes shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of surface water.
(Res. No. 05081997, att. C(290-5-26-.05), 5-8-1997)
Sec. 32-24. - Distribution boxes and dosing tanks.
(a)
Minimum design and construction boxes.

(Res. No. 05081997, att. C(290-5-26-.06), 5-8-1997)
Sec. 32-25. - Absorption fields.
(a)
Area computation. Absorption trench bottom area shall be based upon the anticipated volume of treated sewage and upon the characteristics of the soil in which absorption fields are to be located as specified in the current on-site sewage management system manual. Soil characteristics and other related data, including percolation tests, may be required by the county board of health.
(b)
Location. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells or springs; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream, or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be crossed by a water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe. No absorption field shall be installed in areas where groundwater, soil characteristics or adverse geological formation may interfere with the absorption of sewage effluent.
(c)
Minimum design and construction for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption lines and absorption trench bottoms shall be true to grade and trenches shall be not less than 25 inches in depth, and shall have not less than 12 inches of earth cover. Maximum length of absorption trench laterals for distribution box systems shall be 100 feet; laterals shall be equal in length and spaced not less than eight feet apart, center to center. Absorption trenches shall be not more than 36 inches wide.
(d)
Field layout methods for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption fields shall be planned and installed in accordance with one of the following methods:
(1)
Distribution box method. On level or sloping topography, the distribution box method may be used, and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A firm earthen or concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to ensure against tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care should be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of six inches, but no more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box. The sewer from the septic tank or dosing tank shall enter the distribution box and terminate inside the distribution box with an elbow turned downward to form a submerged outlet at normal water level, or a baffle may be used, providing the same function is accomplished. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall be not less than one-eighth-inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with the minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer, longer trenches.
(2)
Level field method. On level or slightly sloping topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines inter-connected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting shall be used to inter-connect the absorption lines.
(3)
Serial distribution method. On more severely sloping topography, the serial distribution method may be used. When this method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption lines and terminate at any point in the line so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth.
(Res. No. 05081997, att. C(290-5-26-.07), 5-8-1997)
Sec. 32-26. - Privies.
Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the minimum design and construction criteria established by the current on-site sewage management system manual.
(Res. No. 05081997, att. C(290-5-26-.08), 5-8-1997)
Sec. 32-27. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems and site modifications.
(a)
General information.
(1)
The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health.
(2)
The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on the public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition, including community-managed on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems.
(3)
When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the county board of health:
a.
Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory, or field data required.
b.
Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making application will be informed by the county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures deemed necessary by the county board of health. Reduction of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy.
(b)
Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The department may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site and system specific-factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for a conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system.
(c)
Site modifications. Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage systems, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval, detailed plans showing the type and extent of modifications. The county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit.
(Res. No. 05081997, att. C(290-5-26-.09), 5-8-1997)
Sec. 32-28. - Percolation tests and test borings.
(a)
Percolation tests. If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such tests shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted, will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevations during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems.
(b)
Location and number.
(1)
Percolation test holes should be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in the absorption field area.
(2)
The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be determined by the county board of health. The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristics of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designation, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map.
(c)
Test borings for rock, shale, and hardpan. Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service. Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map.
(d)
Individuals conducting tests. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the county board of health, such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a county board of health representative.

Sec. 32-29. - Septage removal and disposal.
(a)
Septage removal permit. No person shall engage in the removal or disposal of the contents of septic tanks, pit privies, or other on-site sewage management or experimental systems without having first applied for and obtained from the county board of health a septage removal permit, renewed annually, for such activities. The application for such septage removal shall be submitted in writing on forms provided by the county board of health at least ten days prior to engaging in such activities. The application shall include, but not be limited to, the business name and address, name and address of the applicant, the manner by which such contents are to be removed, transported, and given final disposal and such other documentation as may be required by the county board of health, including evidence that septage removed and transported will be accepted at approved disposal sites. If surface spreading, subsurface land disposal or other method of treatment or disposal is to be used, additional information may be required.
(b)
Disposal methods. Approved methods of disposal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be discharged to a public or community sewage treatment system for treatment in a wastewater treatment plant, treatment at separate septage handling facilities, or direct land application. Disposal by any of these methods shall require written permission from both the appropriate governing official, private septage handling facility owner or land owner and a representative of the county board of health.
(c)
Vehicle identification. The name and address of the person or firm engaging in the removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems and the permit number shall be lettered on both sides of each vehicle used for septage removal purposes. Letters and numerals shall not be less than two inches in height and shall be readily visible.
(d)

Sec. 32-32. - Subdivision and mobile home parks.
(a)
Plans required. No person may sell, offer for sale, lease, rent, begin construction or otherwise begin the physical development of a subdivision or mobile home park where public or community sewage treatment systems are not available or contemplated to be available to serve the proposed development until proposals and plans for the water supply and sewage disposal method to be provided or installed have been submitted to and written approval has been obtained from the county board of health.
(b)
Predevelopment review advised. All developers considering subdivision or mobile home park development where public or community sewage treatment systems will not be available are strongly advised to seek a predevelopment review by the county board of health prior to purchasing property and/or making substantial monetary outlays for developmental improvements. Rejection or tentative approval may be obtained at this time by submitting the following information:
(1)
A boundary plat including:
a.
Vicinity map;
b.
A topographic map;
c.
A soil map and soil description.
(2)
Complete subdivision analysis record on forms provided by the county board of health.
(3)
Additional information as required by the county board of health for complete understanding and clarification.
(c)
Proposals and plans. Unless previously provided, subdivision or mobile home park proposals shall be submitted on subdivision analysis forms provided by the county board of health. Subdivisions or mobile home park plans shall be drawn to a reasonable scale, with topography depicted by two-foot contour intervals; provided, however, that if ground slope is sufficiently steep for less frequent contour intervals to show the surface configurations, the county board of health may permit the use of lesser contour intervals. Plans shall illustrate the location of all present and proposed wells, watercourses, floodplains, water systems, sewage systems, roads, structures rights-of-way, and easements on the property and within 100 feet outside the perimeter of the property. Subdivision or mobile home park plans shall also include, stormwater drainage systems, elevations of seasonal high water table, location and results of test borings and percolation tests if applicable, lot identification, dimensions, and building lines. The name and registration number of the preparing surveyor or engineer shall also be on the subdivision or mobile home park plans.
(d)
Soil evaluation. Data used to develop soil maps and descriptions shall be obtained from reliable sources as set forth in section 32-21(i), soil data acceptability. Where reliable soil information or the services of a soil scientist are not available, percolation tests, soil borings, and such other tests as the county board of health may require shall be conducted.
(e)
Limits on use of on-site sewage management systems in subdivision and mobile home parks. Approval of subdivisions and mobile home parks for on-site sewage management systems shall not be granted when:
(1)
An available sewer of a public or community sewage treatment system is within 500 feet of the subdivision or mobile home park.
(2)
Soil maps, descriptions, and reports compiled by the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or a soil scientist indicate that soil conditions prohibit safe development with on-site sewage management systems, or the average percolation rate for the subdivision or mobile home park is more than 90 minutes per inch.
(f)
Drainage. Where on-site sewage management systems are proposed for use, an adequate surface water drainage system shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Plans for drainage shall comply with local storm drainage plans and policies in effect in the city and/or county at the time of submission to the county board of health, and approval of drainage plans by the local governing body is a prerequisite to county board of health approval. Additionally, any changes or amendments to approved drainage plans must receive the concurrence of the governing agency, and the county board of health shall be provided with a written approval statement from the governing agency. In the absence of local drainage policies, the county board of health will evaluate drainage plans and render decisions on their acceptability. Plans for internal drainage (subsurface drainage), if used, shall be submitted to the county board of health for consideration as to their acceptability.
