--- (1) ---
Editor's note— A resolution adopted Jan. 3, 1995, relative to organization of meetings of the board of commissioners, not specifically amendatory of this Code, has been treated as superseding, in effect repealing, former §§ 2-1001 and 2-1004 and enacting new provisions in lieu thereof which have been added as §§ 2-1001—2-1022. Former §§ 2-1002, 2-1003 and 2-1005 have been renumbered as §§ 2-1023, 2-1024 and 2-1025, respectively, to accommodate the inclusion of the new provisions. Formerly, such superseded sections pertained to annual organizational meeting; election of chairman and vice-chairman, and regular meetings, special meetings, quorum of members and voting, and derived from F-77, adopted Feb. 4, 1975, and Ord. No. 91-2, § 1, adopted Apr. 16, 1991.

Prior to the recognition of any citizen for comments related to the citizen comment section of the agenda, the chairman shall read the following statement:
"Speakers must sign up prior to the meeting and provide their names, addresses and the topic they wish to discuss. Speakers must direct your remarks to the Board and not to individual Commissioners or to the audience. Personal disagreements with individual Commissioners or County employees are not a matter of public concern and personal attacks will not be tolerated. The Chairman has the right to limit your comments in the interest of disposing of the County's business in an efficient and respectable manner.
Speakers will be allotted three (3) minutes to speak on their chosen topics as they relate to matters pertinent to the jurisdiction of the Board of the Commissioners. No questions will be asked by any of the commissioners during citizen comments. Outbursts from the audience will not be tolerated.

Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a board meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for commissioners. Individuals who violate any rules of the board may be ruled out of order by the chairman or on a point of order made by a commissioner. A majority vote of the board will rule on the point of order. An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairman.
(d)
Public hearings. The board may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board.

Prior to the recognition of any citizen for comments related to the public hearing agenda, the chairman shall read the following statement:
"At this time, I will recognize those citizens who have signed up to address the Board. Once your name is called, come to the podium, state your name and address for the record and make your comments. All speakers who are recognized will be allotted three minutes. No speaker will be permitted to speak more than three minutes unless the Board votes to suspend this rule.
We look forward to your comments and in no way mean to diminish anyone's right to speak freely, to advise use about an issue relevant to the public hearing, to let us know how you feel about a matter that is under consideration, or to request that we address some problem you have with the issue at hand.
Please direct your remarks to the Board and not to individual Commissioners or to the audience. Personal disagreements with individual Commissioners or County employees are not a matter of public concern and personal attacks will not be tolerated. The Chairman has the right to limit your comments in the interest of disposing of the County's business in an efficient and respectable manner."
