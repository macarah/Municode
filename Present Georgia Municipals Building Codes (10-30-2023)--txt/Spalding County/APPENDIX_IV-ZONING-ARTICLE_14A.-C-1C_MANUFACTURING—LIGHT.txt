ARTICLE 14A. - C-1C MANUFACTURING—LIGHT[6]

Footnotes:
--- (6) ---
Editor's note— Section 1 of a resolution adopted Mar. 4, 1997, renumbered this article, which was formerly numbered Art. 14, C-1B Manufacturing-Light, §§ 1401—1404, as Art. 14A, C-1C Manufacturing-Light, §§ 1401A—1404A.

Sec. 1401A. - Purpose.
C-1C zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low-intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of non-manufacturing activities from C-1C districts benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.
(Res. of 3-4-97, § 1)
Sec. 1402A. - Boundaries of C-1C districts.
The official map (Section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all C-1C districts within Spalding County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
