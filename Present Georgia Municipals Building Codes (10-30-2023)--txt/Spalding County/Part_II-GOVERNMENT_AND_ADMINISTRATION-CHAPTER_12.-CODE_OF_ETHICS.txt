Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— Sec. 2 of Ord. No. 2022-002 , adopted July 18, 2022, amended ch. 12 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 12 pertained to the same subject matter, consisted of §§ 2-12001—2-12004, and derived from Ord. No. 2013-02, adopted March 4, 2013.

Sec. 2-12001. - Purpose.
The members of the Spalding County Board of Commissioners acknowledge that holding public office is a public trust, and that the public interest must be their primary concern regardless of personal considerations. The members of the board of commissioners recognize that, when acting as a body, they are the governing authority of Spalding County, Georgia. As a board, they possess the full power of local government, both legislative, executive and quasi-judicial, within the parameters established by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia. As individual commissioners, however, each member acknowledges that he/she has no legal power or authority, and that official action can exist only by majority vote of the board of commissioners. Accordingly, it is important and in the public interest to establish a code of conduct for Commissioners that addresses conduct both during and outside of public meetings. This chapter is adopted to preserve the integrity of local government, to promote the efficiency with which local government services are provided, and to protect Spalding County from exposure to liability due to conduct that is unauthorized or beyond an individual commissioner's authority.
The proper operation of local government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that the government decisions and policy be made through proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; that the public officials be free from the appearance of impropriety; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. The purpose of this policy is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the county and by directing disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the county.
This chapter is intended to adopt and incorporate herein for local enforcement the ethical standards of O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1 and O.C.G.A. § 45-10-3, as may be amended from time to time.

This chapter is intended to adopt and incorporate herein for local enforcement the ethical standards of O.C.G.A. § 45-10-1 and O.C.G.A. § 45-10-3, as may be amended from time to time. Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, each member of all boards, commissions, and authorities created by general statute shall:
(1)
Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or government department.
(2)
Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion.
(3)
Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay and give to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.
(4)
Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished.
(5)
Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not, and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties.
(6)
Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty.
(7)
Engage in no business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties.
(8)
Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.
(9)
Expose corruption wherever discovered.
(10)
Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.
(11)
Never solicit, accept, or agree to accept gifts, loans, gratuities, discounts, favors, hospitality, or services from any person, association, or corporation under circumstances from which it could reasonably be inferred that a major purpose of the donor is to influence the performance of the member's official duties.
(12)
Never accept any economic opportunity under circumstances where he knows or should know that there is a substantial possibility that the opportunity is being afforded him with intent to influence his conduct in the performance of his official duties.
(13)
Never engage in other conduct which is unbecoming to a covered official or which constitutes a breach of public trust.
(14)
Never take any official action with regard to any matter under circumstances in which he/she knows or should know that he/she has a direct or indirect monetary interest in the subject matter of such matter or in the outcome of such official action.
(b)
Further, each covered official shall:
(1)
Promptly pay when due all ad valorem taxes due to the City of Griffin, Spalding County and the Griffin Spalding County School System.
(2)
Promptly file any disclosure required by the State of Georgia for public officials as well as pay any fees or penalties which may be assessed by the State of Georgia within ninety (90) days of receiving official notice from the State of Georgia of such fees or penalties.
(3)
Not knowingly state or withhold any information that would impair the proper decision making of the board or any of the county's boards, agencies, authorities or departments.

Not request or permit the unauthorized use of county-owned vehicles and equipment, including, but not limited to, computers, cellular telephones, materials or property for personal convenience or profit.
(5)
Neither cause the dismissal nor threaten the dismissal from any county position as a reward or punishment for any political activity.
(6)
Not direct any person employed by the county to undertake political activity on behalf of such covered official, any other county official or employee, or any other individual, political party, group, or business organization during such time that the employee is required to conduct county business.
(c)
Social media. The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for covered officials who post information to and access personal web pages or social networking technology. Social media can take many forms, including text, images, audio and video. The intent of this section is not to prohibit covered official's personal expression on the internet; however, a covered official's on-line presence reflects upon the county and as such he/she should be aware that actions captured via images, posts or comments may discredit them and/or the county or adversely affect the efficiency or integrity of the county. Covered officials should be aware that information posted on the internet is not secure or private. Even if active steps are taken to restrict access to a covered official's site. Once information has been posted on the internet, it is generally trackable, traceable and accessible indefinitely. All covered officials should be aware that due to the nature of their service in the public sector, they are held to a higher standard. It is the covered official's responsibility to ensure that the use of social media does not interfere with the county's operations. Covered officials should exercise appropriate discretion, so as not to discredit the county and should refrain from using ethnic slurs, personal insults or obscenity or using language that may be considered hateful, harassing or bullying.
(d)
Annually, each covered official shall take an oath of office and shall covenant and agree to adhere to the provisions of this ethics ordinance.
