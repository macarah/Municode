ARTICLE 21. - S-2 SENSITIVE LAND-WATERSHED PROTECTION DISTRICT[8]

Footnotes:
--- (8) ---
Editor's note— Res. No. A-01-11A, § 1, adopted Aug. 6, 2001, repealed art. 21, §§ 2101—2105, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, art. 21 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the 1995 Code.

Sec. 2101. - Purpose.
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Spalding County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs, in addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering wasters resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of Spalding County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within Spalding County.
Additionally, the S-2 Watershed Protection District is intended to maintain a high water quality of the surface water (rivers, creeks, streams and springs) and underground water to assure that a high quality of drinking water is maintained in the future. The district is intended to provide for certain development uses, while maintaining and protecting area water sources from polluting effects of more intense development and from encroachments of those uses that are not compatible with a protected watershed area.
(Res. No. A-01-11A, § 2, 8-6-01)
Sec. 2102. - Relationship to other zoning districts.
S-2 is an overlay district which applies additional definitions and standards for development to specific areas which lie within any of the zoning districts identified in Articles 5—19 of this ordinance. To the extent the boundaries of the S-2 district overlay property located within other districts, the regulations of both districts shall apply. However if required development standards are specified in both districts, the more stringent provision shall control.
(Res. No. A-01-11A, § 2, 8-6-01)
Sec. 2103. - Definitions.
The following definitions (in addition to those definitions contained within Article 2 of this ordinance) apply to S-2 districts:

B.
Corridor: All land located within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in section 2104 of this article.
C.
Impervious surface: A manmade structure or surface which prevents the infiltration of storm water into the ground below the structure or surface, including (for purposes of example only), but not limited to, buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, swimming pools and patios.

J.
Water supply watershed: The area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake.
