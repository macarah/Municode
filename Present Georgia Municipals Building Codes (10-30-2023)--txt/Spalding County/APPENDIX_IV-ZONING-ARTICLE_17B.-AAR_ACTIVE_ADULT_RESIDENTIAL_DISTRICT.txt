ARTICLE 17B. - AAR ACTIVE ADULT RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

Sec. 1701B. - Purpose.
The AAR district is established to provide for the development of varied housing options for active adults typically over age fifty-five (55) and restricted in accordance with the federal Fair Housing Act and the Housing for Older Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq. and the Georgia Fair Housing Act, O.C.G.A. § 8-3-200, et seq. The development focus in AAR encourages an active adult and senior lifestyle. Development of communities in the AAR district must be of sufficient size to accommodate a variety of residential dwelling types, significant amenities and open space which, when taken together, contribute to an enhanced lifestyle. Limited commercial development, principally community retail and service uses, shall be allowed within the community to serve the residents of AAR districts. However, residential uses must predominate within the AAR community. All development within the AAR district must be comprehensively planned as a unitary development which meets these development goals. The development plan must be sufficiently detailed to insure Spalding County that all residences and accompanying amenities are developed pursuant to a logical and coherent plan from beginning to completion. All development within AAR must be served by public sewer.

The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all AAR districts within Spalding County. Article 23 also contains additional information regarding interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.
