(b)
If the fire or law enforcement personnel at the scene of the activated alarm system determines the alarm to be false, the personnel shall make a report of the false alarm, a notification of which shall be sent by certified mail to the alarm user at the address of the alarm system location, advising the alarm user of the false alarm.
