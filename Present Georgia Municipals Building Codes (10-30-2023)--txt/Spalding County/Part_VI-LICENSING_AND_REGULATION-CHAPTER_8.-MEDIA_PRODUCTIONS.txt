CHAPTER 8. - MEDIA PRODUCTIONS

Sec. 6-8001. - Purpose.
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as the Spalding County. Spalding County is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract movies and television productions to the county.
Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and county cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly-planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit.
(Ord. No. 2016-13, ยง 1, 10-17-16)
Sec. 6-8002. - Scope of coverage.
The permit required under this chapter shall be a requirement for all movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, photo shoots, infomercials and public service announcements, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Any media production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, media production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. No public highway, street or road shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2016-13, ยง 1, 10-17-16)
Sec. 6-8003. - Permit requirements.
(a)
This permit is allowed with conditions in all zoning districts. Whenever a permit is sought for activities in primarily residential neighborhoods, extra consideration shall be given to the conditions imposed to ameliorate as much as possible inconvenience to the residents.
(b)
Two (2) classifications of media production permits are allowed:
(1)
Low-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of no more than fourteen (14) consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses; and
(2)
High-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of fifteen (15) or more consecutive days, which do not comply with the low-impact standards of this chapter, and/or will disrupt normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses. Any filming involving automobile crashes or chases, gunfire, pyrotechnics, explosives, the use of aircraft, stunts, and similar activities are examples of high-impact activities.
(c)
General standards. Prior to making application for a permit, it shall be incumbent on the applicant to meet with the county manager and/or his designee, or their designees, to review locations and the general scope of activities planned during the production. A copy of the script shall be made available, upon request, to allow the county staff to better understand the applicant's needs.
The following general standards shall apply to all permits:
(1)
No tents, temporary sanitary facilities, trash collection, or food service facilities shall be located within one hundred (100) feet of the property line of any property used for residential use, unless the owner or tenant gives written consent;
(2)
Tents, depending on their square footage, and other temporary structures may require a separate building permit from the county; any food preparation or food service provided at the location shall require a food service permit from the county health department, or evidence of exemption;
(3)
Lighting for filming should be oriented away from adjacent or nearby properties as much as possible and shall not interfere with the safe movement of vehicular traffic;
(4)
Temporary signage must be approved in writing, in advance, prior to erection, by the development director, or his designee; approval of temporary signage is conditioned restoration of permanent signage following completion of the media activity;
(5)
No regulatory traffic control signage within a public right-of-way shall be removed without the prior written consent of the Spalding County Sheriff;
(6)
No modification to any existing traffic signage, street light, traffic control device or other officially-installed facility or improvement shall be made without prior consent of the Spalding County Sheriff;
(7)
No street, road, alley, or sidewalk shall be closed, barricaded or other obstruction erected within a public right-of-way, and no access shall be denied or restricted to public or private property or facilities unless the closure or restriction is approved as a condition of the permit; reasonable alternative access shall be arranged whenever possible;
(8)
No trees, vegetation (including grasses), or ornamental shrubs shall be cut or removed from public property without prior written consent of the county in the permit, based upon an agreed landscape restoration plan. A land disturbance permit may be separately required depending upon the nature and extent of the activity;
(9)
Traffic management plan. The applicant shall submit to the Spalding County Sheriff's Office a traffic management plan to address traffic flow in the vicinity of the location where production activity is to occur, even if normal traffic flow is not to be obstructed or interrupted. Detours shall be determined and approved by the Spalding County Sheriff; temporary traffic control devices and signage as required by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices shall be provided at the sole expense of the applicant; the county fire marshal shall also review and approve such plan. Applicant must notify property owners and tenants in the vicinity of their presence, how long they will be there and what effect it will have on their daily routine;
(10)
The Spalding County shall be listed in the production credits for all permits required.

In addition to the general standards, the following minimum standards shall be met in order to be permitted as a low-impact activity.

No permit shall be effective for more than fourteen (14) consecutive dates from its date of issuance. Permits may be extended by the county manager, for reasonable cause, provided a daily filming fee shall apply.

The permit shall be available, on location, at all times while production activity is occurring and shown to county inspectors upon request.

The application shall detail the planned time, place, and manner of any of the following production activities: pyrotechnics, demolition, discharge of firearms or other weapons, motor vehicle chases, physical stunts, and similar actions.
