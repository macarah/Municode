Sec. 70-2. - Zoning hearings.
(a)
Zoning hearings before the board of commissioners shall be public hearings and all discussions and deliberations shall be conducted in open meeting provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit the city council from going into executive session for the purpose of discussing legal questions arising due to the matter under consideration with the city attorney in an attorney-client relationship.
(b)
At the commencement of the hearing, the presiding officer, whether the mayor or the mayor pro tem, or someone designated by the presiding officer, shall give a brief explanation of the matter under consideration and the issue or issues to be determined.
(c)
Following such explanation, the petitioner and proponents of the petition seeking a change in zoning, or the proponents of any other proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance, as the case may be, shall be afforded the first opportunity to present their case and evidence to the board of commissioners.
(d)
After this presentment, all parties in opposition shall be afforded an opportunity to present their opposition and evidence.
(e)
Each side shall have a total of 20 minutes to present their side of the issue. Provided, however, if application is made prior to the beginning of the proceedings by either side the mayor/mayor pro tem in his sole discretion shall extend the time allowed. Provided further, however, each side shall have the same amount of time to present their case.
(f)
After all parties have been so heard by the city commission, the city commission may, but shall not be required to, permit one person from each side to summarize the evidence and arguments of the parties. Summation is limited to ten minutes per side.
(g)
After all parties have been heard and such summaries, if any, have been completed, the city council shall close the floor to open debate and further evidence, whereupon the city council shall consider the issue to be determined and the evidence and arguments presented to it during the hearing, and make its decision by open ballot. Once deliberation begins by the city council on the issue before it, no further evidence may be presented or arguments made either for or against the proposed rezoning or other amendments to this ordinance being considered.
(h)
Since one of the functions of the planning and zoning commission is to consider and plan for the long-range development of the city, the board of commissioners shall give great weight to the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission. However, such recommendations have advisory effect only and the board of commissioners shall not be bound by such recommendations. If the decision of the city council results in a rezoning of property or any other amendment to the comprehensive zoning ordinance, such amendment shall be adopted by ordinance.
(Ord. of 12-17-2002, § 23-20)
Sec. 70-3. - Zoning review standards.
In all zoning matters, both the planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners shall apply the following standards:

Whether the zoning proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property;
(2)
Whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property;
(3)
Whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned;
(4)
Whether the zoning proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools;
(5)
If the local government has an adopted land use plan, whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the land use plan; and
(6)
Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal.
(7)
What is the amount of undeveloped land or developed land, which could be used as zoned in the general area of the land being considered for rezoning, that could be utilized prior to any change in the current zoning.

Sec. 70-4. - Notice of public hearing.
(a)
Whenever the board of commissioners desires to take action resulting in a zoning decision it shall provide for a hearing on the proposed action. At least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing, the board of commissioners shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the City of Jesup a notice of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the hearing.
(b)
Notice of the proposed zoning change shall also be made by the city clerk by mailing notification by first-class mail to the person or firm to whom the property is assessed, and to all persons or firms to whom the property adjoining to the proposed zoning change is assessed on the city tax rolls. However, failure to mail such notice shall not invalidate the public hearing or rezoning process.
(c)
The notice shall state the general nature of the proposed amendment and shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property. Wherever a proposed amendment affects a particular property, a sign shall be placed in a conspicuous location on the property not less than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing on which a copy of the notice as it appears in the newspaper is attached.
(d)
For the purposes of this section, the existence of a street or alley between two pieces of property shall not prevent them from being considered as adjoining.

Thereafter, the regular initial appointments to the planning and zoning commission which first occur after the passage of this section (and including the mayor's regular initial appointment that will also be available at that time) shall be made so that the terms of said members shall be staggered. In order to establish staggered terms, the initial terms of two members shall be one year, and the initial terms of another two members will be two years, and the initial terms of another three members will be for three years. The members serving the one-year terms, the two-year terms, and the three-year terms shall be determined by agreement of the board of commissioners of the city and the mayor or by lot in the absence of such agreement. If at the end of any term of office of a member, a successor thereto shall not have been appointed, then the member whose term of office shall have expired shall continue to hold office until his or her successor shall be so appointed. Any vacancy in the planning and zoning commission shall be filled by appointment by the commissioner or mayor who made the original appointment to the planning and zoning commission that is then vacant. In the event of the vacancy of the commissioner or mayor who made such original appointment to the planning and zoning commission, any such vacancy in the planning and zoning commission shall be appointed by an affirmative majority vote of the remaining commissioners and the mayor. Members of the planning and zoning commission can serve successive terms without limit. The members of the planning and zoning commission shall receive no compensation for their services, and shall at all times maintain a current mailing address and telephone number on file with the city.

Charges for "removable for cause" may be made by any city commissioner, any member of the planning and zoning commission or by any citizen of the city. Any such charges must be made in writing, dated, signed and delivered to the board of commissioners of the city. A copy of any such charge must be mailed to the member of the planning and zoning commission against whom the charge is directed. Upon receipt of any such charge the board of commissioners of the city will then set a date and time for a public hearing. The city manager will notify both the party making the charge and the member of the planning and zoning commission against whom the charges are directed of the date, time and place of the public hearing. The member of the planning and zoning commission against whom charges are made shall have at least two weeks' notice prior to the date set for the public hearing to prepare for the public hearing. In the event, after the public hearing, the board of commissioners of the city, by majority vote, removes the member of the planning and zoning commission, the board of commissioners of the city will then proceed to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section.
