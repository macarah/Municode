3.7 - "DT" Downtown District.
Amended by Ordinance No. 2023-11
Purpose: Springfield seeks to regulate infill development and to preserve, promote and support the revitalization of its traditional city core. History demonstrates that a few traditional urban design conventions will generate building types and neighborhood forms which allow profitable, positive infill and change, which strengthen property values and appearance, and which offer a high quality of life. This District establishes new standards for land development in order to:

Create high-quality street spaces by using buildings to form an interesting and safe environment that works for pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists;
iii.
Enhance the viability of local businesses and reduce travel demand by focusing growth in appropriate locations accessible to pedestrians;
iv.
Provide a measure of predictability to property owners and occupants about what may be built on their land or that of their neighbors, yet allow for a market-driven mixture of land uses; and
v.
Promote and protect pedestrian activity and reduce the impacts of vehicle traffic traversing crosswalks and sidewalks at driveways.
3.7.1 General Location.

3.8 - "PUD" Planned Unit Development District.
The purpose of a PUD district is to provide that the public health, safety, and welfare be furthered in an area of increasing urbanization and growing demand for housing of all types and design: to ensure that the enacted zoning ordinance provisions encourage innovations in residential and non-residential development and redevelopment so that the growing demand for housing and commercial areas may be met by a greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so the economies secured may add to the benefit of those who need homes; and, in the aid of these purposes to provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and layout of residential and non-residential development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing and commercial activity existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within existing areas, and to ensure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development authorized here is carried out under such administrative standards and procedures as shall encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay.
It is the intent that a planned unit development be established by rezoning the applicable property to the PUD district and by simultaneously approving the preliminary development plan (with conditions and required modifications). Thereafter development will be guided by the provisions of the development plan (and attachments) for the specific project.
Uses permitted within a planned unit development:
i.
Residential uses, including single family, two-family, and multi-family dwellings.
ii.
Commercial uses of a type, size, and location designed to be compatible with the proposed residential development.
iii.
Other accessory of ancillary uses as are permitted in residential areas and conditional uses identified in standard zoning districts. Conditional uses may be specifically shown on the approved development plan or may later permitted through the conditional use permit approval process.
3.8.1 Applicability of the Planned Unit Development District.
3.8.1.1 The provisions of this section shall apply only to a tract of land which has a minimum of fifteen acres.
3.8.1.2 The Planning and Zoning Board and City Council in their review of the proposed development plan shall consider:
i.
The adequacy of existing and proposed streets, utilities, and other public services to serve the development.
ii.
The proper relation between the proposed development and surrounding uses, and the effect of the plan upon comprehensive planning for the surrounding area.
iii.
The character, design, and appropriateness of the proposed land uses and their adequacy to encourage desirable living conditions, to provide separation and screening between uses where desirable to preserve the natural amenities of streams, wooded areas and similar natural features.
iv.
The adequacy of open and play area and that recreation facility are provided for the needs of development.
3.8.1.3 Recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Board and approval by the City Council shall be accompanied by a report stating the reasons for approval of the application and specific evidence and facts showing that the proposed Planned Unit Development will not adversely affect the property adjacent to the area included in the plan.

iii.
Groups of buildings on the same parcel of land may be reviewed and permitted as a single project rather than individual buildings.
b.
Pre-Design submission. All projects shall be required to submit a conceptual and/or preliminary design. This preliminary submission will be reviewed by the Director and any other city staff deemed necessary. The developer will receive comments regarding the design submitted. The purpose of this submission is to offer guidance on ordinance interpretation of the conceptual site plan, landscape plan, and building design. Submitted drawings may vary but should however provide enough information to make determinations and provide feedback on the following:

The Director will provide a staff report to interpret compliance of the project to the overlay district standards, along with a summary of relevant notes from the pre-design submission. Additionally, the Director may seek to provide recommendations from licensed architects or landscape architects for larger scale projects.
The Approval of the site and design elements of a proposed project by the Review Board does not override any other specific requirements set forth in the remainder of the zoning ordinance. Any use related zoning actions, such as Rezonings, Annexations, Conditional Uses, Special Exemptions or Variances should be applied for separately though the Planning and Zoning Board and approved by City Council. As appropriate any zoning approvals necessary to approve the project shall take place prior to a project's review by the Review Board.

1)
Major Articulations: Generally refers to the breaking up of larger elevations into smaller masses.
2)
Minor Articulations: Generally refers to the way each of those masses is given a variety of detail.
ii.
Each new building with elevations over 50 lineal feet corner to corner shall be broken into smaller Major Articulations intended to convey the impression of separate buildings. Facades (over 100 feet) should be broken into at least thirds vertically with a maximum spacing between breaks in materials or massing occurring no less than every 50 feet horizontally or at each change in occupant (diagram A). Each unit within a single building containing multiple units (strip malls) should treat every business' facade (more than 50 feet from the adjacent business measured entry to entry) with a change in material, color and/or massing (diagram B). This variation can be achieved using color changes, material changes, slight projections in material, offsetting of the building envelope or changes in parapet height (diagram C). In general, any change in material or color should also include a change in the profile of the material or outlined with trim. Changes in material and color should not butt one another within the same vertical plane. Changes in perceived massing can be achieved through slight projections of veneers (three to four inches) or changes in parapet heights and are not required to include actual offsets in the footprint.
Diagram A:
Diagram B:
Diagram C:
iii.
Major Articulations shall occur at least every 50 feet of horizontal facade length or at changes between tenants, whichever is less as stated above. Minor articulations shall occur approximately every 30 feet of horizontal facade length and may be accomplished through the use of pilasters; the use of smaller offsets; or similar means intended to create the appearance of structural bays. Minor Articulations may include variation in shading devices, fenestration, canopies, control joints and/or material trim used to deconstruct the geometry and add variety to a design (diagram D).
Diagram D:
iv.
Building exteriors shall all have consistent architectural features, building materials, and rooflines. Elevations of all four sides of the building shall be part of the building permit application. Metal wall panels used as veneer on pre-engineered metal buildings should be limited to no more than 40 percent of any given facade on the front and both side elevations. The same material and color mix approved for the front elevation should be carried around both sides (diagram E). Requirements for both Major and Minor Articulations above will apply to the front elevation as well as to both side elevations.
Diagram E:
v.
Buildings at the corner of two public streets shall create corner focal points which anchor the corner. Focal points may include a chamfered corner, display windows, corner entrances, features such as fountains, or an outdoor gathering area with landscaping and furniture. Varying the height, adding canopies, additional glazing, projecting materials, changes in materials, etc. are additional ways to create a focal point and anchor the corner (diagram E).
vi.
Primary entrance, and individual tenant space entries, shall be designed to express greater architectural detail through the use of awnings, recessed/projected entries, changes in material, variations of the material patterning, or other similar techniques intended to create a focal point at the entry (diagram F).
Diagram F:
vii.
Colors. Earth tones (greens, tans, light browns, terracotta, etc.), grays, pale primary and secondary colors (less than 50 percent color value), white cream tones, and the like. Dramatic accents and/ or primary colors, may only be used for small areas such as trim, logos, or to distinguish an architectural feature. In no instance, shall the combination of dramatic accent color or primary colors compose more than ten percent of any building facade. It is highly recommended that material selections and/or colors are layered horizontally and detailed to present the appearance of a base, body and crown. Simple metal coping topping a parapet is not considered a design element and will not be considered a crown (diagram G).
Diagram G:
viii.
Corporate or logo architecture. Prototypical buildings that are designed for repetition to project a company or chain image may be rejected altogether. However, these designs may be acceptable if they conform to the above categories or adapt their features to fit the above categories.
ix.
Exterior materials and features prohibited.
1)
Plywood, cinderblock, unfinished poured concrete (architectural poured in place concrete or concrete veneer panels will be considered), un-faced concrete block, plastic and/or metal not closely resembling a natural material (smooth, pre-finished architectural metal panels, cement fiber panels and stucco panels will all be considered). No ribbed, standard metal wall panels will be accepted.
2)
No mansard roofs (other than as limited to focusing attention on primary entries or corners), low slope roofs without a parapet or unarticulated roofs having a length exceeding 50 feet without a change in parapet height.
3)

The use buffer plan shall show in detail the layout of the proposed development including the arrangement of buildings, structures, parking areas, permanent open spaces, and the location of proposed buildings and of existing or proposed buildings on adjacent properties. The plan shall also show the location of proposed buffers including a detailed description or sketch of such buffer materials to be used. Where trees or shrubs are required for a use buffer, the use buffer plan shall include a provision for an irrigated water source capable of watering vegetation within the use buffer.
C.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to uses or zoning districts where greater or more intensive buffer elements are required elsewhere by the Code of the City of Springfield, Georgia. Where a conflict exists, the most restrictive buffer and screening standard shall apply.
D.
Elements of the use buffer plan may be included in the landscape plan as a single submittal, provided that the landscape and buffer plan are drawn to the same scale.
E.
When more than one use exists within the same building and on the same property, the required buffer shall be determined by the use with the more restrictive buffer requirement as provided elsewhere in this section or the Code of the City of Springfield, Georgia.
4.7.3. Approval of Use Buffer Plan: City Staff shall approve or deny use buffer plans.
4.7.4. Use Buffers: The purpose of a use buffer is generally to provide screening that serves to either obscure the view of adjacent buildings or uses or to achieve a degree of opacity that prevents clear recognition of the use being buffered, and also to reduce the impact on adjacent properties of noise, air, water, dust, and heat pollution created by certain uses. Except as otherwise provided by this section, where a property abuts a street, a use buffer shall not be required along the side of the property that abuts the street. The width and opacity of the required use buffer increases with the degree of incompatibility between uses.
A.
Land Use Classes: There are seven classes of land uses for the purpose of determining the type of use buffer that is required. Within each Land Use Class are land use categories, specific land uses and zoning districts. The Land Use Class of vacant property shall be determined by its zoning district. Where a proposed use is not listed in any Land Use Class listed below, City Staff shall have discretion to determine the Land Use Class to which the proposed use belongs.

  4.7.5. Off-Street Parking Lot Buffer: The purpose of this buffer is to screen vehicular parking areas from adjacent properties and street rights-of-way.
A.
Applicability:
1.
An Off-Street Parking Lot Buffer shall be required where a parking lot containing four or more parking spaces adjoins other properties or where a parking lot abuts a public or private road right-of-way.
2.
An Off-Street Parking Lot Buffer shall not be required where a Use Buffer is required, or in areas designated for the display of vehicles for sales, rental, or leasing purposes.
EXPAND

  4.7.6 Additional Screening for Residential Developments:
A.
Developments of residential properties consisting of 5 housing lots (and/or units) or more are required to leave an undisturbed buffer with a width of no less than 20 feet against any adjacent properties.
1.
This provision shall apply to all developments containing single family homes, duplex developments, townhomes, or limited multifamily dwellings.
2.
This provision shall apply to all developments that involve the creation of 5 or more single family homes, duplex developments, townhomes, or limited multifamily dwellings that share a common lot, regardless of the individual residential units and/or structures being rented or owner-occupied.
3.
If the land to be developed has no existing vegetation, or that existing vegetation is determined by the Zoning Official to be insufficient to provide an adequate buffer, a Type C Buffer shall be required.
4.
The buffer provided by this provision shall be shown as a sperate parcel within the development and not to be included in the individual lots created or be used in the calculation of minimum setback requirements.
B.
Developments of Multifamily residential properties shall be required to leave an undisturbed vegetative buffer with a width of no less than 20 feet against all adjacent non-residential properties.
C.
When development of property for residential use occurs along an existing street, installation of a 15 feet street tree buffer shall be required along any side of the property abutting the street. Trees within this street tree buffer shall be planted at a rate of one per 35 feet on center using "soldier" spacing (one tree every 35 feet, on center, in a continuous row). Such trees shall be no less than two and one-half inches DBH at the time of installation. This required 15 feet buffer area shall not be used in the calculation of minimum setback requirements for individual lots.
4.7.7. Design Standards and Maintenance:
A.
General: The height of the fence, wall, tree, hedge row, or other vegetation within the buffer shall conform to the requirements of Section 4.51 Vision Clearance at Intersections.
B.
Maintenance: All parts of a buffer shall be maintained in a safe and visually attractive manner.
C.
Fences and walls:
1.
In general, fences and walls serve two purposes: (1) to achieve a degree of opacity that prevents clear recognition of the use being buffered; and (2) to minimize the level of auditory disturbance that the use being buffered may cause adjacent properties.
2.
The design of the fence or wall shall be of the same architectural style as the principal building or buildings on the lot.
3.
Except where otherwise allowed by these regulations or where a variance is requested and granted, any fence or wall shall be opaque so as to prevent the passage of light and debris, and shall be constructed of textured or split-faced block, brick, stone, stucco over concrete block, painted concrete block, finished concrete block, architectural tile, decay resistant wood, or similar opaque materials. Decay resistant wood includes wood that is naturally decay resistant (e.g. cedar, cypress, redwood) or wood that has been chemically and/or mechanically treated (e.g. chromate copper arsenate [CCA]) to a retention rate such that the manufacturer provides a guarantee against decay for 40 years.
4.
Unfinished concrete block shall not be permitted.
5.
The height of a fence or wall shall not exceed eight feet. Fences and walls shall be interrupted at intervals not exceeding 25 feet by architectural features such as pilasters or columns or by various species of plants that are at least as tall as the fence or wall or taller.
6.
The fence or wall shall be set back not less than five feet from the property line unless otherwise approved by City Staff.
7.
The height of a fence or wall shall be measured from the finished grade at the base of the fence or wall to the top of the fence or wall, but shall not include columns or posts.
D.
Vegetation: In general, the purpose of vegetation in a buffer is to achieve a degree of opacity that prevents clear recognition of the use being buffered. There shall be no encroachment of structures or paving within the area designated as a buffer.
1.
Plant location: All plant materials within buffers shall be installed to achieve the maximum level of opacity.
2.
Trees:
i.
Where trees are required as a part of a buffer plan, the developer's buffer plan shall indicate each species of tree that will be part of the buffer. Acceptable species of large and understory trees are listed in Tables 1 and 2. All trees and shrubs within the buffer shall be of the evergreen variety except where City Staff determines that a non-evergreen variety would better suit the buffer. City Staff shall have the discretion to prohibit any species of tree from being placed in a buffer, even if the species of tree to be prohibited is listed in Table 1 or 2.
ii.
As a buffer matures, it is anticipated that understory trees may not survive the shading by large trees. Where the buffer has achieved opacity, dead understory trees do not have to be replaced. However, in the above-described situation, dead understory trees shall be removed to maintain the buffer in a safe and visually attractive condition.
3.
Hedge rows: For newly established hedge rows, shrubs shall be a minimum of three feet in height in order to achieve 50 percent of the required buffer at plant maturity. Shrubs used in hedge rows shall be planted between 18 and 30 inches apart, measured from the base of the plant. Further, shrubs used in hedge rows shall be planted on center in a continuous row.
4.
Shrubs:
i.
Where shrubs are required as a part of a buffer plan, the developer's buffer plan shall indicate each species of shrub that will be part of the buffer. Acceptable shrub species are found in Table 3. City Staff shall have the discretion to prohibit any species of shrub from being placed in a buffer, even if the species of shrub to be prohibited is listed in Table 3.
5.
Preserved stands of vegetation within buffers: It shall be preferred to preserve mature stands of natural vegetation within buffers to the maximum extent possible. The acceptability of stands of mature natural vegetation within buffers shall be determined by City Staff.
4.7.8. General Variances: The City Council may approve variances from these requirements at the request of the property owner if all of the following findings are made:
A.
The variance would be in keeping with the overall character of the area;
B.
The variance would not be contrary to the purpose and intent of these regulations;
C.
The variance would not be detrimental to existing or proposed surrounding uses; and
D.
The variance would serve public purposes to a degree equal to or greater than the standards replaced.
4.7.9. Variances for Security Purposes: The City Council may approve variances where the Chief of Police determines that security would be compromised by construction of a buffer designed in strict conformance with the requirements of this section.
4.7.10. Exemptions:
A.
Properties located within the DT (Downtown) zoning district shall be exempt from all buffer requirements of this section other than those set forth in Section 4.7.5 (Off-Street Parking Lot Buffers). However, the Land Use Class of properties within the DT zoning district shall be used to determine the buffer requirements of properties adjacent to the DT zoning district.
4.7.11. Annexation: The Land Use Class of vacant land that the City annexes shall be assigned the Land Use Class that corresponds with its zoning district.
4.7.12. Appeals: Any decision made by City Staff under this section shall be appealable to the City Council.
4.7.13. Severability: If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this section is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of this section.

4.45 - Signs.
4.45.1 Purpose and findings. The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are as follows:

To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts;
(e)

(f)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city;
(g)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for advertisement by the business community located within the city so as to promote the economic vitality of local businesses;
(h)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the state constitution and the United States Constitution within the city;
(i)
To establish an approval system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts;
(j)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for approval or permits;
(k)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
(l)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs; and
(m)
To provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

5.4 - Conditional Uses.
5.4.1 Applicability. Certain uses or development situations are identified in the ordinance as "conditional uses." These uses or development situations may be permitted in the zoning district(s) indicated, but may involve consideration of special circumstances or factors to determine that they are appropriate to the specific location and property. These uses may also require additional conditions to be imposed to ensure compatibility with the surrounding area and consistency with the overall objectives of this ordinance.
5.4.1.1 Procedures for Review of Conditional Uses.
i.
A request for approval of a conditional use shall be filed with the Building and Zoning Official. The request shall be accompanied by a development plan for the project, unless it is obvious that the nature of the request and the issues involved are not appropriate for development plan review.
ii.
The Planning and Zoning Board shall review the request for approval of a conditional use and forward its recommendation to the City Council.
iii.
In considering a request for a conditional use, the Planning and Zoning Board and the City Council shall evaluate the criteria as they relate to specific use requested and the specific location of the proposed conditional use.
iv.
If the City Council determines that the conditional uses reasonably meets the criteria, or can be conditioned to meet the criteria, it will approve the request. If the request is denied, the reasons therefore will be provided as part of the action denying the request.
v.
Following an action approving the request for conditional uses, or approving with conditions, the Building and Zoning Official will review and approve a development permit in the same manner as for any other development.
5.4.1.2 Criteria for Conditional Uses. All applications for conditional uses shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the following criteria:
i.
The proposal shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.
ii.
The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed use shall not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare.
iii.
The proposed use shall not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding properties for use permitted in the district and shall be consistent with the character of the immediate neighborhood.
iv.
Adequate measures shall be taken for ingress, egress and parking in a manner consistent with traffic operations and safety.
v.
The proposal design shall not have a substantial adverse effect on any known archaeological, historical, or cultural resource located on or off the site.
vi.
The proposed design shall minimize adverse effects on the use of adjacent property, including visual impacts.
vii.
Adequate provisions shall be made for buffers, landscaping, public open space, and other improvements necessitated by the proposal.
viii.
The use shall meet the lot and building requirements of the district in which it is located unless the requirements are specifically modified by the City Council. A conditional use shall meet any specific requirements identified in this ordinance and no variance shall be granted from these requirements.
ix.
The use shall comply at all times with the approved development plan, and any conditions imposed for establishment and operation of the use.

Hours of operation of the use.
ii.
Restraints to minimize environmental effects such as noise, vibration, air pollution, glare, and odor.
iii.
Special yard or other open space, lot area, or dimension requirements.
iv.
Height, size, or location limitations on buildings or other structures.
v.
Increase of the required amount of street dedication, roadway width, or improvements within the street right-of-way.
vi.
Regulation of the size, location, screening, drainage, surfacing, or other improvements of a parking or truck loading area, and control of traffic generation or circulation.
vii.
Regulation of the number, size, location, height, or lighting of signs.
viii.
Regulation of the location, intensity, and shielding of outdoor lighting.
ix.
Berming, screening, landscaping, or other measures to protect adjacent or nearby property, including standards of installation and maintenance.
x.
Regulation of the size, height, location, or materials for a fence or wall.
xi.
Regulations to protect existing trees, vegetation, water resources, wildlife habitat, or other significant natural resources.
xii.
Consideration of the size, style, history, and appearance of a structure to insure architectural compatibility with other structures in the district.
5.4.1.4 Previously Approved Conditional Uses; Expiration.
i.
It is the intent of this ordinance that any use or situation approved as a conditional use prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall continue to be valid unless the use or situation is abandoned or a change is requested. Any change shall be processes as a new request for a conditional use under the provisions of this ordinance.
ii.
The use or activity permitted under a conditional use shall be commence within one year after approval or the conditional uses shall expire, unless a different term is provided as part of the approval of the conditional uses.
5.5 - Variances.
Applicability: Certain cases which request variances from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance or resolution will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance or resolution shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done and make a recommendation to the City Council. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the City Council that:
5.5.1 There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography;
5.5.2 The application of the ordinance or resolution to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
5.5.3 Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
5.5.4 Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of the ordinance or resolution, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by the ordinance.
5.5.5 The fact that a property owner will suffer financial hardship if not granted a special exception or a variance from the zoning ordinance, is of itself insufficient ground for granting a variance.
In exercising the above powers, the City Council may, in conformity with the provisions of the ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
5.5.6 Court Review. Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of the City Council may take an appeal to the Superior Court. Said appeal to the Superior Court shall be the same as an appeal to the Superior Court form any decision made by the Judge of the Probate Court as specified in Chapter 6-2 of the Code of Georgia, except, however, that said appeal may be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision of the City Council, and upon failure to file said appeal within 30 days, the said decision of City Council shall be final. Provided, however, that on appeal said case shall be heard by the Judge of the Superior Court without a jury unless one of the parties files a written demand for a jury trial within 30 days form the filing of the appeal.
5.6 - Rezoning.
In exercising its zoning powers, the mayor and council shall balance the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, and general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property. The Mayor and Council thus shall consider the following factors prior to exercising the zoning power:
5.6.1 Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area?
5.6.2 Is this proposed zoning generally related to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area?
5.6.3 Whether the zoning decision will result in a use, which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools
5.6.4 Will this request place irreversible limitations or cause material detriment on the area similarly zoned as it is or on future plans for it?
5.6.5 Is there an imminent need for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested?
5.6.6 Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood?
5.7 - Conditional Use Permit for Uses Not Defined.
5.7.1 Where a use is not listed as either a permitted use or a conditional use in this ordinance, it may be permitted as a conditional use pursuant to the procedures and criteria in Section 5.4, subject to the following:
5.7.1.1 The use shall be similar in character to other uses permitted in the district either by right or by conditional use permit. In considering the similarity in character, consideration shall be given to noise, odors, smoke, dust, traffic impacts, demand on public facilities and utilities, and other potential impacts.
5.7.1.2 The use shall not be prohibited use in any district.
5.8 - Special Exemptions.
Applicability. In certain instances special exceptions may be authorized by City Council subject to the following criteria and conditions:
5.8.1 A special exception shall be a reasonable modification of the restrictions and limitations in this ordinance and will not derogate from the intent of the zoning district within which the property is located or cause unreasonable injury to other properties.
5.8.2 A special exception will not permit a use not otherwise permitted in the district and will not violate the terms of City's adopted Comprehensive Plan.
5.8.3 In approving a special exception, the City Council may place reasonable conditions on the use or development of the property so as to mitigate any possible adverse impacts of the proposed development. Any violation of such conditions shall void the special exception.
