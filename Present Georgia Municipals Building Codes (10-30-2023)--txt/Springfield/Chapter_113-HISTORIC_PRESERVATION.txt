Types of decision.
a.
Approval. When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangements or uses having no effect on exterior architectural features.

Approval with conditions. If the commission identifies elements of a proposed material change in appearance which are not in compliance with the review criteria, the commission may make recommendations or set such conditions and/or changes which render the application for a certificate of appropriateness in compliance, thereby avoiding a substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district.

If the applicant fails to submit the requested information within said period, the application is to be considered withdrawn without prejudice. The applicant, if he so desires, may resubmit the application for the next regular meeting.
d.
Denial. When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall deny the application if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance is not in compliance with the review criteria and will have a substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and resubmit the application at any time after doing so.

The commission shall evaluate the application for any potential substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. The commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; general design, arrangement, texture and materials of the architectural features involved; and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. New construction shall conform in orientation, setback, scale, form, design, materials, landscaping and environmental features to the visual and historic character of the designated historic property or designated historic district specified in the commission's design guidelines, criteria and policy statements.

(3)
Demolition.
a.
Criteria. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, or objects, judged to be 50 years old or older, shall be guided by the following criteria:
1.
The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, or object;
2.
The importance of the building, structure, or object to the ambiance of a district;
3.
The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location;
4.
Whether the building, structure, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or city;
5.
Whether the building, structure, or object is of such old, unusual or uncommon design, craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be reproduced or could be reproduced only with great difficulty;
6.
Whether retention of the building, structure, or object would increase property values, promote business, create positions, attract tourists, students, writers, historian, artists and artisans, attract new residents, encourage study and interest in American, regional, or local history, stimulate interest and study in architecture, educate citizens in American culture and heritage or make the municipality a more attractive and desirable place to live;
7.
Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be;
8.
Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, or object from collapse or continued deterioration;
9.
Whether the building, structure, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value;

c.
Condition documented. Applications for demolition shall include current and archival photographs of the interior and exterior of the building and drawings to document the condition of the building.
d.
Notice.

Conspicuous notice shall be posted on the premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in a location clearly visible from the public right-of-way. The purpose of this section is to further the purposes of this section by preserving historic buildings which are important to the education, culture, traditions and economic values of the city, and to give the city's interested persons, historical societies, organizations, or any other entity the opportunity to acquire or arrange for the preservation of such buildings. The commission may at any time during such delay period approve a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, in which event a demolition permit shall be issued without further delay. Further, nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the city to demolish or allow demolition of any building or structure in the event of an emergency or in the interest of public safety or welfare.
(h)
Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making.

Any such appeal must be filed with the city council within 15 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to subsection (i)(1) of this section or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within 15 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for commission action, as provided by subsection (i)(2) of this section. Appeals for properties within the city shall be made to the city council. The city council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the city council finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the city council may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for city ordinance violations, namely via petition for writ of certiorari.

State Law reference— Certificates of appropriateness, O.C.G.A. § 44-10-27 et seq.
Sec. 113-7. - Maintenance of historic properties and building and zoning provisions.
(a)
Ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness.
(b)
Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of individual properties within a designated historic district or of designated historic properties shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair through deliberate or inadvertent neglect. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect:
(1)
The commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings and structures in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and exterior openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, or the deterioration of a building's structural system, shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair.
(2)
In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission shall notify the property owner and any other person who may have legal custody and control thereof in writing, via certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the most recent address of the owner on record with the tax authorities of the county, and set forth in reasonable particularity the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. Such notification shall also inform the recipient of the right to appeal set forth herein.
(3)
In the event the situation is not remedied in 60 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in this chapter, or at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The property owner shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance or repair. The cost of such maintenance or repair shall be a lien against the real property. The lien shall attach to the real property at the time of payment of all costs of maintenance or repair by the city.
(4)
Any such notification sent by the commission under this section may be appealed to the city council within 15 days of receipt. The city council shall rescind such a notification only if it finds that the commission had no substantial justification for requiring action to be taken, or that the measures required were not reasonable under all of the circumstances. The taking of an appeal to the city council shall not operate to suspend any notification requiring buildings or structures to be secured or requiring temporary support, unless the city council expressly suspends such notification. The city council shall seek preliminary and permanent relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any such notification.
(5)
Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
(c)
Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be constructed so as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city building and zoning codes, nor prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.
