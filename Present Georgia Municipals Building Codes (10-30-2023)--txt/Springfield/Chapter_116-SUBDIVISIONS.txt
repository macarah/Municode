DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 116-39. - Schedule of filing fees.
Fees shall be paid in connection with the applications for preliminary plat approval and final plat approval. Fees are as stated in the fee schedule and are calculated based on the number of lots created by the subdivision.
(Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019)
Secs. 116-40—116-66. - Reserved.
DIVISION 2. - APPROVAL PROCEDURES

Sec. 116-67. - Steps.
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of five separate steps. These are:
(1)
Pre-design plan review.
(2)
Engineering and design review.
(3)
Review and approval of the preliminary plat.
(4)
Site prep and construction of infrastructure.
(5)
Review and approval of the final plat.
Step (1), (2) and (3) shall be completed prior to making any street improvements, installing any utilities. Step (4) and (5) shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The provisions of this division shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats.
(Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019)
Sec. 116-68. - Pre-design plan review procedures.
Prior to the submission of engineering and design documents, the developer shall submit to the Building and Zoning Department a plan of the proposed subdivision. Included with the sketch plan should be a map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The developer should submit plans for to property to be subdivide, including proposed zoning changes (if any), lots dimensions and street locations. The purpose of the plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat, and to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The Building and Zoning Official shall consult with the public works department to review the plans and will approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the plan review submission in writing.
(Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019)
Sec. 116-69. - Engineering and design review.
(a)
After approval of the plan review submission, the developer shall begin design of the subdivision development as indicated in the plan review and submit for approval the engineering and design files to the Building and Zoning Department. The submission shall be submitted in print (two copies) and digital format and will be reviewed for compliance with development design standards and zoning regulations as well as the adequacy of the water, sewer and road infrastructure. After review, comments will be submitted to the developer in writing within 20 days of the original submission. Each additional revision will be reviewed, and comments returned in the same manner.
(b)
Once approved the Building and Zoning Department shall issue a final approval letter and the preliminary plat can be submitted to city council. Failure to submit a preliminary plat within six months of the engineering and design final approval letter will void the approval and the approval must be applied for again.
(Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019)
Sec. 116-70. - Preliminary plat procedures.
(a)
Once the engineer and design files have been approved, the developer will have six months to present to city council the preliminary subdivision plat. Preliminary plat review fees are due at the time of submission. The preliminary plat will show the intended subdivision of the property and should be submitted in the same manner and format as the final plat. The purpose of the preliminary plat submission is for the developer to have formal approval of the lots to be subdivided and the roads to be constructed before beginning construction. Preliminary plat approval is not an effectual subdivision property or dedication of streets.
(b)
Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the city council at least 15 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the city council. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in print and digital format and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. Any preliminary plat submitted to the city council shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or his designee) to whom the notice of hearing may be sent; and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the city council without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent by registered or certified mail to said address not less than five days before the date fixed therefore. Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested.
(c)
The city council shall act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after submission and, if approved, shall indicate in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express in writing its disapproval and its reasons therefor. Failure of the city council to act within 60 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the city council on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the council shall be recorded in the minutes of the council meeting.
(d)
Approval of the preliminary plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the secretary of the city council on authorization by the city council. Also noted shall be the date on which the city council granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or his authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 12 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of the preliminary plat to the city council for approval. Any additional requirements placed upon the plat that were not placed upon the plat when it was first submitted shall be necessary for inclusion in the final plat. All appropriate fees shall be payable upon resubmission of the plat.
(e)
Approval of the preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final, or record, plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the city council, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
(Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019)
Sec. 116-71. - Final plat procedures.
(a)
Minor subdivisions.
(1)
For minor subdivisions, the final plat may be approved by the zoning administrator following review and approval from all necessary departments. Upon review of a plat that complies with all the requirements of the minor subdivision regulations, including but not limited to zoning district, lot size, access, frontage requirements, and lot requirements as stated in section 116-176, the final plat may be signed by the zoning administrator and mayor.
(2)
At least two prints shall then be made from the original, one to be kept on file with the city, and one to accompany the original which shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of court. Approval of the final plat by the city council shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the city of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat.
(b)

After the adoption of a major street plan as provided by law, the city or other public authority shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections, or other facilities or utilities in any street which has been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of, a public street prior to the attachment of the city council's subdivision jurisdiction, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on the subdivision plat approved by the city council. The city council may locate and construct or may accept any other street if the ordinance submitted to the city council for its approval is passed by not less than three-fourths of the entire membership of the city council. A street approved by the council shall have the status of an approved street as though it had originally been shown on a plat approved by the city council or on a plat made and adopted by the city council.

Sec. 116-173. - Streets.
(a)
Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans and maps with existing amended plans of the city council. A traffic safety study shall be completed before approval of all exit streets.
(b)
Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended.
(c)
Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be provided.
(d)
Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking, or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the city council.
(e)
Minor street. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
(f)
Trees. It is recommended that as many trees as possible remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and that all trees having a trunk diameter of six inches or more, measured four feet above the ground, shall remain unless they lie within the necessary paved areas surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure.
(g)
Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad right-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining land shall be treated as follows:
(1)
In residential districts a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be paved adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited."
(2)
In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
(3)
All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(h)
Reserved strips prohibited. Reserved strips at the terminus of a new street shall be prohibited.
(i)
Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 200 feet shall be prohibited.
(j)
Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable.
(k)
Cul-de-sac. A minor street not to extend more than 800 feet in length and provide a turnaround having a roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a 30-foot radius.
(l)
Alleys. Service alleys or drives may be required in multiple dwellings and commercial and industrial developments and shall have a minimum surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the city council of the need for alleys.
(m)
Street right-of-way widths. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows:
(1)
Curb and gutter. See Exhibit E for illustration.
EXPAND
Local street Pavement Width Right-of-Way
2 lane with parking 40' 60'
Collector street
2 lane with left turn lane 40' 60'
2 lane with left turn and service lane 56' 80'
4 lane 54' 80'
4 lane with service lane 78' 90'
Arterial street
4 lane 56' 80'
4 lane with service lane 74' 100'
4 lane with left turn lane 68' 90'
3 lane with left turn lane and service lane 86' 110'
  (2)
Shoulder. See Exhibit E for illustration.
EXPAND
Local Pavement Shoulder Ditch Right-of-Way
6' 22' 6' 16' 60'
Collector or arterial
2 lane 24' 10' 18' 80'
4 lane 48' 10' 18' 104'
4 lane with left turn lane 62' 10' 18' 118'
  Notes:
(1) Except for local streets, pavement widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes are intended only for the loading and unloading of passengers and goods and for disabled vehicles and are not for the storage of vehicles.
(2) Right-of-way (henceforth referred to as R/W) width listed is for only that portion of the typical section between the limits indicated in the diagram. Sloping rights of additional R/W will be required for cut and fill slopes outside these limits; these future slope areas beyond indicated R/W limits should also be kept clear of development until slopes have been constructed.
(3) R/W widths greater than the minimum are encouraged because they make for a safer, more aesthetic and more comfortable facility and permit future roadway widening without disrupting abutting property.
(4) All sidewalks shall be 48 inches wide and installed by builders after completion of construction.
(5) Individual homeowners shall be responsible for the maintenance of area/grass between streets and sidewalk adjoining their property.
(6) Landscaping and maintenance of entrances to subdivisions shall be done by the developer or homeowners' associations.
(n)
Sight distance for vertical curves. Where vertical curves are used, the minimum sight distance shall be as follows:
EXPAND
Design Speed (MPH) Minimum Curve Radii (feet) Minimum Stopping Sight Distance (feet)
Local 30 275 200
Collector 35 350 240
Arterial 40 500 275.1
  (o)
Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees occurs in the alignment of a marginal access of a minor street or road, a curve of reasonable radius shall be introduced. A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, industrial, or commercial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares the centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or the city or county engineer. On collector, industrial or commercial service streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 350 feet. On minor streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical.
(p)
Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares shall be established by the state department of transportation or county engineers. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions make this impractical. Grades on minor residential streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All streets shall have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent.
