If the community development director determines the requested comprehensive plan amendment will require a review and approval by the department of community affairs, the community development director shall initiate the required amendment process pursuant to State law. All time limits identified in this UDO for review by the county shall be tolled until the department of community affairs has completed their review.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-304. - Criteria.
In determining whether the proposed amendment should be approved, the P&Z commission and board of commissioners shall consider if the change is needed to address:
(a)
Appropriateness: Amending the comprehensive plan is the appropriate mechanism to address the matter presented and the proposed amendment does not raise policy or land use issues that would be more appropriately addressed in another manner, e.g., during the county's five or ten-year update, through the implementation schedule of the CIP, etc.
(b)
Original errors or omissions: Whether there was error or omission in the adoption of the comprehensive plan, or in the supporting premises and findings.
(c)
Subsequent events: Whether events subsequent to the comprehensive plan adoption have invalidated portions of the plan, changed the character of the county, or demonstrated new information.
(d)
Need for amendment: The need for processing the amendment prior to a routine comprehensive plan update.

( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-311. - Completeness review.
The community development director shall review the application and shall determine if the application is complete pursuant to the provisions of section 114-213. Upon finding that the application is complete, the community development director shall consult with the DRC, prepare a report making findings and recommendations on the application, and authorize notice to be provided in accordance with section 114-218 and the following section 114-312.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-312. - Notice.
For text or zoning map amendments, the community development director shall provide notice as identified in section 114-218. Notice shall not be required in the case of a comprehensive revision and re-adoption of the entire zoning map unless the revision involves the rezoning of parcels of land to less intense uses or 'down zoning', in which case notification to owners of those parcels shall also be made by first class mail.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-313. - Criteria for zoning map amendments.
In its review of an application for a zoning map amendment, staff and hearing bodies shall consider the following criteria. No single factor is controlling except for paragraph (a). If the request is not consistent with the comprehensive plan, the application shall be denied unless the applicant submits an application for comprehensive plan amendment and such request is approved. For all other criteria, each criterion must be weighed in relation to the other criteria. The hearing body shall not consider any representations made by the applicant that, if the change is granted, the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the hearing body shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification.
(a)
Consistency. Whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and helps carry out the purposes of this UDO;
(b)
Compatibility with neighboring lands. Whether the proposed reclassification is compatible with or would negatively impact the overall character or land use pattern on an abutting property or neighborhood near the subject property;
(c)
Adequacy of public facilities and services. Whether public facilities and services, including, but not limited to, roads, parks and recreational facilities, police and fire protection, schools, stormwater drainage systems, water supplies, wastewater treatment, and solid waste services, are adequate to serve projected demands from development allowed by the amendment;
(d)
Adverse impacts. Whether the proposed reclassification will adversely affect known archaeological, historical, cultural or environmental resources; negatively impact water or air quality; negatively impact ground water recharge areas or drainage patterns; or increase soil erosion or flooding;
(e)
Suitability as presently zoned. Whether the property is suitable for authorized uses as presently zoned;
(f)
Net benefits. Whether the relative gain to the public exceeds the hardships imposed upon applicant by the existing zoning restrictions;
(g)
Development plans. Whether the applicant has plans for development of the property. Applications for multifamily or non-residential zoning classifications carry a rebuttable presumption that such rezoning shall adversely affect the zoning scheme unless a concept plan is submitted with the application;
(h)
Market demand. Whether there is projected demand for the property as currently zoned, which may be determined by the length of time the property has failed to produce income or be used productively as zoned, or whether there are substantial reasons why the lot cannot be used in accordance with the existing zoning classification; and
(i)
Health, safety, and welfare. Whether the proposed map amendment bears a substantial relationship to the public health, safety or general welfare.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-314. - P&Z commission action on map and text amendments.
The P&Z commission shall hold a public hearing on a proposed map or text amendment and shall render its recommendation in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter after considering the criteria in section 114-313. In making its recommendation on a map amendment, the P&Z commission may recommend approval, approval with conditions, or denial. In making a recommendation on a text amendment, the P&Z commission may recommend approval as presented, recommend modifications to the text, or recommend denial. If the P&Z commission recommends denial of the text amendment, the Commission shall provide reasons for the recommendation.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-315. - Board of commissioners action on map amendments.
(a)
The board of commissioners shall conduct a public hearing on the application after receiving the P&Z commission's recommendation. The board of commissioners is not bound by any recommendations of the P&Z commission. If the P&Z commission has not made a recommendation in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter, the board of commissioners may proceed with the required readings and render a decision on the amendment.
(b)
The board of commissioners is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on applications for amendments.
(c)
At the conclusion of the public hearing, the board of commissioners may proceed to vote on the proposed amendment, refer it to a committee for further study or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure.
(d)
After considering the criteria in section 114-313, the board of commissioners may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. If the application is denied, the board of commissioners shall advise the applicant of the reason for denial. The board of commissioners shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large.
(e)
If conditions are attached to the approval, the conditions should relate to the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property, proposed support facilities such as parking areas and driveways, pedestrian and vehicular circulations systems, screening and buffer areas, the timing of development, street and right-of-way improvements, water and sewer improvements, storm water drainage, the provisions of open space and other matters that the board of commissioners finds appropriate or that the applicant may propose. Such conditions to approval of the application may include dedication to the County of any rights-of-way or easements for streets, water, sewer or other public utilities necessary to serve the proposed development.
(f)
Any conditions attached to the approval are binding on the property. The conditions will be part of the zoning map amendment ordinance and a violation of the conditions, unless amended or removed, shall be considered a violation of the county ordinances and subject to all the remedies provided for under State law and this UDO. If an applicant seeks to amend a condition, the same process as the zoning map amendment must be followed.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-316. - Board of commissioners action on text amendments.
After deliberating the merits of a proposed UDO text amendment and considering the public health, safety, and welfare, the board of commissioners may approve, approve with amendments or reject a proposed text amendment.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-317. - Effect of approval.
Approval of a map amendment entitles the property owner to use the property in accordance with the standards of the applicable zoning district. The approval of an amendment to the UDO text or zoning map does not authorize the use, occupancy, or development of property until the applicant receives necessary development approvals, such as subdivision, site plan and building permit approval.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-318. - Recording procedures.
When the amendment involves changes to the existing zoning district boundaries, the form of the amending ordinance shall contain a narrative description of the land to be reclassified or reference to an accompanying plat of such land showing the new zoning classifications and indicating the boundaries. The community development director shall refer to the attested ordinance as a record of the current zoning status until such time as the zoning map can be changed.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-319. - Effect of denial of application.
A application for the amendment to the zoning map that has been denied in whole or in part, or approved to a classification other than the classification originally requested, shall not be resubmitted within one year of the date of the board of commissioners action on the original application. However, nothing in this division shall preclude the seeking of a different classification.

DIVISION 3. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT

Sec. 114-321. - Purpose.
The purpose of this division is to establish procedures and review criteria for the establishment of planned development districts (PD) that comply with the purposes and standards established in article V, division 7. No building permits shall be issued prior to final development plan approval for the applicable portion of a PD district, except for single-family detached dwelling units on a single parcel.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-322. - Approval process overview.
The general approval process for the creation of a PD district involves a zoning map amendment which typically occurs in coordination with the subdivision of land. The approval process is two-phased with the applicant required to obtain conceptual plan approval and then obtain final development approval. The process summarized in Exhibit 322 identifies the steps involved in a typical PD district creation. Actual process may vary based on the complexity of the proposed development.

DIVISION 4. - CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

Sec. 114-327. - Purpose.
This division establishes a process and standards to approve certain uses that, because of unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent land uses, are not permitted in zoning districts as a matter of right. These uses may be permitted through the issuance of a conditional use permit (CUP) after ensuring that the use complies with the CUP approval criteria. No inherent right exists to receive a CUP. Such authorization must be approved under a specific set of circumstances and conditions. Each application and situation is unique and may be subject to specific requirements to mitigate the impacts of the proposed use.

Sec. 114-337. - CUP amendments.
(a)
An amendment or modification is a request for any enlargement, expansion, increase in intensity, relocation, or modification of any condition of a previously approved and currently valid CUP.
(b)
Amendments to an approved CUP approval may be considered minor or major amendments. The community development director shall review a request for a modification and shall determine whether the request for amending an approved CUP is minor or major. In addition to a CUP application, a developer requesting approval of modifications shall also submit a written request, and plans or drawings as necessary, identifying and detailing the requested changes. Approval or denial of a request and any changes shall be provided to the applicant in writing.
(1)
Minor amendments from a CUP issued by the board of commissioners may be granted by the community development director. For purposes of this section, minor modifications or changes are those that have no substantial impact on neighboring properties, the general public or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development. Such permission may be obtained without a public hearing or payment of any additional fee; however, a formal application for the requested modification to the CUP and/or applicable revised site plans, studies, or sketch plats, shall be filed with the community development director.
(2)
Major amendments are any proposed amendment other than those defined above as minor CUP amendments and shall be approved in the same manner and under the same procedures as the original approval. During the process for a major amendment, new conditions may be imposed only on the specific site or area requested to be modified. The applicant, however, retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing the request for an amendment and proceeding in accordance with the previously issued permit. Major amendments shall include, but are not limited to the following:
a.
Designation of additional land uses;
b.
Change in the location of use(s) from what is shown on the approved site plan or sketch plat, to another location on the same parcel;
c.
An increase or decrease in project area other than surveyor technical corrections. For a decrease in project area, the amendment will only be considered major if the decrease results in an increase in density or intensity as calculated by total square footage or total number of units within the project area;
d.
Change in dimensional standards set forth in the development conditions created in the CUP approval that result in a decrease in minimum standards (e.g., reduction in minimum setbacks or reductions in street widths) or increase in maximum standards (e.g. an increase in building height and/or gross density or intensity of land uses);
e.
Change to proposed treatment of buffering, landscaping, land uses or lot sizes along the perimeter of the development;
f.
Addition or reduction of driveways or access points, especially those which negatively affect connectivity or street safety; or
g.
Other modifications to the approved CUP that the community development director determines to be major.
(c)
Amendments shall have no detrimental impact on any adjacent property caused by significant change in the appearance or use of the property or any other contributing factor.
(d)
An amendment shall only be approved if the proposal conforms to the UDO and is in keeping with the spirit and intent of any adopted comprehensive plan and nothing in the currently valid conditional use permit precludes or otherwise limits such amendment.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCES

Sec. 114-339. - Purpose.
The board of adjustment shall have the power to vary the provisions of this UDO when the applicant demonstrates that the standards impose a substantial and unique hardship on the use of a property. Variances are intended to be used for quantifiable and not qualitative standards. The following may not be varied:
(a)
Permitted uses, i.e., allowing a use not permitted in a zoning district;
(b)
Minimum lot size (total square footage/acreage);
(c)
Maximum density;
(d)
Maximum number of parcels that may be served by a private easement;
(e)
Maximum number of parcels that may be created as a minor subdivision;
(f)
Minimum time between further subdivision of parcels within a minor subdivision; and
(g)
Development standards established for a PD unless the request is for an individual lot.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-340. - Application.
The variance application shall be filed with the community development director and shall comply with the requirements established in Appendix D.

( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-342. - Review criteria.
A variance may be granted by the board of adjustment if it finds that all the following conditions have been shown.
(a)
Unnecessary hardship would result from the strict application of this UDO. It shall not be necessary to demonstrate that, in the absence of the variance, no reasonable use can be made of the property.
(b)
The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property, such as location, size, or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as hardships resulting from conditions that are common to the neighborhood or the general public, may not be the basis for granting a variance.
(c)
The hardship did not result from actions taken by the applicant or the property owner. The act of purchasing property with knowledge that circumstances exist that may justify the granting of a variance shall not be regarded as a self-created hardship.
(d)
The requested variance is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of this UDO, such that public safety is secured, and substantial justice is achieved.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)

(b)
Before granting a variance, the board of adjustment must affirm by a simple majority that each of the required findings set forth as criteria section 114-342 is true. In so far as practicable, a motion to make an affirmative finding on each of the requirements shall include a statement of the specific reasons or findings of fact supporting each criterion.
(c)
In granting variances, the board of adjustment may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties.
(d)
If a variance request is denied, an applicant may not submit the same or similar variance request for the subject parcel within a year of the date of denial.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-344. - Effect of approval.
(a)
Except when the board of adjustment specifies that the variance shall be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration, the variance shall expire one year after the approval unless the applicant establishes the building, structure or other condition for which the variance was sought. The applicant may request a one-time extension of up to one year to establish the building, structure, or other condition. The community development director shall have the authority to approve or deny the request upon finding a reasonable reason for the delay. The applicant may appeal a denial by the community development director to the board of adjustment pursuant to article III, division 6.
(b)
The nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the development permit or the development permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this chapter.

DIVISION 7. - ABANDONMENT OF RIGHT-OF-WAY OR EASEMENT

Sec. 114-357. - Purpose and applicability.
This division identifies the process for approving the abandonment of right-of-way or easement, in whole or in part, when such property no longer serves a public purpose.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-358. - Initiation.
The process may be initiated by the board of commissioners or the owner of property abutting the right-of-way or easement or the entity owning the rights to the right-of-way or easement. If abandonment is not initiated by the county, the requestor must submit an application to the engineering director. The engineering director shall seek input from applicable county department heads, staff, and other interested parties and prepare a report with their recommendation to the board of commissioners. In preparing their recommendation, the engineering director may request additional information from the requestor such as a title report, boundary survey, or new subdivision plat. Costs to prepare such documents shall be borne by the requestor. The board of commissioners, upon receipt of the recommendation, shall either adopt a resolution declaring its intent to abandon right-of-way or easement and call for a public hearing or deny the request for abandonment.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-359. - Notice.
The engineering director shall cause the notice to be published once a week for two successive weeks prior to the hearing.

The cost of notice shall be borne by the applicant for the abandonment.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-360. - Decision.
At the hearing, any person may be heard on the question of whether or not the abandonment would be detrimental to the public interest, or the property rights of any individual. If the board of commissioners determines after the hearing that abandoning the right-of-way or easement is not contrary to the public interest, and that no individual owning property in the vicinity of the right-of-way or easement or in the subdivision in which it is located would thereby be deprived of reasonable means of ingress and egress to their property, the commission may adopt an order abandoning the right-of-way or easement. A certified copy of the order shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the court - real estate division.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-361. - Ownership.
(a)
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, upon the abandoning of the right-of-way in accordance with this section, all right, title, and interest in the right-of-way shall be conclusively presumed to be vested in those persons owning lots or parcels of land adjacent to the right-of-way, and the title of such adjoining landowners, for the width of the abutting land owned by them, shall extend to the centerline of the right-of-way.
(b)
The provisions of this subsection regarding division of right-of-way abandonment may be altered as to a particular right-of-way abandonment by the assent of all property owners taking title to an abandoned right-of-way by the filing of a plat which shows the right-of-way abandonment and the portion of the right-of-way to be taken by each such owner. The plat shall be signed by each property owner who, under this section, has an ownership right in the abandoned right-of-way.
(c)
The County may reserve its right, title, and interest in any utility improvement or easement within a right-of-way abandoned pursuant to this section. Such reservation shall be stated in the order of abandonment. Such reservation also extends to utility improvements or easements owned by private utilities which at the time of the right-of-way abandonment have a utility agreement or franchise with the county. To retain such easements, the board of commissioners shall, after the public hearing, approve a "declaration of retention of utility easements" specifically describing such easements.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-362. - Recording procedures.
Upon approval of the abandonment of the right-of-way or easement, the engineering director shall cause to be recorded all required documents with the clerk of court - real estate division and shall update all county records that such right-of-way or easement is no longer part of the county inventory.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)

Sec. 114-365. - Sketch plat.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The sketch plat serves as a guide to future density, intensity, land uses, pedestrian and bicycle ways, trails, parks and open space, as well as lot, road and drainage patterns. It is intended to ensure that a landowner investigates the broad effects that subdivision of property will have on the site itself as well as on adjacent properties and public infrastructure systems.
(2)
Approval of a sketch plat shall constitute acceptance of the land-use mix, development intensity, general road patterns, conceptual drainage patterns, lot patterns, parks and open space lands, and the general layout of pedestrian and bicycle trails, provided that these factors may be modified in conjunction with subsequent approvals if additional information reveals development constraints that are not evident during sketch plat review.
(3)
The sketch plat, together with the attendant items required herein, is to provide a basis for the construction of the subdivision and its improvements as well as a draft of the final plat of the subdivision. To achieve this, the applicant should consult with the community development director, engineering director and other agencies concerned with the subdivision and the improvements.
(b)
Applicability. Sketch plat approval is required prior to approval of construction plans, including clearing and grading permit and a final plat for any major subdivision. The provisions of this section do not apply to any major subdivision that has received approval of preliminary plat prior to the date of adoption of this UDO for which a final plat is recorded within 24 months of adoption of this UDO.
(c)
Initiation.
(1)
Process overview. The approval process and typical timing of sketch plat approval are summarized in Exhibits 365a and 365b. Actual timing may vary based on the date of submittal and scheduled hearing dates.

Sec. 114-366. - Construction plans.
modified
(a)
Purpose of construction plans. Construction plans ensure that public and private improvements associated with developments are consistent with the county's design standards and that improvements are documented in a way that facilitates the long-term management and enhancement of public infrastructure and ensures that improvements will be durable. Approved construction plans allow for the issuance of a road construction permit or site development permit. Any improvements in the county ROW following final plat approval shall require the submission of a road encroachment permit.
(b)
Applicability. Prior to review of a final plat or site plan for a non-residential development, the applicant shall have prepared, by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia, construction plans consisting of complete construction drawings and specifications of all rights-of-way, easements, roads, traffic control devices, streetlights, sanitary sewers, stormwater facilities, water system facilities, sidewalks, trails and other improvements required by federal, State, and local law. Landscape and tree protection plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect. The applicant may obtain a land disturbance permit per section 114-426 prior to obtaining construction plan approval or the applicant may submit the clearing and grading (land disturbance permit) with the construction plans. If a project requires sketch plat approval, a clearing and grading permit (land disturbance permit) may not be issued until the sketch plat or site plan have been approved.
(c)
Application for construction plan approval.
(1)
Submittals. Complete construction plan applications shall be submitted to the engineering director for review and approval. The application shall comply with the requirements established in Appendix D. In addition to review fees established pursuant to the fee schedule adopted by the board of commissioners, the engineering director may require payment deposit into an escrow account to cover the costs of plan review by the county's engineering consultant(s) in accordance with section 114-204 of this UDO.

a.
A certificate from applicant's engineer stating that the development of the subdivision will not increase, decrease or change the quality or quantity of surface or subsurface water reaching adjacent property shall be required. If such certificate cannot be delivered to the county, then an easement from or other agreement with the affected adjacent property owner shall be required.
b.
Each subdivision shall incorporate stormwater management facilities sufficient to maintain pre-development peak discharge rates across adjacent property lines.
c.
No subdivision shall be undertaken unless the applicant can establish to the engineering director that the flood potential within the subdivision, on adjacent or surrounding lands or wetlands will not be increased by the development of such subdivision. If such potential is in question, the engineering director shall make the final determination.
d.
Inter-basin transfer of water between river basins is prohibited.
(3)
Completeness review. The engineering director shall review the application and shall determine if the application is complete pursuant to section 114-213.
