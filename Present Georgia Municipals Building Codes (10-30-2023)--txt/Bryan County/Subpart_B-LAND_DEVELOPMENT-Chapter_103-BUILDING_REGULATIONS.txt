If a written request for an extension is not made in writing within 30 days after the expiration date, the permit becomes void. Every permit shall become void if the work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 12 months after its issuance, or if the authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a period of more than 12 months. Upon written request from the owner in cases where, due to unusual circumstances (economic hardship, lack of resources, personnel/family issues, etc.), the completion of a structure has been delayed beyond the two maximum permit periods, the building official may extend the building permit period beyond two years in order to complete the inspection(s) required to issue a certificate of occupancy.
(c)
Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations to supervise such work. In addition, the architect or engineer shall be responsible for complying with the permit, providing copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and, upon completion, making and filing with the building official a written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and the technical codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are approved by the building official.
(d)
Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "Reviewed for Code Compliance." The building official shall retain one set of drawings so reviewed and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative.
