(d)
The well shall be test pumped at not less than the desired yield for a period of at least 24 hours and shall continue for at least four hours after the pumping level has stabilized.
(e)
The methods of testing shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1)
Constant discharge method. This type of test is preferred for wells completed in unconsolidated aquifers. It is made by maintaining a constant rate of discharge equal to or greater than the desired yield of the well throughout the entire period of pumping. Measurements of pumping rate and water level shall be made every minute for the first ten minutes of the test, every two minutes for the next ten minutes, every five minutes for the next 40 minutes, every 15 minutes for the next hour, every 30 minutes for the next three hours, and hourly for the remainder of the pumping period. Recovery water-level measurements shall be made with the same frequency beginning with the cessation of pumping and continuing until complete recovery has occurred or until sufficient data have been collected to extrapolate full recovery.
(2)
Step drawdown method. This method is preferred for wells completed in consolidated rock formations. It involves the well being "step" tested at rates approximately one-half, one, and 1½ times the design capacity of the well. Each step should consist of equal periods of pumping except the final step may be continued for a longer period of time if desired by the owner. The pump is operated continuously for the entire period of the test. The discharge must be controlled with a gate valve if electric driven, or a gate valve and throttle if engine driven. The discharge is controlled and maintained at approximately the desired discharge for each step with an accuracy of + five percent. Pump discharge is measured with a meter such as a circular orifice meter that will permit instantaneous determination of the discharge rate. A half-inch I.D. or larger pipe is installed from a point about two feet above the pump intake to the well head. The top of the pipe is readily accessible to insert, remove and read the depth to water using either a steel tape or two-wire electric sonde. Measurements of pumping rate and water level are made for each step of the test according to the schedule given in the constant discharge method. Recovery water-level measurements are made with the same frequency until the well has fully recovered or until sufficient date have been recovered to extrapolate full recovery. The test pump shall be capable of pumping 150 percent of the desired yield of the well.
(f)
The pumping equipment shall be capable of operating continuously without interruption for the maximum period contemplated for the test.
(g)
Data shall be provided to the county health department.
(Code 1996, § 31-211; Ord. of 2-14-2006)
Sec. 12-115. - Well disinfection.
(a)
The well must be disinfected prior to the pumping test by the introduction of a chlorine solution into the well under sufficient pressure to overcome the natural flow pressures of all developed water-bearing zones, and in sufficient quantity to produce a minimum chlorine residual of 50 parts per million (mg/l) in six hours after such application.

DIVISION 3. - DESIGN CAPACITIES AND WATER DEMANDS

Sec. 12-148. - General.
An important factor in the planning and design of a water system is an accurate estimate of the quantities of water which must be supplied to meet water needs. These estimates are pivotal to the entire design, including the production of water, pumping, treatment, storage, and the distribution system. Each water system component is designed to meet certain flow requirements and to ensure that water will be available at the various water use points throughout the system in adequate quantities to meet demands.
(Code 1996, § 31-401; Ord. of 2-14-2006)
Sec. 12-149. - Estimating basic water demands.
(a)
The various components of a water system are designed to meet specific water flow criteria which are dependent upon the type of water system and the objectives of the system.
(b)
Average daily demand expresses the quantity of water used in a system in an average day. It is based upon experience from water meter readings in similar water systems over an extended period of time and reflects the normal seasonal and daily variations. For design purposes, it is usually determined by estimating the population or units of housing or other units and multiplying by an average per person or per unit water consumption derived from past experience. The average daily demand will be exceeded on many days (during peak demands), so it is not appropriate to design merely for the average. The greatest amount of water usage in one day or other period of time must be considered.
(c)
The following provides a guide for estimating the average daily demand for various types of establishments, in gallons per day per unit. The unit is persons per day unless otherwise indicated. The values are for normal water requirements and do not include special needs or unusual conditions. Additional allowances should be made for firefighting, lawn watering, swimming pool, industrial or commercial process water and other special uses.

    (d)
Maximum daily demand expresses the greatest amount of water a system will use in one day. Small residential water systems may experience that their maximum day is 1½ to two times the average day. However, this ratio may not apply to other types of water systems. In general, the smaller the water system, the greater the variation between the average and the maximum day.
(e)
Maximum hourly demand expresses the greatest amount of water which will be used in any hour during the day. This is sometimes referred to as the peak hour demand, although these will be short-term peak demand rates lasting for several minutes which will exceed the maximum hourly demand rate. Each type of system exhibits its own maximum hourly and short-term peak demands and the hours of peak occurrence will vary. For example, shopping centers usually experience hourly peaks in the early afternoon while residential communities may experience two peak hours, about 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The maximum hourly demand is often expressed as a ratio of the average daily demand, in gallons per minute. Generally speaking, the smaller the water system, the greater the maximum hour rate in respect to the average daily rate. The peak hourly demand at small residential communities may range about six to over ten times the average daily demand.
(f)
Peak demand (instantaneous demand) is the maximum amount of water necessary to meet the peak short-term demand rate which may occur several times during a day, usually occurring during the peak hour period. The instantaneous peak may last for several minutes. The rate is particularly important in considering the sizing of the storage tank in a hydro pneumatic system. The effective storage capacity is usually designed to meet these short-term peaks. The minimum effective storage volume of pressure tanks, in gallons, shall equal the peak demand, in gallons per minute (gpm), minus the pumping capacity (gpm), multiplied by 20. In the absence of sufficient effective storage to meet extended peak demands, the wells and pumps must be capable of meeting the peak demands. The smaller the water system, the greater the ratio of the peak demand to the average demand.

    Note: It should be noted that fire flow is not included in the definition of average daily and maximum daily demands and should be added if fire protection is desired. Fire flows are usually expressed as gallons per minute to fight a fire of a certain duration, and could be designed into a water system for firefighting purposes.
