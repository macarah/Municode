  Note: (1) RR-1 zoning applicable to lots of 1 acre or greater. R-15 zoning applicable to lots smaller than 1 acre. In determining the appropriate zoning district, however, the community development director shall determine the average lot size of R-30 parcels within a platted subdivision, lot size for single parcels outside of a major or minor subdivision, or review the conceptual plan included with a rezoning application for undeveloped tracts of land.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-502. - Conditional districts.
Upon the adoption of this UDO, the "Conditional District (CD)" designation shall no longer be permitted. For those parcels with a "Conditional District (CD)" designation prior to the adoption of this UDO, all conditions placed on the parcels shall remain valid and binding until such time as the board of commissioners, through the zoning map/text amendment process, modifies, amends, or removes the condition(s).
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-503. - Zoning map.
(a)
Establishment, amendment and maintenance of the official zoning map.
(1)
There shall be a map designated as the Official Zoning Map, which shall show the boundaries of all zoning districts within the county's planning jurisdiction. This map shall be stored on the county's geographic information system (GIS) and printed on durable material. Prints shall be dated and kept in the community development department.
(2)
The Official Zoning Map is adopted and incorporated herein by reference. Amendments to this map shall be made and posted in accordance with Article III, Division 2 of this UDO.
(3)
The community development director shall update the Official Zoning Map as soon as possible after amendments to it are adopted by the board of commissioners. Upon entering any such amendment on the map, the community development director shall change the date of the map to indicate its latest revision. The community development department shall keep copies of superseded prints of the zoning map for historical reference.
(4)
No unauthorized person may alter or modify the Official Zoning Map. If an unauthorized person alters or modifies the Official Zoning Map, the amendment shall be considered null and void, and the original zoning designation shall be reinstated.
(5)
GIS records shall indicate the zoning designation; the number and date of the ordinance creating the designation; and where a conditional zoning district was established prior to this UDO or conditions were included with the zoning map amendment approval, the conditions of that rezoning. GIS records shall maintain the zoning history.
(6)
Should the Official Zoning Map be lost, destroyed or damaged, the community development director may have a new map generated from the most reliable available data. No further board of commissioners authorization or action is required so long as no district boundaries are changed in this process.
(7)
If there is a question or dispute concerning the current zoning of a property, the community development director shall research the county's official records, including but not limited to application files, P&Z minutes, board of commissioners minutes, and county ordinances, to determine if the Official Zoning Map correctly identifies the parcel(s) zoning. The community development director shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of the parcel in the county.
(b)
Interpretation of zoning district boundaries.
(1)
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts shown on the Official Zoning Map or any other map incorporated in or referenced by the UDO, the following rules shall apply:
a.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, alleys or other public rights-of-way shall be construed to follow such centerlines. Where the street, alley or right-of-way has been vacated through official action of the governing body, the boundary shall be construed to follow the centerline of the vacated right-of-way.
b.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following property lines shall be construed to follow such lines.
c.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following jurisdictional boundaries shall be construed to follow such boundaries.
d.
Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks.
e.
Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline.
f.
Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of canals, streams or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
g.
Boundaries indicated as parallel to features described in paragraphs (a) through (f) above shall be construed as parallel to such features at the distance from the feature indicated on the Official Zoning Map. If a distance is not indicated on the Official Zoning Map, the distance shall be determined by the scale of the map unless actual dimensions are noted.
(2)
If, because of an error or omission on the Official Zoning Map, any lot within the jurisdiction of this UDO is not shown as being within a zoning district, such lot will be classified as A-5, until changed by amendment.
(3)
Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of any mapped area, the community development director shall make the necessary interpretation.
(c)
Parcels divided by district lines.
(1)
Whenever a single parcel of two acres or less in size is located within two or more different zoning districts, the district regulations applicable to the district within which the larger portion of the lot lies shall apply to the entire lot.
(2)
Whenever a single lot greater than two acres in size is located within two or more different zoning districts, then:
a.
If each portion of the lot located within a separate district is equal to or greater than the minimum lot size for that district, then each portion of the lot shall be subject to all regulations applicable to the district in which it is located.
b.
If any portion of the lot located within a separate district is smaller than the minimum lot size for that district, then such smaller portion shall be regarded as if it were in the same zoning district as the nearest larger portion to which it is attached.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-504. - Authorized use tables established.
Each district includes a table of authorized land uses showing the principal uses allowed by right within zoning districts, uses subject to supplemental conditions, and uses that must be authorized by conditional use permit. A master table showing all uses and districts is included in Appendix F.
(a)
By right uses. A "P" indicates the listed use is allowed by right within the respective zoning district subject to required approvals in accordance with the procedures established in Articles II—IV.
(b)
Uses subject to supplemental conditions. An "S" indicates that the listed use is allowed by right, but subject to supplemental use regulations established in the zoning district regulations, or articles VII and VIII.
(c)
Conditional uses. A "C" indicates the listed use is allowed within the respective zoning district only after review by the planning and zoning commission and approval of a conditional use permit by the board of commissioners in accordance with the procedures established in article III. Specific conditions for some of these uses are established in the zoning district standards and articles VII and VIII.
(d)
Prohibited uses. A blank cell in an authorized use matrix means that the use is prohibited in the applicable zoning district.
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-505. - Uses not listed in authorized land use tables.
In the case where a use is not listed in any authorized use matrix of the UDO, and such use is not otherwise prohibited by law, the community development director shall determine whether a substantially similar use exists in the use matrix. If the community development director determines that a substantially similar use exists, then the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed. In making the determination, the community development director shall consider the purposes of the zoning district and the following rules of construction:
(a)
Because the list of permissible uses set forth in the authorized use tables cannot be all-inclusive; those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally by the community development director to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses.
(b)
If a use cannot be interpreted by the community development director for inclusion in an authorized land use table, that use shall be prohibited. Authorized land use tables shall not be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another use that is permissible in other zoning districts.
(c)
If, when seeking periodic ratification of interpretations through text amendment to this UDO, the community development director's interpretation is reversed by action of the board of adjustment, then prior decisions regarding a development application made in reliance on the community development director's interpretation shall be valid, except that non-conforming use regulations of this UDO shall apply to the use.

Sec. 114-508. - Agricultural and agricultural/residential district use conditions.
The following use standards shall apply in addition to the standards established for specified uses in article VII.
(a)
In the A-5 district:
(1)
Retail sales are limited to agricultural products grown or raised on the premises.
(2)
Outdoor recreation uses are limited to low intensity activities that do not involve the use of motorized vehicles or rides, such as go carts, all-terrain vehicles, or carousels. Examples of low intensity uses are:
a.
An unlighted, regulation-size or par three golf courses, including normal club house and pro shop activities, and other business activity associated with country clubs is permitted by right.
b.
Simulated combat course for paintball gun users.
c.
Unlighted recreation fields.
(3)
Commercial riding stables are allowed, provided that no building or enclosure for animals is located closer than 100 feet from any property line.
(4)
The maximum density for large farm animals, non-commercial, is 0.75 large animal units per acre or a minimum of 1.33 acres for each animal unit. For commercial farming, the operator shall comply with all State and federal requirements.
a.
A large farm animal unit shall be considered one horse, one cow, one pig, five sheep or five goats. Other large animal units shall be calculated based on the formula of one animal unit equals 500 lbs. of average mature animal weight.
b.
For purposes of this section, lot area must equal or exceed the minimum area for an entire large farm animal to allow an animal. For example, two horses may be kept on a lot that is at least two and two-thirds (2.67) acres, and approximately four acres is required for three horses (3 horses * 1.33 acres/horse = 3.99 acres).
(5)
There shall be no more than one principal building per lot for parcels less than 25 acres. Parcels containing 25 acres or more will be allowed one additional principal building on the parcel.
(6)
Structures that are accessory to a bona fide agricultural use may be established in the absence of another principal structure.
(7)
A maximum of one accessory structure, not used for agricultural purposes, may be constructed and occupied before a principal building is established. The accessory structure shall be used solely for personal use and may not be used for or in the furtherance of a commercial operation of any kind. If a principal structure has not been constructed, the maximum size of the accessory structure may not exceed 750 square feet.
(b)
In RR-2.5, RR-1.5 and RR-1 districts:
(1)
There shall be no more than one principal building per lot for parcels less than 25 acres. Parcels containing 25 acres or more will be allowed one additional principal building on the parcel.
(2)
Accessory buildings used for bona-fide agricultural purposes may be constructed and established prior to the primary building being established. Only one accessory building may be used for agricultural purposes on lots smaller than two and one-half acres and the building shall not have more than 2,500 square feet of floor area.
(3)
Large farm animals are subject to the following limitations:
a.
Large farm animals include any hooved livestock, such as cows, horses, mules, sheep, goats, llamas, and other animal other than a dog (canis familiaris) with an adult weight of 50 pounds or more.
b.
Large farm animals may not be raised, kept or used for commercial purposes.
c.
The minimum lot size for keeping of a large farm animal is two acres.
d.
The maximum density for large farm animals is 0.75 large animal units per acre or a minimum of 1.33 acres for each animal unit.
e.
A large farm animal unit shall be considered one horse, one cow, one pig, five sheep, or five goats. Other large animal units shall be calculated based on the formula of one animal unit equals 500 lbs. of average mature animal weight.
f.
For purposes of this section, lot area must equal or exceed the minimum area for an entire large farm animal to allow an animal. For example, two horses may be kept on a lot that is at least two and one-half acres, and at least four acres is required for three horses (4 acres * 0.75 animals/acre = 3 large animal units).
g.
Enclosures for large farm animals shall be kept at least 100 feet from property lines. For purposes of this section, an enclosure is a physical structure such as a barn or a shed. A fence is not an enclosure.
h.
The non-commercial keeping of one or more pigs is allowed within a RR-2.5 district on a lot encompassing five or more acres, subject to the large animal limitations applicable to the A-5 district.
(4)
Small farm animals are subject to the following limitations:
a.
Small farm animals include poultry, rabbits and similarly sized animals. Dogs and other domesticated pets that are customarily kept within a household are not considered to be small farm animals subject to the provisions of this section.
b.
Small farm animals may not be raised, kept, or used for commercial purposes.
c.
The minimum lot size for keeping of small animals is one acre. For properties that are a minimum of one acre but less than two and a half acres in size, the maximum number of small animals, collectively, allowed on the property shall be 20. For properties greater than two and a half acres, the maximum number of small animals allowed on the property shall be five additional small animals per half acre with a maximum of 50, collectively.
d.
Enclosures for small farm animals shall be kept at least 50 feet from property lines. In the RR-1 and RR-1.5 districts, poultry shall be kept in an enclosure, which for purposes of this section shall be a physical structure such as a barn, coop, chicken run, or shed.
e.
In the RR-1 and RR-1.5 districts, poultry shall be limited to chickens. Poultry (domesticated birds) such as turkeys, guinea hens, roosters, peafowl, and squab are prohibited.
(c)
In any Agricultural or Rural Residential district: Public utilities substation or sub-installation including water towers are allowed on any sized lot, provided that:
(1)
Such use is enclosed by a painted or chain-link fence or wall at least eight feet in height above finished grade;
(2)
There is no office, commercial operation or storage of vehicles or equipment on the premises; and
(3)
A landscaped strip not less than five feet in width is planted and suitably maintained around the facility.

This district's regulations are designed to provide a compatible environment for uses generally classified as light industrial in nature; to protect and reserve undeveloped areas within the County that are suitable for such light industries; and to discourage encroachment by residential, commercial, or other uses that may adversely affect the industrial character of the district. Lands within this district should be located for easy access to the County's thoroughfare network, as well as rail and air, if required. Development should be designed so that uses within the district do not disrupt normal traffic flow patterns within the County. Planned industrial parks are encouraged within this district.

The district's regulations are designed to provide a compatible environment for waste processing and treatment facilities so that they will not be encroached upon by other uses or be adversely impacted by nearby conflicting land uses. Lands designated for waste management should be located in relation to the transportation systems it will utilize so that it will not disrupt normal traffic flow patterns within the County. Due to the special nature of waste and the potential health and environmental risks involved, this district will be only designated on the zoning map in response to a specific rezoning request by an applicant.

(b)
"DM-1" Dunes and Marshlands Districts. This district is intended to protect those areas of the county that are considered to be environmentally sensitive due to soil types, drainage, vegetation, wildlife habitats or other factors that are subject to being seriously endangered, damaged, or destroyed if allowed to develop in a manner inconsistent with their conservation and preservation. Since the welfare and well-being of the citizens of the County are directly linked to the natural environment of the area, maintaining sensitive areas in their natural condition to the greatest extent possible is necessary to protect such areas from degradation. Areas that meet any one of the following criteria shall be considered an environmentally sensitive area and subject to the conditions of this district which may be applied to such areas:
(1)
Marshland. All land subject to tidal action which is comprised of generally unstable soil materials commonly known as "hard or soft" marsh grass, reeds and similar growth and is usually characterized by poor load bearing capacity. Marshland lies below an elevation of 5.6 feet above mean sea level.

DIVISION 7. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 114-526. - Purpose.
To enable the application of flexible land development and use regulations that facilitate creative development patterns that achieve the goals of the comprehensive plan and this UDO better than development under conventional zoning districts. PD zoning is intended to encourage ingenuity and imagination on the part of architects, site planners and developers, to foster creative designs that may deviate from the strict application of use, setback, height, and the minimum lot size requirements of the County's other zoning districts. This flexibility is provided with the expectation that PDs will include more open space and amenities than are required for typical developments. PDs must include a program for the maintenance and operation of all common areas, amenities, neighborhood improvements, facilities, and necessary services for the common use of all occupants thereof. More specifically, the PD should:
Example: Diverse housing plans create more interesting neighborhoods
(a)
Require a compatible mix of uses and/or residential dwelling types. If a PD is proposed to be solely residential, the PD shall have a minimum of two different housing types (e.g., single family and townhouses, condominiums and apartments, etc.), each comprising no fewer than ten percent of the total number of dwelling units;
(b)
Allow for development of complete neighborhoods that include parks, open spaces, civic uses, schools, playgrounds, meeting areas and recreational facilities that enhance the development's livability;
(c)
Preserve natural amenities of land through the maintenance of wetlands, natural areas and other open spaces;
(d)
Provide for more efficient use of land;
(e)
Allow for non-residential uses that support the needs of the development and surrounding neighborhoods; and
(f)
Ensure that designs and building forms are interrelated and architecturally harmonious.
Example: tree retention provides a natural amenity
( Ord. No. 06-2020 , § 3, 12-8-2020)
Sec. 114-527. - Standards.
The P&Z commission and the board of commissioners shall consider the following standards when reviewing the PD application pursuant to article III, division 3:
(a)
Compatibility with the surrounding area;
(b)
Harmony with the character of neighborhoods within and surrounding the development;
(c)
Need for the proposed development;
(d)
The effects of the proposed PD upon the existing land uses and infrastructure in the surrounding areas;
(e)
The effects of the proposed PD on the future development of the area;
(f)
Whether or not an exception from the zoning ordinance requirements and limitations is warranted by virtue of the design and amenities incorporated in the development;
(g)
That the land within and surrounding the proposed PD can be developed in coordination with the proposed PD in a manner that is consistent with the comprehensive plan;
(h)
That the proposed change to a PD district is in conformance with the general intent of the comprehensive plan and this UDO;
(i)
That the existing and proposed streets are suitable and adequate to safely carry anticipated traffic within the proposed district and in the vicinity of the proposed district and maintain an acceptable level of service;
(j)
That the existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the proposed development;
(k)
That the PD creates a desirable and stable environment; and
(l)
That the PD is necessary for the creation of a creative, innovative, and efficient use of the property.
Example: Front porches and garage location keep focus on neighbors instead of cars
