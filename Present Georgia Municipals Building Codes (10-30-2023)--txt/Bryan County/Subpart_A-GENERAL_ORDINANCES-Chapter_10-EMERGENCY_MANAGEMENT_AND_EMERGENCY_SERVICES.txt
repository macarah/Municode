Sec. 10-24. - Statutory authorization.
The general assembly of the state, in the Georgia Emergency Management Act of 1981 (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-1 et seq.), authorizes and directs each county to establish a local organization for emergency management in accordance with the state emergency management plan and program; and in the state Constitution, article IX, section II, Home Rule for Counties, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners of the county, acting under the authority granted to it by the Georgia Emergency Management Act, as amended, does ordain and enact into law the provisions hereof.
(Code 1996, § 22-101; Ord. of 6-2-1998)
Sec. 10-25. - Purpose and objectives.
(a)
General. Because of the existing and increasing possibility of the occurrence of emergencies or disasters resulting from manmade or natural causes or enemy attack, and in order to ensure that preparations of the county will be adequate to deal with such emergencies or disasters, and generally to provide for the common defense and to protect the public peace, health, and safety, and to preserve the lives and property of the people of the county, it is found and declared to be necessary:
(1)
To create a county emergency management agency;
(2)
To confer upon the chairman of the county commission or the chairman's designee the emergency powers provided in O.C.G.A. title 38, ch. 3, arts. 1 (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-1 et seq.), 2 (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-20 et seq.) and 3 (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-50 et seq.);
(3)
To provide for the rendering of mutual aid among the political subdivisions of the county, with other counties, and with the state and federal governments with respect to the carrying out of emergency management functions; and
(4)
To authorize the taking of such steps as are necessary and appropriate to carry out the requirements of O.C.G.A. title 38, ch. 3, arts. 1 (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-1 et seq.), 2 (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-20 et seq.) and 3 (O.C.G.A. § 38-3-50 et seq.).
(b)
Coordination. It is further declared to be the purpose of this article and the policy of the county that all emergency management functions of the county be coordinated to the maximum extent possible with the comparable functions of the state and federal governments, including their various departments and agencies, of other counties, states, and localities, and of private agencies of every type, to the end that the most effective preparation and use may be made of the nation's manpower, resources, and facilities for dealing with any emergency or disaster that may occur.
(Code 1996, § 22-103; Ord. of 6-2-1998)
Sec. 10-26. - Emergency management.
(a)
Emergency management function. The term "emergency management" means the preparation for, and the carrying out of, all emergency and disaster functions other than those functions for which military forces or other state and federal agencies are primarily responsible to prevent, minimize, and repair injury and damage resulting from emergencies or disasters, or the imminent threat thereof, of manmade or natural origin. These functions include, without limitation to, firefighting services, police services, medical and health services, rescue, engineering, warning services, communications, defense from radiological, chemical and other special weapons, evacuation of persons from stricken areas, emergency welfare services, emergency transportation, plant protection, temporary restoration of public utility services, and other functions related to civilian population, together with all other activities necessary or incidental to total emergency and disaster preparedness for carrying out the foregoing functions.
(b)
Emergency management concept of operations.
(1)
Pre-emergency phase. Planning and preparation for an emergency by the Bryan Emergency Management Agency (BEMA) is an on-going activity that is funded, staffed, and managed on a countywide basis by the county through its county emergency management agency. Funding for BEMA is appropriated annually by the county commission with supplementary matching federal funding made available through the state from the emergency management agency. BEMA's mission is to create the highest possible state of emergency readiness and to be prepared to react promptly to save life and property in the county or any of its municipalities when threatened or hit by an emergency or a major disaster of any type and to accomplish the missions assigned to each department or agency in the plan.
(2)
Emergency phase. Emergency response plans are based upon the principle that local authorities bear the initial responsibilities for disaster relief. Each level of government accomplishes the functions for which it is responsible, requesting assistance from the next higher level of government only after resources at the requesting level have been expended or are clearly inadequate to cope with the effects of the emergency or disaster.
a.
Increased readiness period. During the emergency phase, operational activities of BEMA switch from being a one man county agency engaged in emergency readiness activities to activation of the county emergency and disaster plan. This is the time before the emergency or disaster strikes when severe weather conditions or domestic unrest poses a threat of serious harm to the county. During this period of time, the plan is activated and the BEMA director calls the emergency operations center (EOC) coordination staff together and either activates or prepares to activate the EOC.
b.
Emergency operations. During the period of time that the plan is activated, BEMA and its director perform the inter-governmental coordination role described in the plan. Each local government is responsible for, and has the power and authority to perform, emergency management functions within the territorial limits of the political subdivision within which it is organized, and, in addition, shall conduct such functions outside of such territorial limits as it may have agreed to in the mutual aid agreements and so signified by signing the county emergency and disaster operations plan.
(3)
Recovery phase.
a.
This is the time when BEMA begins to plan and carry out action to return the community to normal. This phase can be subdivided into four overlapping periods. In the first of these (first period), the emergency period, the emergency plan is normally in operation and attention is paid to pressing agent-generated demands. The problems caused directly and indirectly by destruction and by the associated needs of the dead, injured, homeless, and missing provide the focus of attention. During this period, normal, social, and economic activities are suspended or greatly modified. Depending on the nature of the disaster agent, scale of loss, and the preparedness and capacity of BEMA and this community to respond to the emergency, the emergency period may last for as little as a day or as long as several weeks. It can be considered over when search and rescue operations have ceased, major transportation arteries have been cleared and are functioning once more, emergency mass feeding has been reduced, and immediate temporary housing needs have been met.
b.
The emergency period gives way to the restoration period (second period) which is characterized by repairs to utilities, commercial, industrial, and residential structures. Those buildings that cannot be salvaged will be demolished and efforts will be made to return to relatively normal economic and social activities. By the end of this restoration period, major urban services, transportation, and utilities are functioning effectively again, debris has been removed, and those refugees who intend to return to their homes or temporary housing will have done so.
c.
The replacement reconstruction period is the period (third period) during which capital stores are rebuilt and the economy recovers to pre-disaster levels or higher. This phase ends when population has returned to its pre-disaster level and losses in jobs, residences, and urban activities have been compensated for. Certain types of reconstruction will be under-taken long after this phase is over, but these will be major projects. Typically, replacement reconstruction takes several years to complete.
d.
The last period (fourth period) in the recovery of a county or city from disaster has been termed the commerative, betterment, and developmental reconstruction period. During this final recovery period, reconstruction serves three differing but often interrelated functions:
1.
Commemoration of the disaster;
2.
Formation of future growth and development; and
3.
Financing and marketing of betterment and improvement programs and projects.
Characteristically, such projects are very large in scale and usually financed by public funds. Such projects are usually stimulated by the disaster recovery process and the community energy generated by the disaster. Not every disaster will have a fourth period to it, depending upon the nature and severity of the emergency or disaster.

Sec. 10-27. - Office of the county emergency management director.
There is hereby established the county emergency management office which shall perform emergency management functions countywide in the county. The county commissioners shall nominate to the state director of emergency management for appointment by the governor, a director of emergency management for the entire county. When appointed, the director is charged with the following duties:
(1)
To represent the governing officials of the county and its municipalities on matters pertaining to emergency management;
(2)
To assist county and municipal officials in organizing county and municipal departments for emergency operations;
(3)
To assist county department and municipal officials and directors with the development of emergency operating procedures (SOPs) for each of the local governmental, private, or volunteer organizations that will be responding to the emergency. Each organization must develop its own emergency response plan with BEMA assistance, and it shall be closely coordinated with BEMA's emergency and disaster operations plan which is an overall coordination plan;
(4)
To develop in conjunction with municipal and county departments and agencies, the county emergency and disaster plan for emergency functions as defined in section 10-22. The plan will be in consonance with the state natural disaster operations plan and nuclear emergency operations plan, and shall be submitted to the governing officials of the county and its municipalities for approval, and thence to the state emergency management director for approval;
(5)
To maintain the county emergency management agency and/or department at the highest possible state of emergency readiness as defined herein, and carry out the day-to-day administration of the county emergency management program, including the submission of required reports to the state emergency management agency;
(6)
To submit reports and plans as required by federal, state, and local authorities in keeping with good management practices (e.g., financial, management activities, etc.);
(7)
To operate and manage a facility to be used as the county emergency operations center (EOC); and
(8)
To coordinate the activities of the county emergency operations center staff during periods of a declared emergency.
(Code 1996, § 22-106; Ord. of 6-2-1998)
Sec. 10-28. - County emergency management agency and emergency plan.
(a)
BEMA.
(1)
The Bryan Emergency Management Agency (BEMA) shall be established around existing municipal and county departments and agencies, and the emergency functions listed in section 10-26 are assigned as follows:
EXPAND
Department Emergency Functions
County and municipal elected officials Policy direction/financial resources
County and municipal managers Direction and control, public information,
administration
Sheriff, city police departments Traffic control, security, law enforcement, mass detention, search, communications, warning, and evacuation
Fire services, county and cities Fire services, rescue, hazardous materials,
clearing operations
Public works and engineering Public services damage restoration, debris
removal
Human resources, including:
1. Department of family and child services
2. County health department
3. County EMS units
4. Board of education Human needs, including: welfare, social services, shelter and feeding, health services, medical and casualty transportation, evacuation
transportation
County tax assessor, planning and zoning
departments Damage assessment teams
Emergency management Emergency planning, shelter, radiological
defense, rescue, assistance in industrial
emergency planning, evacuation planning,
emergency transportation, hazards analysis, damage assessment, communications, volunteer rescue services
    (2)
The director of BEMA shall have direct responsibility for the organization, administration, and operation of the local organization for emergency management, subject to the direction and control of the county commission chairman and county administrator or their designee. Because the county emergency management agency is a countywide organization that coordinates the activities of each municipal and county department or agency, each local government retains authority over its own staff and equipment resources but subordinates itself to the overall coordination and direction of BEMA during an emergency. The extent of the participation of each local government during an emergency is determined in advance by the plan.
(3)
The director is responsible for ensuring that all of the duties and responsibilities assigned to BEMA by the Georgia Emergency Management Act of 1981 (O.C.G.A. § 38-1-1 et seq.), and subsequent changes, are fulfilled to the highest degree possible given the resources provided for BEMA, including the specific duties listed in this section.
(4)
BEMA is responsible for assisting each participating municipal, county, private and volunteer organization, agency, or department that agrees to assist BEMA or participate in the emergency management program with the development of simple, workable, and understandable emergency standing operating procedures (SOP). The purpose of having such an emergency SOP is to ensure that the emergency response unit (department, agency, etc.) is organized and knows exactly what, when, and how it is to do its emergency response function. Such emergency SOPs will be submitted through the BEMA director to the appropriate local governing body for approval.
(b)
The emergency and disaster plan.
(1)
The county emergency management agency shall develop and periodically update the emergency and disaster plan for the purpose of establishing policies, procedures, programs, and projects to implement this article and enable the county and municipal governments to respond to natural and manmade emergency situations.
(2)
The director of BEMA is responsible for the development, execution, and coordination of the county emergency and disaster plan. The plan shall be developed in close coordination with the state emergency management agency. It shall also be based on recommended principles and practices promulgated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other recognized emergency and disaster preparedness agencies and relief organizations.
(3)
The plan shall be submitted to the county administrator and state emergency management agency for review, comment, and recommendation to the county commission. The plan shall be adopted by the county commission by resolution and may be changed and updated periodically by resolution.
(c)
Activation of the county emergency and disaster plan. The county emergency and disaster plan shall become operative as follows:
(1)
Automatically by the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state as either a statewide, regional, or local area emergency or emergency alert; or
(2)
Automatically by the declaration of a local state of emergency or threat thereof by the county commission chairman or vice-chairman, or other successor to the chairman in the event of his unavailability; or
(3)
On order of the BEMA director, provided that the existence or threatened existence of a local emergency has been declared by the governor; or the director is acting as the designee of the chairman of the county commission.
a.
The BEMA director is hereby authorized to order the mobilization of any appropriate emergency response organization, or any portion thereof, as required to provide for increased readiness in the event of the threatened existence of an emergency prior to the activation of the county emergency and disaster plan.
b.
The BEMA director is further authorized to order the activation of the full county emergency and disaster plan and all emergency response organizations in the event that an emergency has already occurred but neither the county commission chairman nor his successor are available, nor can they be communicated with in a timely fashion; or, upon the request of the mayor, legally appointed successor, or the governing body of any county municipality or adjacent local government experiencing an emergency or disaster within their jurisdiction.

State Law reference— Local organization for emergency management, O.C.G.A. § 38-3-27.
Sec. 10-29. - Emergency response powers of the county and municipal governments.
(a)
Declaration of local state of emergency or disaster and proclamation thereof.
(1)
In the event of actual or impending emergency or disaster or natural or manmade origin, or impending or actual enemy attack or pandemic influenza emergency or public health emergency, anywhere within the county, the county commission chairman or vice-chairman or designee may declare that a local state of emergency or disaster exists. The local state of emergency or disaster shall continue for 30 days (unless extended) or until the county commission chairman or designee finds that the threat or danger has passed or the emergency or disaster has been dealt with, to the extent that emergency or disaster conditions no longer exist, and terminates the local state of emergency or disaster, whichever comes first.
(2)
No local state of emergency or disaster may continue for longer than 45 days unless renewed by the county commission chairman or successor in the event of his unavailability. The county commission, by resolution, may terminate a local state of emergency or disaster at any time. Thereupon, the county commission chairman shall, by appropriate action, end the local state of emergency or disaster.
(3)
A declaration of a local state of emergency or disaster shall automatically activate the county emergency and disaster plan. Further, such declaration shall automatically activate the response and recovery aspects of the plan as applicable to the political subdivision or area in question and shall be authority for the deployment and use of any forces to which the plan(s) apply and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, and materials and facilities assembled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made available pursuant to articles 1 through 3 of the Georgia Emergency Management Act or any other law(s) relating to emergencies or disasters.
(4)
Upon the declaration of a local state of emergency or upon activation of the county emergency and disaster plan, in accordance with any of the procedures established in this article, the county commission chairman, county administrator, BEMA director, or their designee should normally prepare an official proclamation of the establishment of the local state of emergency and communicate said proclamation to the citizens of the county using the most effective and efficient means available. The proclamation shall indicate the nature of the local emergency or disaster, the geographic area(s) affected by the proclamation, the conditions which required the proclamation to be established and the conditions under which it will be terminated.
(b)
Emergency powers of the county and municipal governments. The county commission chairman shall have and may exercise for such period as the local state of emergency or disaster exists or continues, unless the state government assumes direct control of the emergency or disaster and the county's efforts are subordinated to the state, the following additional emergency powers within the unincorporated areas of the county:
(1)
To enforce all laws, rules, and regulations relating to emergency management and to assume direct operational control of all civil forces and helpers in the unincorporated area of the county.
(2)
To seize, take for temporary use, or condemn property for the protection of the public in accordance with condemnation proceedings as provided by state law.
(3)
To perform and exercise such other functions, powers, and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population of the county.
(4)
To coordinate the exercise of the above emergency powers within the incorporated areas of the county with the mayors of the municipalities that may be affected by the emergency or disaster.
(5)
To appropriate and expend funds, execute contracts, and obtain and distribute equipment, materials, and supplies as required for the emergency or disaster.
(6)
In addition to any other emergency powers conferred upon the county commission chairman by law, he may specifically:
a.
Authorize the removal of fallen trees, debris and wreckage caused by any emergency or disaster within 50 feet from the centerline of driveways, private roads or vehicle access lanes (if county right-of-way extends beyond the 50 feet centerline specified, work forces can go up to 20 feet beyond right-of-way) and within 100 feet of any primary residential dwelling, office, commercial or industrial structure. When working on private property, assurance must be given by the property owner(s) that they will hold the county, state, and federal governments harmless for damages that may occur;
b.
Suspend any regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster;
c.
Utilize all available resources of the county government and subordinate agencies over which it has budgetary control as reasonably necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster;
d.
Transfer the direction, personnel, or functions of any county department and agencies or units thereof for the purpose of performing or facilitating emergency services;
e.
Commandeer or utilize any private property if the county commission chairman or his successor or designee finds this necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster;
f.
Direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area within the county, if the chairman deems this action necessary, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response, or recovery;
g.
Prescribe routes, modes of transportation, and destinations in connection with evacuation;
