DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 2-19. - Rules of order and procedures.
The following provisions apply to meetings of the board of commissioners:
(1)
Quorum. A quorum must be present for conducting meetings of the board. A quorum is a majority of all of the members of the board then in office. It is the duty of the chairman to enforce this rule. Any commissioner may raise a point of order directed to the chairman if he believes that a quorum is not present. If, during the course of a meeting, a commissioner leaves and a quorum no longer exists, the meeting cannot continue. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the meeting will be rescheduled by the chairman with the approval of the commissioners present.
(2)
Voting, majority. Passage of a motion shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of commissioners present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Unless otherwise specified in these procedures, a majority shall mean at least one-half of the commissioners present, excluding abstentions.
(3)
Abstentions. A commissioner shall vote on all motions unless he has a conflict of interest which would prevent him from making a decision in a fair and legal manner. If a conflict of interest does exist, the commissioner shall explain for the record his decision to abstain on any vote.
(4)
Chairman. The chairman of the board of commissioners is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting. In order to fulfill this duty, the chairman must enforce the rules of procedure that are adopted by the board of commissioners. The chairman shall be impartial and conduct the meetings in a fair manner. The chairman may not introduce motions or second a motion, except that the chairman may introduce or second a motion to go into executive session as authorized by subsection (16) of this section.
(5)
Vice-chairman. The board shall select a vice-chairman from the board members at the beginning of each calendar year. The vice-chairman shall fulfill the duties of the chairman if the chairman is not in attendance. If the chairman and the vice-chairman are absent and a quorum is present, the remaining commissioners shall select a commissioner to serve as temporary chairman of the meeting until either the chairman or vice-chairman is present at the meeting.
(6)
Agenda. The county administrator, with the advice of the chairman and the commissioners, shall prepare an agenda of subjects to be acted on for each meeting. An agenda work session shall be held by the county administrator to finalize the agenda. The chairman and all commissioners may participate in the work session. Whenever a quorum of the board is present for an agenda work session, the meeting shall be open to the public and all notice and recordkeeping requirements applicable to an open meeting must be met. The agenda shall be made available to the commissioners at least one business day before every board meeting. Members of the public may request that a particular subject be placed on the agenda for the following meeting. To be considered, this request must be submitted in writing to the county administrator and received at least five business days before the meeting. The order of the agenda may be changed during a meeting by a majority vote of the board. A new subject that requires attention may be added to the agenda during a meeting by a two-thirds vote of the board. A copy of the agenda and a list of those members present shall be made available to the public for inspection within two business days of the adjournment of any meeting.
(7)
Consent agenda. A consent agenda may be prepared by the county administrator for the board to unanimously adopt motions on routine items. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and where no debate is expected may be placed on a consent agenda. At the appropriate time of the meeting, the chairman shall read all of the items on the consent agenda. If a commissioner objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the chairman shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. Following the reading of the consent agenda, the chairman will ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda. If there are no objections, all the items on the consent agenda will be adopted by unanimous consent.
(8)
Minutes. The clerk of the board shall promptly record the minutes for each board meeting. The minutes serve as the official written record of the board meeting. More detailed information than that required by law may be included in the minutes at the request of the board. The board must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the board. A copy of the minutes from the previous regularly scheduled meeting shall be distributed to the commissioners at least one business day before the following regularly scheduled meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting shall be corrected and approved by the board at the beginning of each regularly scheduled meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts about the content of the minutes shall be decided by majority vote. Upon being approved, the minutes shall be signed by the chairman and attested to by the clerk of the board of commissioners.

The chairman shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a commissioner believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can rule on the question or he can allow the board to debate the issue and decide the issue by majority vote.

b.
Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the board may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the board.

These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. Anyone wishing to speak at any board meeting must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the board.
c.
Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a board meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for commissioners.

An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairman.
d.
Public hearings. The board may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board.

(12)
Parliamentarian. The county attorney shall serve as the parliamentarian for board meetings.
(13)
Amendments to rules. Any amendments to the rules of order must be submitted by a commissioner in writing to the county administrator five business days before a regular meeting of the board.

Any such minutes shall be maintained in a confidential file and shall not be subject to disclosure, except that disclosures of such portions of minutes identifying real estate to be acquired by the board may only be delayed until such time as the acquisition of the real estate has been completed, terminated, or abandoned or court proceedings have been initiated.
(17)
Suspending the rules of order. Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a two-thirds vote of the board. Rules governing quorum (subsection (1) of this section), voting methods and requirements (subsections (2) and (3) of this section), the notification to commissioners of meetings (subsection (15) of this section) and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended.
(18)
Committees. The chairman, with the concurrence of the board, may create committees of members of the board to study any issue before the board. Any such committees may make recommendations to the board of commissioners but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decision on any matter before it for consideration. In addition to board members, committees may include other county officials, staff or citizens at large. Whenever a committee is created, its duties, any limitation on the scope of its duties, and the times, places and periods of time for which the committee may operate shall be determined by the chairman with the concurrence of the board. The chairman shall serve as an ex officio member of all committees.

Sec. 2-99. - Short title.
This division will be known as and may be referred and cited as the "Ethics Code of Bryan County" ("ethics code").
(Code 1996, § 2-201)
Sec. 2-100. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
The board of commissioners of the county believes that public service is a public trust. Maintaining that public trust requires the county to protect against improper influence or the appearance of improper influence. The purpose should be to ensure that public officials will be impartial and use independent judgement in carrying out their duties. To help ensure this quality, the board of commissioners finds and declares the need to establish appropriate ethical standards for conduct.
(b)
The board of commissioners of the county does not intend that this division impede the desire for those who want to seek and serve in public office. To this end, public officials should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens. Public service should not restrict the ability to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests. Only in those cases in which a conflict of the public's trust and interest would result should a restriction be applied.
(c)
This division follows the precedent of earlier federal, state and local codes. Related local code chapters can be found in the personnel code. It makes clear those standards of ethical conduct that will apply to public officials in the discharge of their official duties; implements the objective of protecting the integrity of the government; and prescribes only such essential restrictions against conflicts of interest so as not to impose unnecessary barriers against public service.
