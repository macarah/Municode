ARTICLE 18. - SIGN REGULATIONS[9]

Footnotes:
--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3, adopted April 27, 2004, amended article 18 in its entirety to read as herein set out. The provisions of Ord. of 4-27-2004(2) were specifically delineated as §§ 3-7-1—3-7-19; hence, the inclusion of these provisions, as specified on the ordinance, was at the discretion of the editor. For stylistic purposes, capitalization has been changed to conform to the Code of Ordinances; however, internal references remain unchanged from the original ordinance. Former article 18, §§ 1801—1813, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from the county's zoning ordinance, as adopted by the board of commissioners on October 27, 1998.

Sec. 3-7-1. - Title.
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Screven County Sign Ordinance".
(Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3)
Sec. 3-7-2. - Purpose.
Sign regulations achieve public safety rationales not achieved by standard building code provisions. Without a sign ordinance, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has long been recognized that sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. Signs can distract motorists by impairing visibility. Traffic safety is improved by restricting the size, height, and location of signs. Signs, if unregulated, can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs.
Unregulated signs may negatively affect the character of communities and the value of buildings. For example, blighted signs and antiquated signs and sign structures (i.e., the pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can contribute to an overall image of blight and a reduction of property values in declining areas if not addressed and removed via sign controls. Unregulated signs can reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public because they compete with public purpose signs and reduce their visibility and effectiveness. Unregulated signage in special character areas, such as the downtown, would almost assuredly neutralize any public plans and investments to improve streetscapes.
Sign regulation serves the interests of the business community. Unregulated competition among businesses where individual business signs are not adequately visible results in too many signs and a point of diminishing returns. Sign regulations help to maintain the scenic heritage and unique character of the community. Signs substantially influence the appearance of the community, and sign regulation is essential to the community's long-term economic viability. Sign controls improve visual character.
This ordinance is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests by correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs and advertising devices. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this statement of purposes.
(Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3)
Sec. 3-7-3. - Intent.
It is not the intent of this ordinance to apply regulation to signs because of a disagreement with the message that they convey, to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political, religious, or personal messages, or to suggest the county regulate the message content of signs in any manner. It is, however, the intent of this ordinance to regulate the time, place, and manner of signs in a minimal manner sufficient to meet the public purposes articulated in the purpose section of this ordinance.
Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this sign ordinance, any sign, display or device allowed under this ordinance may contain any commercial or non-commercial message, or any political or non-political message; except that such messages cannot depict obscenity, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 16-12-80, nor can they depict sexual conduct or sexually explicit nudity, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3, nor advertise any activity illegal under the laws of Georgia or the United States.
(Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3; Ord. of 4-13-2021(2), § 40)
Sec. 3-7-4. - Applicability.
A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained within the planning jurisdiction of the county only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this ordinance.
The effect of this ordinance as more specifically set forth herein shall:
(a)
Establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial, residential and industrial areas that are subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this ordinance.
(b)
Allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive, and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this ordinance, but without a requirement for permits.
(c)
Provide for temporary signs without commercial messages in limited circumstances in the public right-of-way.
(d)
Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this ordinance.

(Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3; Ord. of 4-13-2021(2), § 40)
Sec. 3-7-13. - Computations.
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height.
3-7-13.1. Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall.
3-7-13.2. Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
3-7-13.3. Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest point of the sign face. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade of the sign is lower than the grade of the adjacent public street, normal grade shall be construed to be the grade of the adjacent public street. "Adjacent public street" shall mean the street providing approved vehicle access to the property and which does or would bear the street address for the property.
3-7-13.4. Computation of maximum total permitted sign area. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.
(Ord. of 4-27-2004(2), § 3)
Sec. 3-7-14. - Design, construction, and maintenance.
All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards.
(a)
Except for banners, flags, and temporary signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this ordinance, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or other structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure.
(b)
Every sign, including, but not limited to those signs for which permits are required, shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and sound structural condition.
(1)
To prevent rust, peeling, flaking, fading or rotting, all signs and supports shall be painted, unless anodized or similarly treated.
(2)
Broken panels, missing letters, defective illumination, torn fabric, flaking or peeling paint and other damage to a sign, shall be replaced or repaired.
(c)
If a determination is made by the county that any sign is unsafe, not secure, in violation of this section, or is in violation of any applicable law or a public danger, notice of such violation shall be given to the property owner and/or occupant where such sign is located. The property owner and/or occupant shall have 30 days from the date of said notice to remove, repair, or remedy said violation.

Sec. 3-7-17. - Nonconforming signs and signs without permits.
3-7-17.1. Signs existing on effective date. O.C.G.A. 32-6-83 states, "Any municipal corporation or county is authorized to acquire by purchase, gift, or condemnation and to pay just compensation for any property rights in outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which were lawfully erected but which do not conform with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or which at a later date fail to comply with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or due to changed conditions beyond the control of the sign owner. No municipal corporation or county shall remove or cause to be removed any such nonconforming outdoor advertising sign, display, or device without paying just compensation." In accordance, signs existing in the planning jurisdiction which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this ordinance shall be permitted to remain in place and be maintained, provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity.

Sec. 3-7-18. - Criteria for approval of sign variances.
A variance may be granted upon application if an individual case of unusual hardship is placed upon the applicant. The request for a variance must meet the following conditions.
(a)
There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area.
(b)
A literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties.
(c)
Granting the variance requested would not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges that are denied to other similar properties.
(d)
The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.
(e)
The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant.
(f)
The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is prohibited by this ordinance.
(g)
The mere existence of a nonconforming sign or advertising device shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance.
