B.
Submission of application for PDR approval and subsequent development of such rezoned property.
1.
Conceptual site plan, to be submitted with the original rezoning application, to include:

C.
Review and approval of PDR application.
1.
An application for approval of a PDR is treated as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (rezoning). This is because PDR districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed PDR. Upon approval of the PDR, existing zoning must be changed to a PDR zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in section[s] 304 and 414 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the PDR. Approval of PDR zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the board of commissioners.
2.
If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the PDR district (section 304). If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the zoning administrator the following:
a.
Written notice of consent to the modifications.
b.
Properly revised site development plans.
3.
The official map will then be changed (section 304). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the zoning administrator.
4.
No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners.
D.
Issuance of building permits. The building official will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See section 408.)
E.
Revision of development plan after approval of plan.
1.
Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning and zoning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan.
2.
Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning and zoning commission in accordance with the provisions of sections 414 and 1702. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.
