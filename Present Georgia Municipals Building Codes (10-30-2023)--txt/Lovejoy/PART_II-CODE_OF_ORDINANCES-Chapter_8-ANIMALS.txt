Providing sterilization by a licensed veterinarian before relinquishing custody of the animal.
(2)
Entering into a written agreement with the person acquiring such animal guaranteeing that sterilization will be performed by a licensed veterinarian within 30 days after acquisition of such animal in the case of an adult animal or within 30 days of the sexual maturity of the animal in the case of an immature animal; provided, however, that the requirements of this section shall not apply to any privately-owned animal which any shelter, agency, society, or refuge may have in its possession for any reason, and the owner of such animal claims or presents evidence that such animal is the property of such person.
(b)
Fee and cost responsibility.
(1)
All costs of sterilization pursuant to this section shall be the responsibility of the person acquiring such animal and, if performed prior to acquisition, may be included in any fees charged by the shelter, agency, society, or refuge for such animal.
(2)
A sterilization bond shall be paid by the adopting person at the time of adoption. The amount of the sterilization bond shall be determined by the chief, county police department, or his designee; it shall not exceed the amount of the highest cost of sterilization charged by veterinarians participating in the sterilization bond program.
(3)
The sterilization bond is redeemed by the licensed veterinarian who performs the sterilization and completes the written statement attesting the same, who should be a licensed veterinarian who has agreed previously to participate in the sterilization bond program.
(4)
The adopting person may redeem the sterilization bond upon presentation of satisfactory proof of sterilization, in a manner acceptable to the county animal control unit commander. The remaining cost of sterilization, if any, shall be the sole responsibility of the adopting person.
(5)
The sterilization bond will have a fixed expiration date, determined by the due date of the sterilization; however, such expiration date and due date may be extended in accordance with the provisions of section 8-286 and subsection (i) of this section. Upon the expiration of the sterilization bond, the sterilization bond shall be forfeited to the county animal control unit.
(c)
Any person acquiring an animal from a public or private animal shelter, animal control agency operated by the state, county or a municipality, humane society, or public or private animal refuge, which animal is not sterile at the time of acquisition, shall submit to the animal shelter, animal control agency, humane society, or public or private animal refuge a signed statement from the licensed veterinarian performing the sterilization required by this section within seven days after such sterilization attesting that such sterilization has been performed.

In the event that the adopted dog or cat is stolen, the adopting person shall file a police report with the appropriate jurisdiction, stating the circumstances of theft and a description of the animal in as much detail as possible.
