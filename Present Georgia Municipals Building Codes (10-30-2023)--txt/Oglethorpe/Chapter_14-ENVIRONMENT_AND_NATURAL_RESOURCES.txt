ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY

Sec. 14-19. - Definitions.
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
Groundwater recharge area (aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
Pollution susceptibility map means a map, prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that shows the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18, (1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

Sec. 14-20. - Findings and objectives.
(a)
Findings of fact.
(1)
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water.
(2)
Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized.
(b)
Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
(1)
Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use, or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
(2)
Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
(3)
Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.
(Ord. of 6-4-2001(1), §§ 1.1—1.3)
Sec. 14-21. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district.
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands in the corporate limits of the city that are mapped and designated as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 Edition.
(Ord. of 6-4-2001(1), § 2)
Sec. 14-22. - Determination of pollution susceptibility.

(Ord. of 6-4-2001(2), § 10)
Sec. 14-119. - Findings of fact.
(a)
Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In its natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide:
(1)
Habitat for fish, wildlife, and vegetation;
(2)
Water quality maintenance and pollution control;
(3)
Flood control;
(4)
Erosion control;
(5)
Natural resource education;
(6)
Scientific study; and
(7)
Open space and recreational opportunities.
In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia.
(b)
Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is, therefore, necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely affect wetlands by ensuring maximum protection for wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city.

DIVISION 4. - WETLAND PROTECTION DISTRICT

Sec. 14-208. - Division application and boundaries.
(a)
Application. This division shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this chapter, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file at city hall.
(b)
Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a subject site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to initiation of any development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not represent precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this division does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
(Ord. of 6-4-2001(2), § 2)
Sec. 14-209. - Permissible uses; uses as of right.
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided herein:
(1)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit.
(2)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, birdwatching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing.
(3)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(4)
The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall; however, be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture.
(5)
The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.

(Ord. of 6-4-2001(2), § 3.5)
Sec. 14-212. - Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district.
Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options:
(1)
Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The planning and zoning commission may allow a reduction in lot size provided the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The permitting officer shall allow no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side, and front setbacks for each affected lot.
(2)
Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the planning and zoning commission may allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan.
