First suspension in a twelve-month period of time shall not exceed 30 days.
(2)
Second suspension within a twelve-month period of time shall not exceed 60 days.

Sec. 6-217. - Suspension/revocation of license; causes.
(a)
Due cause for the suspension or revocation of the licenses identified in section 6-216 (Suspension or revocation; notice of hearing; refund), shall include a violation of any laws or ordinances regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, or for the violation of any state or federal law, or for the violation of any city ordinances other than traffic ordinances or for any other legal and sufficient cause.
(b)
The violation of any term, condition or provision of this article in any particular, or as to any detail whatsoever, shall be cause for the suspension or revocation of any license as provided for in this article.
(c)
Whenever the state shall revoke any license to sell alcoholic beverages, the city license shall thereupon be automatically revoked. The city clerk shall take the necessary steps to see that signs are removed and that all alcoholic beverage sales cease.
(d)
Any material omission from or untrue or misleading information which is contained in an original, renewal or transfer application for a license shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for revocation of such license. Any failure to notify of the change in any relationship as specified in section 6-135 (change in relationships and/or ownership interest) within 30 days within such change is made shall likewise constitute due cause for cancellation, revocation or suspension of a license issued hereunder. Further, failure to pay all fees, taxes or other charges imposed under the provisions of this article shall constitute due cause for cancellation, revocation or suspension of a license issued hereunder.
(e)
Any licensed establishment that is found to be in violation of section 6-170 (types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited) or section 6-34 ("Happy hour" promotions and sales) of this Code shall be subject to immediate license suspension and the city clerk shall take action to revoke the license as provided for in this article, in addition to all other penalties provided for in this article.
(f)
Except as provided in section 6-178(e) (illegal sales of alcohol to minors), the city clerk shall take action to revoke the license of any licensee whose license has been suspended three or more times in any consecutive 36-month period.
(g)
The city clerk shall take action to revoke the license of any premises where alcoholic beverages have been sold or distributed during a period of suspension.
(h)
The city clerk may suspend or revoke the license of any establishment which does not meet the licensing qualifications set forth in this article any time such knowledge becomes known to him or her as provided for in this article.
(i)
In the case of an act of an employee, rather than the licensee, which presents cause for the suspension or revocation of a license, in determining whether to initiate such suspension or revocation hearings, the city clerk may take into consideration any documented evidence that the licensee has, on prior occasions, undertaken proactive efforts to promote compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the provisions of this chapter prohibiting the sale or serving of alcohol to minors. Documented evidence of such activities shall include, but shall not be limited to, written evidence that the licensee has promptly reported freely and of its own volition violations or attempted violations of this chapter.

Sec. 6-218. - Removal of signs.
When any license for the sale of alcoholic beverages is revoked, all signs indicating that such beverages may be sold or purchased shall immediately be removed from both inside and outside the place of business. Upon receipt by the ordinance enforcement officer of notice of revocation, the ordinance enforcement officer shall take the necessary steps to see that this section is enforced.

(a)
No license shall be denied, suspended, or revoked without the opportunity for a hearing as hereinafter provided.
(b)
The city clerk shall provide written notice to the applicant or licensee of his or her order or decision to deny, suspend, or revoke the license.

Any applicant or licensee who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final action of the city clerk may have a review thereof by appeal to the city council.

The city council may at the request of the appellant, refund the filing fee by a majority vote.
(c)
A hearing shall be conducted on each appeal within 30 days of the date of filing with the city clerk, unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the appellant and the city clerk.

All testimony shall be sworn.
(d)

Unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or
(3)
Unreasonable.
