Sec. 62-1. - Findings, purpose and intent.
(a)
The mayor and couuncil find that signs are an important and effective medium through which persons may convey a variety of messages, both commercial and non-commercial in character. The mayor and couuncil further find that the regulation of location, size, placement, height and other relevant physical characteristics of signs and sign structures is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, facilities and properties within the City of Berkeley Lake without difficulty or confusion; to improve the general aesthetic of the city; and to protect the value of properties therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of homes and businesses in the city in the event of police, fire or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. Left unregulated, signs can become a substantial threat to public safety by way of traffic or pedestrian hazards and a detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. The mayor and couuncil also find that the regulations contained herein directly advance the stated purposes and such regulations are narrowly tailored to serve the city's interests.
(b)
The city's purpose in enacting these regulations is to:
(1)
Balance the right of persons to convey their messages through signs with the right of the public to be protected from the adverse effects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs.
(2)
Enhance the economic health of existing and future businesses and industries within the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs advertising goods and services.
(3)
Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(4)
Provide for signs which are compatible with their surroundings.
(5)
Promote and protect the unique natural beauty and aesthetic qualities of the city
(6)
Reduce the probability of traffic or pedestrian accidents by restricting visual obstructions or distractions caused by signs or lights.
(7)
Create a comprehensive and balanced system of sign control that ensures the fair and consistent enforcement of the regulations and the proper maintenance, structural soundness, safety, appearance and attractiveness of signs and sign structures.
(8)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan, which is expressly incorporated herein.
(c)
Promote the state purposes of the city's zoning ordinance, which are expressly incorporated herein.These regulations are intended to ensure the protection of free speech rights guaranteed by the United State[s] Constitution and Georgia Constitution. They are not intended to and do not restrict the content of sign messages. These regulations do not apply to signs located on public property, including rights-of way. The placement, regulation and enforcement of signs on public lands, including rights-of-way, shall be in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations of the State of Georgia, Gwinnett County and the City of Berkeley Lake, as applicable.
