ARTICLE V. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION

Sec. 38-141. - Findings of fact.
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicant, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies.
(Ord. of 12-12-2000(2), § 1.1)
Sec. 38-142. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the following watershed, which occurs within the jurisdiction of the city and is herein identified as water supply watershed: Sherrills Creek Reservoir.
(Ord. of 12-12-2000(2), § 1.2)
Sec. 38-143. - Establishment of a water supply watershed district.
(a)
Generally. The Sherrills Creek Reservoir Water Supply Watershed District is hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains to Sherrills Creek Reservoir from the ridge line of the watershed. The boundary of the watershed district is defined by the ridge line of the watershed or by the political boundaries of the city where those boundaries occur within the watershed. The boundary shall be set at places readily identifiable on the watershed district map.
(b)
Water quality critical area. The water quality critical area is established for land that lies adjacent to the reservoir boundary and the banks of streams extending upstream to a radius of seven miles from the public water intake and extending to the ridge line boundary of the watershed. The boundary of the water quality critical area shall be set at places readily identifiable on the watershed district map.
(Ord. of 12-12-2000(2), § 2)
Sec. 38-144. - Permit requirements.
Within the water supply watershed district, no land-disturbing activity, construction or other development, other than certain exempted activities identified within, may be conducted without a permit from the city council and must be in full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
