Pursuant to Ga. Const. art. IX, § VII, as amended in 1984 (said amendment being set out at 1984 Ga. Laws, p. 1703), there is created one or more community improvement districts to be located in the City of Valdosta, wholly within the incorporated area thereof, each of which shall be activated upon compliance with the conditions provided in this act and which shall be governed by a board as constituted pursuant to this act. The conditions for such activation shall be:
(1)
The delivery of a petition by any taxpayer, containing the project specifications for the proposed district, to the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta;
(2)
The adoption of a resolution by the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta consenting to the creation of each community improvement district, which resolution shall state that the district is created under this act, and to the project specifications;
(3)
Written consent to the creation of the community improvement district by and the project specifications by:
(A)
A majority of the owners of real property within the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the administrative body of the community improvement district; and
(B)
The owners of real property within the community improvement district which constitutes at least 75 percent of value of all real property within the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the administrative body of the community improvement district; and for this purpose value shall be determined by the most recent approved Lowndes County ad valorem tax digest; and
(4)
If the proposed community improvement district is to lie in an area wholly or partially coexistent with one or more community improvement districts, then the governing board of the newly created district and the governing board of the preexisting district or districts shall have entered into a cooperative agreement whereby the collection of taxes and the provision of services in the overlapping areas of such districts shall be specified.

A copy of such resolutions shall be filed with the secretary of state, who shall maintain a record of all districts activated under this act, and with the department of community affairs.
(d)
The project specifications may be amended, changed, or expanded from time to time, but not so as to reduce taxes, fees, and assessments pledged to holders of bonds or other indebtedness of the district without such holders' written consent, by the adoption, certification, and filing of consents as described in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section.
Section 5. - Administration and appointment of board members.
Each district created pursuant to this act shall be administered by a six-member board appointed by the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta.
Section 6. - Taxes, fees, and assessments.
(a)
The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2½ percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property; provided, however, that no tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall exceed any lesser limitation designated in the project specifications and that no tax, fee, or assessment shall be levied beyond any time limitation designated as provided in the project specifications. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the applicable district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the City of Valdosta as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by the City of Valdosta. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as the City of Valdosta ad valorem taxes and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The process of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection thereof, shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized by this act.
(b)
The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and August 1 of each calendar year and shall notify in writing the City of Valdosta by September 1 of each year so it may include the levy on its regular ad valorem tax bills.
(c)
If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear the tax millage then extant upon such event for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded.
Section 7. - Boundaries of the districts.
(a)
The boundaries of each district shall be as designated by the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta and shall lie wholly within the incorporated area of the City of Valdosta, as set forth in the resolutions required in section 4 of this act or as may thereafter be added as hereinafter provided.
(b)
The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following:
(1)
Written consent of:
(A)
A majority of the owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the community improvement district; and
(B)
The owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which constitutes at least 75 percent by value of all real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the community improvement district; and for this purpose, value shall be determined by the most recently approved Lowndes County ad valorem tax digest;
(2)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and
(3)
The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta.
Section 8. - Debt.
Each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Ga. Const. art. IX, § V, or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia, the City of Valdosta, or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district.
Section 9. - Cooperation with local governments.
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta. If the parties to the cooperation agreement so agree, the cooperation agreement may provide that such private persons as are designated by the district perform the actual construction or improvement of the services and facilities provided by the district. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of the City of Valdosta to provide services or facilities within the district; and the City of Valdosta shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the City of Valdosta. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein.

Section 11. - Bonds, generally.
(a)
Notes or other obligations issued by a district other than general obligation bonds shall be paid solely from the property pledged to pay such notes or other obligations.

All bonds, notes, and other obligations of any district shall be authorized by resolution of its board, adopted by a majority vote of the board members at a regular or special meeting.

The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors.
(d)
The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this act.

(e)
There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, and the usury laws of this state shall not apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of these districts.

Bonds issued by a district shall be validated under and in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq., known as the "Revenue Bond Law," or in accordance with such other successor provision governing bond validation generally as may be provided by law. Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the superior court of Lowndes County shall be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated, and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.

(i)
The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district.

(c)
Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude such board from issuing other bonds, notes, or obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.
Section 13. - Construction; applicability of O.C.G.A. § 10-5-1 et seq., the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973"; notice, proceeding, publication, referendum.
This act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by a district shall not be subject to regulation under O.C.G.A. § 10-5-1 et seq., the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973." No notice, proceeding, or publication except those required by this act shall be necessary to the performance of any act authorized by this act, nor shall any such act be subject to referendum.
Section 14. - Termination.
So long as a district has no debt outstanding, the board of a district may terminate and dissolve the district as of a certain date, and on such date all property, rights, and obligations of the district shall devolve to the City of Valdosta.
