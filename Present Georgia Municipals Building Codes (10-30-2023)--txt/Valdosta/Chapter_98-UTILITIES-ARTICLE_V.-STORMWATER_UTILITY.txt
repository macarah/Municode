ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER UTILITY

Sec. 98-671. - Purpose.
The city is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, article IX, section II, paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof, and state law, to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the incorporated areas of the city, which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the city. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The city council has determined that development in the city to date, and the outlook for continued development at an increasing rate in the future, has created and will continue to create a need for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city. The city has engaged a consultant to perform professional engineering and financial analysis of the city's stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to the city for dealing with stormwater management, and has received, reviewed and considered the results of the consultant's analyses which identify stormwater management needs, propose strategic program goals and priorities, estimate the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, examine reasonable charges by the city for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within the city to support such costs. The city council finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services, systems and facilities within certain more developed portions of the city. The city council finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that a fair and equitable rate structure for those receiving the benefits of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the proceeds of which will be dedicated to the city stormwater utility for carrying out its purposes, will be essential if the city is to provide the level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of the city.
(Ord. No. 2006-18, ยง 5-5001, 3-9-2006)
Sec. 98-672. - Findings.
The city council makes the following findings of fact:
(1)
The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the city assesses and defines the stormwater management issues, needs, goals, program priorities and operational opportunities of the city.
(2)
Given the issues, needs, goals, priorities and operational opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of an accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the city in concert with water resource management programs.
(3)
The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provisions of stormwater management services, systems and facilities and regulation of the use therefore renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city, and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses.
(4)
The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the longterm demands the properties owned impose on the city's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof.
(5)
The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed, and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems, and facilities.
(6)
A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the city through stormwater service charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city.
(7)
A schedule of stormwater utility service charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the city. Such service charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the city council.
(8)
The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city engineer. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the stormwater contribution from the property benefited by such systems.
(9)
The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge.
(10)
It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

The stormwater service charge credit for privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site stormwater control systems, facilities or assets that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property may be up to 50 percent of the stormwater service charge applicable to the property, and shall be proportional to the extent that such stormwater control systems, facilities or assets provided, operated and maintained by private persons may reduce or mitigate the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities. The credit for services and activities that reduce or mitigate the city stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities shall be proportional to the reduced costs realized by the city stormwater utility, but shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the person providing such services and activities, and shall not exceed 50 percent of the stormwater service charge applicable to the subject property.
(e)
In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city engineer on forms provided by the city engineer for such purpose. When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the city engineer, he shall issue a decision granting the credit in whole or in part, or denying the credit within 30 days thereafter. Credits applied for by the property owner in the year 2006, and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater service charges accruing in the year 2006. Beginning January 1, 2007 credits applied for by the property owner, and granted in whole or in part, shall apply from the first day of the calendar month immediately following the date on which a complete application for the credit has been filed with the city.
(f)
A property owner shall not have to reapply annually for the credit granted, but the city engineer may review the credit, and the basis therefore, no more frequently than annually, and may terminate the credit if he finds grounds therefore. If such credit is terminated, the property owner may appeal such determination pursuant to section 98-684, or may, if possible, correct the deficiencies which caused the termination and reapply for the credit. A property owner with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, however, must submit the report prescribed in the NPDES permit to the city engineer to continue to receive the credit from the city associated with the NPDES permit.

Sec. 98-683. - Service charge billing, delinquencies, and collections.
Stormwater service charges shall begin to accrue June 1, 2006, and shall be billed in arrears. A bill for stormwater service charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater service charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. The stormwater service charge may be billed and collected separately or along with water and sanitary sewer charges as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. Frequency of the billing of stormwater service charges shall be monthly unless otherwise specified by the city council. Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land subject to stormwater service charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater service charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater service charge payments. If a property owner is underbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed land, the city stormwater utility may backbill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest for any delinquency during the backbilled period. The city council shall, by resolution adopted from time to time, establish the policies and procedures to be followed by the city stormwater utility in handling and collecting unpaid past due accounts for the stormwater service charge. Such policies and procedures may cover, among other things, late payment fees, fees for returned checks and any other matters the city council, in its discretion, determines would be appropriate for the handling of unpaid past due accounts.

Despite a property owner's contention that the provisions of this article have been applied in error, filing an appeal under this section shall not relieve the property owner from paying all accrued or accruing stormwater services fees and charges. Said payment is a condition precedent for the appeal and failure to pay said charges during the appeal process could result in termination of all utility services provided by the City of Valdosta to the property or property owner. Upon finding that the provisions of this article have been applied in error, the city shall reimburse said property owner for the amounts determined to be charged in error or shall provide credits against future utility fees incurred by the property or property owner.
