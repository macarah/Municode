SECTION I. - ENACTMENT CLAUSE AND SHORT TITLE

Enactment Clause.
This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by the Airport Zoning Act, 1946 Ga. Laws, pp. 121—130. It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the Valdosta Municipal Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, and also if the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the Valdosta Municipal Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared:
1)
That the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Valdosta Municipal Airport;
2)
That it is necessary in the interest of the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and
3)
That the prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation.
It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.
The Mayor and Council of the City of Valdosta hereby ordains and enacts into law the following sections:
Short Title.
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as "Valdosta Municipal Airport Hazard Zoning Ordinance."

Person. An individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association, or governmental entity. It includes a trustee, receiver, assignee, or similar representative of any of them.
9)
Board of Adjustment. A board consisting of five members appointed by the Mayor and Council of the City of Valdosta as provided in section IX of this ordinance.
10)
Runway. A defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length.
11)
Visual Runway. A runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures.
12)
Utility Runway. A runway that is constructed for and intended to be used by propeller-driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and less.
13)
Non-Precision Instrument Runway. A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in non-precision instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned.
14)
Precision Instrument Runway. A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an instrument landing system (ILS) or a precision approach radar (PAR). It also means a runway for which a precision approach system is planned and is so indicated on an approved airport layout plan, or any other planning document.
15)
Primary Surface. A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; but when the runway has no specially prepared hard surface, or planned hard surface, the primary surface ends at each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface is set forth in section III of this ordinance. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline.
16)
Approach, Transitional, Horizontal, and Conical Zones. These zones are set forth in section III of this ordinance.
17)
Horizontal Surface. A horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincides with the perimeter of the horizontal zone.
18)
Transitional Surfaces. These surfaces extend outward at 90-degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical surfaces. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surfaces, which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at 90 degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
SECTION III. - AIRPORT ZONES
In order to carry out the provisions of this ordinance, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Valdosta Municipal Airport. Such zones are shown on the Valdosta Municipal Airport Hazard Zoning Map, prepared by the Valdosta-Lowndes County Planning Commission, and dated September 6, 1978, which is attached to this ordinance and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
1)
Runway Larger than Utility With a Visibility Minimum Greater than Three-Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
2)
Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
3)
Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are hereby established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces.
4)
Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is hereby established by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
5)
Conical Zone. The conical zone is hereby established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
SECTION IV. - AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS
Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or be maintained in any zone created by this ordinance to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows:
1)
Runway Larger than Utility With a Visibility Minimum Greater than Three-Fourths Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes upward 34 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
2)
Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. Slopes upward 50 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward 40 feet horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway centerline.
3)
Transitional Zones. Slopes upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach zones, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 202.00 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach zones, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, height limits sloping upward and outward seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically shall be maintained beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as precision instrument runway approach surface, and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90-degree angles to the extended runway centerline.
4)
Horizontal Zone. One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation or a height of 352.00 feet above mean sea level.
5)
Conical Zone. Slope upward and outward 20 feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
6)
Expected Height Limitations. Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction, or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to 35 feet above the surface of the land.
Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail.
SECTION V. - USE RESTRICTIONS
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this ordinance in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
SECTION VI. - NONCONFORMING USES
1)
Regulations not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and is diligently prosecuted.
2)
Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport manager to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City of Valdosta.
SECTION VII. - PERMITS
1)
Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in a., b. and c. hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with Section VII, 4.
a)
In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
b)
In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones.
c)
In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this ordinance except as set forth in section IV, 6.
2)
Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted.
3)
Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
4)
Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this ordinance may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport manager for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
5)
Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the City of Valdosta, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
SECTION VIII. - ENFORCEMENT
It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for permits and variances shall be made to the zoning administrator upon a form furnished by him. Applications required by this ordinance to be submitted to the zoning administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied by him. Application for action by the board of adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted by the zoning administrator.
