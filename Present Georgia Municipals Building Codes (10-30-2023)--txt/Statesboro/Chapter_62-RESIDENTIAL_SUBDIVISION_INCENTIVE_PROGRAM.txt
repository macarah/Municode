ARTICLE I. - GENERAL

Sec. 62-1. - Purpose.
In order to encourage the development of owner-occupied, single-family residential subdivisions inside the corporate limits, the city may provide incentives to developers for property meeting the following criteria, subject to the availability of funding and the competitiveness of application score.
(Ord. No. 2020-15, 12-15-20)
Sec. 62-2. - General qualifying program criteria.
(a)
The property must either be within the city limits, or pre-annexed into the city prior to any sketch plan or preliminary platting so that the property is fully developed under the city's subdivision ordinance, zoning ordinance, and other land use regulatory ordinances. Property outside the city must meet the requirements for annexation under Georgia statutes, so that the property is clearly within the city limits before any incentives can be contracted for or received.
(b)
The property must be reasonably close to existing water and sewer lines such that the city can economically extend the main lines to the subdivision. Such determination shall be made at the discretion of the city.
(c)
The developer must enter into a written development agreement with the city, in a form acceptable to the city attorney, delineating the developer's and city's respective responsibilities for the various components of development. This agreement must be approved by the city council before commencement of development.
(e)
The subdivision must be developed in reasonably-sized phases so as not to place a financial strain on either the developer or the city.
(f)
Consideration will be given to the city's relative cost per lot to fund the incentive program, including the cost to extend the major water and sewer lines to the property, minus any capital cost recovery fees or similar reimbursement programs designed to offset some of these costs to the city.
(g)
As part of this evaluation, the city reserves the right not to incentivize any portion of a residential subdivision that is considerably more expensive to provide infrastructure to than the remainder of the subdivision, due to geographic or other conditions.
(h)
Property must be zoned R-20, R-15, or PUD (but only for single-family residential development) to qualify.
(i)
Develop the subdivision using underground electric, underground telephone/internet/cable television fiber optic utilities, natural gas utilities at each home, curb and gutter, sidewalk on at least one side of each street, and decorative street lights and poles.
(j)
A homeowner's association with subdivision covenants, acceptable to the city, must be recorded (prior to building permit issuance). It is the intent that said association will provide oversight of development standards and maintenance of common areas. Covenants must require:
(1)
Brick or masonry veneer;
(2)
Minimum two car garage;
(3)
Landscaping including trees on home sites;
(4)
Architectural shingles or standing seam metal roofs;;
(5)
Concrete driveways;
(6)
The prohibition of all unit rentals for a minimum of one year and thereafter, any rentals will be for a minimum of one year. This one-year period will commence upon the city's acceptance of the roads; and
(7)
Natural gas plumbing must be installed within the home to accommodate service provisions to, as a minimum, the cooking stove, water heater(s), and fireplace(s).
(Ord. No. 2020-15, 12-15-20)
Sec. 62-3. - Specific criteria.
In addition to meeting the general qualifying program criteria listed above in section 62-2, an applicant may enhance the application's scoring competitiveness by including any of the specific criteria as listed below. The city's development review team, comprised of the assistant city manager, director of public works and engineering, planning and development director and the public utilities director will evaluate the scores for all submissions as per the criteria listed in this section.

In the R-20, and R-15 zoning districts, and provisionally, the PUD zoning district, applicant should provide evidence that the proposal will:
a.
Have proximity to schools, public parks and/or other like public facilities.
      (up to) _______ 15 _______ pts
b.
Provide architectural design and high-end amenities that surpass minimum standards so that the aesthetic design and building materials exceed the housing product currently prevalent within the city and surrounding county. Samples of building facades must be provided with this application. (No housing unit clad in either vinyl or aluminum siding will be considered, vinyl or aluminum trim is acceptable). Additionally, delineate the relative quality of the proposed housing expressed as follows:
1.
The minimum square footage of heated space;
2.
The minimum dimensions of the garage space;
3.
The number and quality of additional home amenities to be provided in order to improve the subdivision's value and marketability, including the submission of a professionally designed landscape plan.
      (up to) _______ 25 _______ pts
c.
Contribute to the desirability of the proposed location, considering surrounding developments and zoning of undeveloped property.
      (up to) _______ 5 _______ pts

      (up to) _______ 15 _______ pts
e.
Utilize property zoned (or intended to re-zone) to the PUD zoning district, but only if used exclusively for single-family residential developments at a density per acre not exceeding the respective R-20 or R-15 zoning designation. The intent of this provision is to allow developers flexibility in developing cluster housing on smaller lots (also referred to as a conservation subdivision) with a corresponding increase in open space in common ownership maintained by a homeowners' association. Developers will need to provide a "yield plan" showing a comparable amount of density to the respective zoning district.
      (up to) _______ 5 _______ pts
f.
Provide an additional percentage of useable open space and recreation facilities for the use of residents within the proposed subdivision.

      (up to) _______ 25 _______ pts
g.
