Section 1500. - Preamble.
The mayor and city council of Statesboro have determined that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city that a comprehensive and balanced system of control and regulation be enacted as to the placement, maintenance and removal of signs within the limits of the city, said determination having been derived from, but not limited to the following concerns:
A.
The safe and efficient flow of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic through the city which may otherwise be impeded by the indiscriminate proliferation of signage erected to attract the attention of the traveling public, and which if left unregulated, may result in hazards to travelers through the erection of increased numbers of larger, brighter or more distracting signs by owners attempting to convey competing messages;
B.
The protection of property values, both public and private, by assuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses while balancing the community's variant interests of enhancing the commercial and economic atmosphere of the city with the desire to maintain a tranquil aesthetic environment that eliminates visual clutter and blight through the management of hardscape features, including signage;
C.
The interference with the ability of property owners to enjoy or use their property without undue visual obstruction, distraction or hazard;
D.
The preservation and protection of properties and areas having historic, recreational, educational, cultural, religious values and environments, and prominent community gateways and major thoroughfares which, through orderly design and maintenance of the built environment—Including signage, provide for community pride and exhibit clear community expectations that promote investment through a predictable development pattern;
E.
The elimination of potential hazards arising during times of inclement weather or other natural disaster;
F.
The provision of some signage that has the targeted purpose of promoting public safety, but for which the identification of such signage by description is difficult without referring to its incidental function; such as, address numerals or subdivision or major development entrance signage; which, is a tool for enabling the traveling public and emergency personnel to locate point of ingress and egress during visitation or emergency call response. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners;
G.
The control of the proliferation and placement of signs in an indiscriminate manner so as to pose a threat to the aesthetic and environmental values and qualities of life within the City of Statesboro;
H.
Increasingly vibrant and distracting signs, including those incorporating LED and similar technology cause unique and substantial hazards to traffic caused by a higher level of distractability, are inconsistent with the standards established for major community thoroughfares and gateways, and demand greater diligence and resources in enforcing proper use and display than those signs not incorporating such technology; and,
I.
In addition to the other concerns stated within this section, specific districts, thoroughfares and gateways throughout the community, due to traffic volumes, population density, proximity to major community facilities, or other similar factors, may — absent the provision of reasonable land management regulations — be more susceptible to the proliferation of signage, banners and other similar displays than other parts of the city; but, have otherwise been determined by the community to be of significant importance in maintaining an orderly, moderated and consistent development pattern and a community character free of visual clutter including, but not limited to the following:
i.
Veterans Memorial Highway. The city's principal by-way alternatively serves as a community greenway, providing for areas of natural landscape; and, where flanked by development, a soft transition between the natural and built environment. With few direct vehicular access points to adjacent property, abutting properties will remain rural or develop in a residential manner. Signs on this thoroughfare must remain limited in number and scale to avoid the inadvertent placement of signage in proximity to the city's neighborhoods and greenspaces that would not otherwise be permitted in residential areas and on residential streets. The allowance for unregulated signage will further reduce the highway's function as a community parkway, contradicting the community interest of providing for an orderly visual environment.
ii.
Urban Core. The city of Statesboro's historic downtown and central business district, and surrounding properties extending north to Parrish Street and south to Georgia Southern University are located in the Urban Core Character Area as identified in the Statesboro Comprehensive Plan (2009-19). The Urban Core Character Area will redevelop with an urban characteristic that emphasizes buildings, streets, and streetscape transition between these elements, in a manner that is human in scale and focuses on pedestrian orientation — effectively serving as an extension of the traditional downtown development pattern. Signage in the Urban Core must be of a size and scale that works in harmony with preferred building patterns that promote pedestrian activity. Large, bright and signage of excessive size contradicts the desired development pattern of the urban core and makes mixed-use urban development patterns more difficult to implement over time by conflicting with limited development space and resulting in open expanses of property that are undesirable or unsafe for pedestrian activity.
iii.
South Main Street and Fair Road (Urban Core Character Area to Veteran's Memorial Parkway). These thoroughfares serve as principal gateways into the city of Statesboro, and provide direct access to facilities of regional and statewide importance including Georgia Southern University and East Georgia Regional Medical Center. Signs shall be encouraged that are creative and well-designed and that contribute in a positive way to the city's visual environment, express local character, and help develop a distinctive image for the city. Signs permitted to be placed in a haphazard manner and at a large scale, compete with adjacent buildings and properties for attention and lessen the importance of community institutions. Excessive amounts of signage will damage the community's "sense of place" and subsequently place the city of Statesboro at a disadvantage when competing for investment with communities that regulate their built environments in a more progressive manner.
iv.
East Main Street (Central Business District to Municipal Limits). The eastern gateway into downtown Statesboro provides a soft transition from rural land uses into concentrated residential areas of varying density with limited supporting commercial services and substantial community open spaces including Mill Creek Regional Park. Emphasis along this thoroughfare should be placed on mixing substantial amounts of natural and manicured landscaping that provide increased value to residential areas. Signage of excessive size and scale directly conflicts with the passiveness of surrounding architecture, natural settings, and low to moderate density residential land uses, and will devalue adjacent residential property. Signs must be of smaller scale to reflect the neighborhood atmosphere of the area, and the local nature of supporting businesses, services and public facilities.

A.
Applications. All applications for sign permits of any kind shall be submitted to the zoning administrator on an application form prescribed by the city. The applicant must be the property owner or the lessee of the lot on which the sign will be located, or an agent or representative of the property owner or the lessee.
B.

An application for construction, creation, or installation of a new sign or for modification of an existing sign shall be accompanied by a detailed illustration of the dimensions, design, structure, and location of each sign in the format prescribed within the official application form. Each sign on the same lot shall be subject to a separate application and corresponding fee.
C.
Action. Within 15 business days of the submission of an application for a sign permit, including required and accompanying materials as provided in section 1503 B. of this ordinance [article], the zoning administrator shall either:
1.
Issue the permit where it is found that such sign application is complete and the proposed sign adheres to the standards of this article and other applicable requirements of city ordinances and state law; or
2.
Deny the permit where the application is incomplete, contains false material statements or where the proposed sign would violate standards of this ordinance or other ordinances or state laws regulating signage. Any denial of a permit shall be in writing and shall include a specification of the section(s) of the ordinance, or applicable provision of other city ordinances or state laws with which the sign is inconsistent. The denial shall be based upon and shall cite to the specific articulated standards in this ordinance [article], or other law, and shall not be based or cited to the general concerns contained in section 1500 herein. A denied application later resubmitted in conformity with this ordinance shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, rather than on the date of original submission. A decision to deny a permit shall be in writing and shall be served on the permit applicant either by hand delivery or by first class mail to the address provided by the applicant no later than 15 business days after initial receipt of the application.
D.
Inspection. The zoning administrator shall inspect the lot for which each permit for a new sign or for modification of an existing sign is issued, sixth months after issuance of such permit or at such earlier date as the owner may request. If the construction is not substantially complete at the time of inspection, the permit shall lapse and become void. If the construction is complete and in full compliance with this ordinance [article] and other applicable codes, the zoning administrator shall affix to the premises a permanent symbol identifying the sign(s) and the applicable permit by number. If the construction is substantially complete, but not in full compliance with this ordinance [article] and applicable codes, the zoning administrator shall give the owner or applicant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days from the date of such inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the permit shall lapse. If construction is then complete, a permanent symbol shall be affixed described above.
E.
Appeals of permit denial. In the event of denial of an application for a permit, the applicant may appeal the decision to the mayor and city council within ten business days of the hand delivery or mailing of such denial. The applicant shall make written notice of appeal to the city manager, who shall schedule the hearing before the mayor and city council at the next council meeting occurring at least seven days after such notice is received. At the appeals hearing, the sole issues are whether the permit application is complete and free from false material statements and whether the proposed sign complies with the standards of this ordinance and other ordinances and state laws regulating the proposed sign. Where the mayor and council find the application to be complete and true and that the proposed sign would comply with all terms of governing law, the permit shall be issued. The mayor and council shall make its decision no later than 30 days after the date of hearing and a written copy of that decision, with supporting reasons shall be transmitted to the applicant in the same manner as the initial decision of the city.
F.
Revocation. In the event it is determined that a permit was issued in violation of this ordinance or other ordinance or law regulating the sign at issue or where the sign has been erected in violation of such standards, the zoning administrator shall issue a written notice of revocation of the permit, stating the grounds for such revocation action. The notice of revocation shall be in the same form as notices of denial and delivered to the permit holder in the same manner as a notice of denial. Where no appeal is taken within ten business days of giving notice, the revocation shall be considered final. Within ten business days of receipt of a notice of revocation, a permit holder may appeal the notice by filing a written notice of revocation with the city manager in the same form as appeals of a notice of denial. Hearing on an appeal of revocation shall be conducted within the same time frames and the same manner as appeals of denial.
G.
Variances. No variances shall be permitted from the terms of this article. Specifically, no variances under article XVIII of this ordinance [chapter] shall be applicable to the standards contained within this article.
H.
Work without permit issuance. If any person, owner, authorized agent or contractor commences any work before securing permits required by this ordinance [article], fees upon application shall be doubled. Such fees shall be in addition to any other remedy resulting from enforcement of this article as provided by section 1515.
I.
Multiple lots. If several lots of record which are contiguous and adjacent have been combined for a single purpose, then the lots shall be considered as a single lot in determining the size, height and use requirements as set forth by this ordinance.

B.
Assignment of sign permits. A current and valid sign permit shall be freely assignable to a successor as owner of the property or holder of a business license for the same premises, subject to any filing of such applications as the zoning administrator may require; no fees shall be charged for filing an assignment with the city. The assignment shall not require city approval. However, a modification of the sign by an assignee shall require a permit and payment of fee as for a new sign.

Dimensional standards by sign district. Signs may be erected in those districts where the applicable sign type is allowed as provided within the Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 contained in this section. The following principles shall control when computing the sign area, height and other miscellaneous provisions provided in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6:
1.
Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face shall be calculated by means of the smallest shape (i.e., square, circle, rectangle) that surrounds the extreme limits of writing or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework.
2.
Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The area of a sign with more than one face shall be calculated by totaling the areas of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two faces are identical and back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, the sign shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
3.
Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be calculated as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign.
4.
Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a lot. The permitted total of the area of all individual signs on a zone lot shall be computed by applying the formula from Tables 3, 4, 5 or 6, to the lot or building frontage, or wall area, for the zoning district in which the lot is located. If a lot fronts on two or more streets, it is allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage.

(Ord. No. 2009-05, § 1, 6-16-09)
Section 1513. - Existing and nonconforming signs.
A.
Existing signs. Signs existing and in place at the time of enactment of this ordinance [article] which were legal at the time of erection but are not in compliance with the requirements hereof are nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs existing as of June 16, 2009, shall be exempt from fees or the requirement to apply for a permit. However, the use of any temporary or portable sign existing at the time of passage of this ordinance shall be continued or considered a nonconforming sign and not subject to the provisions of this section only for 90 days, but shall not be continued or considered a nonconforming use thereafter and shall be removed. The bolting down of signs by their construction and nature designed to be temporary shall not henceforth qualify a sign for consideration as a nonconforming sign. Any person who had a portable changeable copy sign in place on their premises at the time of enactment of this sign ordinance and which must be removed within 90 days of enactment of this ordinance, shall have a grace period of 18 months from enactment of this ordinance in which they may add a changeable copy sign as part of a significant structural alteration to an existing sign without the existing sign losing its status as a nonconforming and existing sign in the event the addition causes the existing sign to exceed the height and size restrictions of this ordinance.
B.
Nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs once removed may not be replaced by signs that do not comply with the requirements of this ordinance [article]. Nonconforming signs may not be renovated in such a manner that significantly alters the nature of the sign and said sign remains in noncompliance with the requirements of this ordinance [article] following renovation. The replacement of panels which do not alter the structural composition of the signs shall not be considered a renovation that results in loss of nonconforming status, except that nothing within this provision shall infer that panel replacement may allow for an increase, change or alteration in the nonconforming characteristics of a sign, or allow for the use of replacement panels that are otherwise prohibited by this article.
C.
Maintenance of nonconforming signs. Nonconforming signs shall be kept in the same manner of maintenance and repair as specified for conforming signs in section 1512 of this ordinance [article].
D.
Change of status of owner. Replacements of or changes to a sign resulting from a change in status of the owner or lessee of premises served by a nonconforming sign subsequent to the adoption of this section shall negate the protections afforded nonconforming status and the sign shall be removed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance [article], with the following exception: The replacement of panels or other alterations to a nonconforming sign which reflect a change in the message but which do not involve a change in the basic structure or major structural components of the sign, nor which increase the height and/or square footage of the sign, shall not result in loss of status as a nonconforming use.
E.
Unsafe nonconforming sign. Any nonconforming sign determined to be unsafe by the zoning administrator shall be removed or rendered safe and brought into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance [article].
F.
Damaged nonconforming sign. Signs becoming damaged or dilapidated as a result of the passage of time may not be repaired and shall be removed. Nonconforming signs damaged by Act of God may be repaired by the owner of the sign. To the extent such a sign can be brought into conformance with the ordinance at the time of repair, the owner will be required to do so. If a nonconforming sign damaged or destroyed by Act of God cannot be brought into compliance, then the owner may be allowed to repair the nonconforming sign, but no such repair shall be considered to extend the natural life of the sign prior to its becoming damaged by the Act of God.
G.
Conforming and nonconforming signs. No conforming sign or advertising device shall be erected on the business premises of a sign permit holder or applicant if the permit holder or applicant maintains an existing nonconforming sign on the business premises of the sign permit holder or applicant until the nonconforming sign has been removed.
H.
Incentives for nonconforming signs. In the event a nonconforming sign is removed and replaced with a sign in conformance with this ordinance [article], the owner of the property on which the sign is placed shall be allowed a waiver of all charges due under this ordinance [article] up to the amount equal to the costs of removal of the nonconforming sign and erection of a conforming sign. In order to qualify for the waiver, proof of costs must be presented to the zoning administrator and shall not exceed the fair market value of such costs, as determined by inquiry of the zoning administrator.

Section 1514. - Violations.
Any of the following shall be a violation of this ordinance [article] and shall be subject to the enforcement remedies and penalties provided by this ordinance [article], by the zoning ordinance [this appendix], and by state law:
A.
To install, create, erect, or maintain any sign in a way that is inconsistent with any plan or permit governing such sign or the lot on which the sign is located;
B.
To install, create, erect, or maintain any sign requiring a permit without such a permit;
C.
To fail to remove any sign that is installed, created, erected, or maintained in violation of this ordinance [article], for which the sign permit has lapsed;
D.
To continue any such violation. Each such day of a continued violation shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalty portions of this ordinance [article];
E.
Each sign installed, created, erected, or maintained in violation of this ordinance [article] shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalty portions of this ordinance [article];
F.
It shall further be a violation of this ordinance [article] to paste, print, nail, tack or otherwise fasten any card, banner, handbill, sign, poster or advertisement or notice of any kind, or cause the same to be done, on any private property without the consent of the owner of such property. No person shall construct, erect, operate, use or maintain any sign without the written permission of the owner or other person in lawful possession or control of the property on which such structure or sign is located.
(Ord. No. 2009-05, § 1, 6-16-09)
Section 1515. - Enforcement and remedies.
All enforcement and remedies contained in article XIX of the zoning ordinance [this appendix] apply to this section. In addition, the following provisions shall apply:
A.
The zoning administrator shall cause to be removed any sign that endangers the public safety, such as an abandoned, dangerous, or materially electrical or structurally defective sign or a sign for which no permit has been issued when required or which is otherwise in violation of this ordinance [article]. The zoning administrator shall prepare a written citation that shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved and that shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within ten days or such further time as is reasonable under the circumstances in the determination of the zoning administrator, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section; provided that, where a sign poses an imminent danger to the life or health of members of the public, the zoning administrator may cause the sign to be secured or removed without first affecting such notice and shall provide notice after the fact to the owner of the property and owner of the sign.
B.
All notices by the zoning administrator shall be personally served or sent by first class mail. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date received, if hand delivered, or three days after the date mailed.
C.
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign, and the occupant of the property. If any such persons are unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such persons' last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises.
D.
Any person having an interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the zoning administrator ordering removal or compliance by filing written notice of appeal with the city administrator within ten business days after receipt of the notice. Appeals will be provided in the manner set forth in section 1503 F. of this ordinance [article].
E.
Any sign removed by the zoning administrator pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses incurred by the city in connection with the sign's removal. In the event it is practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, the city administrator may do so at public or private sale at the best price obtainable; the city shall keep an account of the proceeds. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the costs of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Any proceeds in excess of the cost of removal shall be returned to the sign owner, if known, or, if unknown, shall be deposited in the city treasury and maintained for a period of three years. At the end of the three years, all unclaimed proceeds shall become property of the city. Where the proceeds derived from such sale are less than the cost of the removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located, such lien to be collectible in the same manner as city property taxes.
F.
Any sign erected in violation of this ordinance [article] may be removed from public property or right-of-way by duly authorized employees of the city and the responsible party may be cited for such violation.
