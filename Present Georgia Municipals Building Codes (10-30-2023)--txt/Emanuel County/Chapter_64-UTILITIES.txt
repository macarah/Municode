(1)
Septage and/or bulk sewage sludge shall be injected below the surface of the land and no significant amount of septage and/or bulk sewage sludge shall be present on the land surface within one hour after injection. Injection may be accomplished by any device(s) that places the septage and/or bulk sewage sludge beneath the solid surface in a narrow trench at a depth of no greater than 12 inches, and a minimum trench depth of four inches, and promptly replaces the cover soil in the same action of trenching and depositing septage and/or bulk sewage sludge. Excavation of a trench followed by placement of septage and/or bulk sewage sludge and later covering of the trench is not considered injection and is prohibited.
(2)
Subsurface application techniques include plow furrow cover (PFC), subsurface injection (SSI), and terregator injection, which is a patented device for subsurface injection. Placement in trenches and lagoons are considered burial practices and are not approved. An approved storage facility is required. A resting period of one week is required before equipment can be driven over waste-injected land.
(c)
Lime treatment. In order to diminish pathogens and minimize vector attraction, the pH of septage and/or bulk sewage sludge to be subsurface injected into the soil shall be raised to 12 or higher by lime addition and, without the addition of more lime, shall remain at 12 or higher for two hours prior to subsurface injection.

(c)
Upon issuance of a license, and after the land application of septage and/or bulk sewage sludge or septage has commenced, the county board of commissioners, or its designee, shall conduct, at a minimum, quarterly inspections of the site to monitor compliance with this article including, without limitation, to determine whether the septage and/or bulk sewage sludge is being properly applied, whether all Environmental Protection Agency and local permit and/or license requirements have been achieved, whether cumulative ceiling concentrations of metals section 64-42(f) are exceeded, whether setbacks are being observed, whether all vector and pathogen abatement requirements are being followed, and whether there is compliance with food and feed crop restrictions under this article and all other pertinent authority. The cost of such quarterly inspection shall be the sole responsibility of the licensee.
(d)
Upon issuance of a license and after the land application of septage and/or bulk sewage sludge or septage has commenced, the county board of commissioners, or its designee, shall, as often as it deems necessary to protect and ensure public health, collect samples of the septage and/or bulk sewage sludge in the holding tanks to determine compliance with the pathogen and vector abatement requirements of this article. The results of such tests shall be maintained by the county board of commissioners and shall be provided to the license holder upon request. The cost of such sampling and testing shall be the sole responsibility of the licensee.
(e)
Upon issuance of a license and after the land application of bulk sewage sludge or septage has commenced, the county board of commissioners, or its designee, shall, as often as it deems necessary to protect and ensure the public health, collect water samples from all water impoundments, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, marshes, sinkholes, or any permanent or intermittent water bodies considered a water of the state on, or within one-half mile of the site in order to test for chemicals, metals, pathogens, radioactive material, and other pollutants. The results of such tests shall be maintained by the county board of commissioners and shall be provided to the license holder upon request.
(1)
If such testing reveals the presence of chemicals, metals, pathogens, radioactive material, and/or other pollutants in excess of concentrations permitted by pertinent local, state or federal regulations or guidelines, and if the origin of such pollutants is determined to be the land application site, then a violation of this article will have occurred and the county board of commissioners, in addition to any other remedies provided under this article, shall be authorized to immediately petition the superior court of the county for issuance of a stop work order effective against the licensee until such time as the pollutant concentration levels in the affected water bodies are reduced to permissible levels and remedial action is undertaken by the licensee to ensure no future contamination.
(f)
The inspections and monitoring required in this section are in addition to those tests and inspections required to be performed by, or on behalf, of the holder. Cost of such inspections and monitoring shall be borne by the permittee.
(g)
Representatives of the county board of commissioners, or its designee, may inspect the site without notice or a search warrant to monitor compliance with this article. Prior to conducting any inspection under this article, the person conducting the inspection on behalf of the board shall present his/her credentials to the owner or occupier of the site unless this requirement would wholly or partially frustrate the inspection.

ARTICLE IV. - SOLAR FARMS

Sec. 64-80. - Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the licensure, installation, operation, and maintenance of solar farms to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Emanuel County.
( Ord. of 08-15-2022(1) )
Sec. 64-81. - Application to solar farms.
This article shall apply to all solar farms or photovoltaic solar energy production facilities located in the unincorporated areas of the county, which shall hereafter collectively be referred to as "solar farms."
( Ord. of 08-15-2022(1) )
Sec. 64-82. - Standards for solar farms.
All solar farms in the unincorporated areas of the county shall comply with the following standards:
(a)
Reserved.
(b)
Solar farms shall be fenced in using a chain link fence with a height of at least six feet with anti-climb devices with three barbed wire line arms or otherwise acceptable to the county code enforcement department. Brightly colored signs no smaller than one foot by two feet shall be posted on the fence every 100 feet warning of danger and high voltage.
(c)
Abutting residential properties shall be visually screened year round from any solar farms to the reasonable satisfaction of the county code enforcement department through any one or a combination of planting or existing vegetation or fencing, all of which shall be at least six feet in height.
(d)
Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that which is necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the ground mounted solar photovoltaic installation and consistent with best practices for the preservation of natural areas or good husbandry of the land or forest.
(e)
The height of any vegetation within ten feet of any solar panels or equipment shall not exceed 18 inches and shall be no less than two inches in height over the soil surface. Any disturbed land shall be stabilized by a permanent seeding of perennial vegetation such as grass or other dense surface cover that will protect the soil surface from erosion, prevent sediment and runoff at the site from reaching downstream areas, and enhance the aesthetics of the site. It is recommended that a slow-growing, vegetative cover be utilized so that general maintenance of the growth can be kept to a minimum.
(f)
The names of the manufacturers, installers, facility owners, and facility operators, and their addresses and phone numbers, shall be posted on the required fencing at each entrance of a solar farm.
(g)
All electrical interconnection and distribution lines within a solar farm's boundaries, except for power lines that leave the project or are within the substation, shall be underground, unless the county code enforcement department grants a written exception due to severe environmental constraints.
(h)
Lighting of a solar farm and its accessory structures shall be limited to the minimum reasonably necessary for its safe operation and shall be reasonably shielded from abutting properties. Where feasible, lighting of a solar farm shall be directed downward and shall incorporate full cutoff fixtures to reduce light pollution.
(i)
All solar farms shall comply with any other applicable requirements of the county code of ordinances and zoning requirements, including, but not limited to, setback and height requirements. No solar farm shall be located any closer than 100 feet of any residential dwelling, public road, right-of-way, or property of an adjoining landowner.
(j)
All solar farms shall have a knox box entry system at the primary entrance. The knox box entry system shall comply with the specifications of the International Fire Code.
(k)
All solar farms shall have a written emergency response plan that shall be approved by the county's code enforcement department, sheriff's office, fire department, and emergency management agency. Each solar farm shall update its emergency response plan no later than January 1 of each year with a copy provided to all departments and agencies named in this subsection. The emergency response plan shall include the following:
(1)
The phone number, email address, and street address for all manufacturers, installers, owners, and operators; and
(2)
The phone number, email address, and mailing address for a representative of the solar farm responsible for responding to public inquiries; and
(3)
The material safety data sheets that apply to any materials on the solar farm; and
(4)
The clearly marked means and instructions for shutting down the solar photovoltaic installation.
(l)
Any solar farm that has not been in use for a period of 180 consecutive days for its original purpose as approved by the county code enforcement department shall be deemed abandoned and shall not be authorized to recommence operations until a new application and inspection have been completed.
(m)
The owners and operators of a solar farm and the owners of any real property on which it is located shall be jointly responsible for the removal of the solar energy system, its equipment and panels, and any appurtenant structures and for restoration of the site to as natural a condition as reasonably possible, all of which must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the Emanuel County Code Enforcement Department no later than 90 days after abandonment, closure, or if the solar farm is not operating in "substantial compliance" with the standards set forth in the approved application. No later than 120 days after abandonment, closure, or failure to be in substantial compliance, the owners or operators of any such solar farm shall provide written documentation acceptable to the Emanuel County Code Enforcement Department demonstrating that the solar panels and related equipment were properly disposed of in accordance with federal, state, and local laws. In addition to all other available legal remedies, including calling the bond required per section 64-83(d), if the entire solar energy system has not been removed within 90 days after abandonment, closure, or failure to be in substantial compliance, Emanuel County may remove the solar energy system, its equipment, panels, and any appurtenant structures, and may place a lien for the costs of removal upon the real property on which the solar farm was located. Prior to removing the solar energy system, Emanuel County shall provide ten days' written notice to the owners and operators of the solar farm listed in the emergency response plan required pursuant to subsection (k) of this section and the owners of the real property on which the solar farm is located. Said notice shall be provided by personal delivery or certified mail to the last address reasonably known and shall be posted on the property. Any delay by the county in taking action pursuant to this subsection shall not in any manner waive the county's right to take such action.
(n)
The county code enforcement department may, in its reasonable discretion, waive any of the above-listed conditions which are not reasonable in light of the nature of the project and may add additional conditions or safeguards as needed for public health, safety, and welfare or to mitigate the impact of the solar farm on surrounding properties and uses. Violations of any such additional conditions or safeguards shall be a violation of this article.
(o)
All of the conditions and requirements in this section shall be of a continuing nature.
