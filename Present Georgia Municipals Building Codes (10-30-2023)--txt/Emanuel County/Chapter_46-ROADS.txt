(Code 1992, § 34-1)
Sec. 46-4. - Paving of county roads.
(a)
Whenever any county road in the county is placed upon the paving priority list and reaches a position on the list such that paving is feasible, a paving contract may be awarded if 51 percent of the adjoining landowners have executed or agreed to execute voluntary conveyances of the necessary right-of-way. Any additional right-of-way needed for paving shall then be acquired by condemnation at the expense of the county.
(b)
In the discretion of the board of commissioners, this policy may also be applied to county roads that are not currently listed on the paving priority list if the board of commissioners determines that right-of-way should be completely acquired prior to inclusion on the list.
(Code 1992, § 34-2)
Sec. 46-5. - Removal and replacement of farm fences by county in connection with road improvement projects.
(a)
The county will remove farm fences and posts for the owner if the fence is located on property which has been voluntarily and without compensation deeded to the county as right-of-way for public road construction or improvement if, in the opinion of the county commissioners or the county road superintendent, the wire or posts are reusable by the property owner.
(b)
The county will further assist the owner in reinstallation of the fence or posts under the same conditions and requirements as outlined in subsection (a) of this section. If the fence is not reusable, the county will assist the owner in refencing the affected property if the owner furnishes the fence and posts.
(Code 1992, § 34-3)
Sec. 46-6. - County road policy.
It is the policy of the county to acquire right-of-way for paving purposes by donation whenever possible. However, if 51 percent of the affected landowners on any road submitted for a paving project agree to donate the needed right-of-way, then the county may obtain the required right-of-way from the nonconsenting landowners by condemnation. In determining if a road is to be submitted for a paving contract, the cost of acquisition, including the cost of right-of-way and condemnation, if necessary, shall be one of the factors considered by the commissioners. Additionally, the board of commissioners retains its inherent power to acquire any right-of-way through condemnation if, in their discretion, the commissioners determine that the right-of-way is necessary for public transportation purposes.
Sec. 46-7. - Enhanced 911 system.
(a)
The county has implemented a county-wide enhanced 911 system. In order for such system to function effectively it is essential that persons driving emergency vehicles be able to quickly ascertain the 911 number of a structure or residence from the roadway. Every structure and/or residence in the county has been assigned a 911 number.
(b)
Within six months from the date of the ordinance from which this section is derived every owner and/or occupier of a structure, residence or other building in the county which has been assigned a 911 number shall have posted as outlined in subsection (c) of this section the number assigned to such structure, residence and/or other building.
(c)
The 911 number shall be attached to the owner/occupier's mailbox, a post or like structure at the corner of the property line which abuts the roadway and driveway or other entrance way which services the such structure, residence and/or building. The numbers shall be no less than three inches in height and shall be located at least two feet above the existing ground level and shall be posted on both sides of the mailbox, post or other structure such that the numbers are visible from either direction on the roadway. They shall also be of a color which contrasts with the background of the numbers and/or the color of the structure to which they are attached. Any cost involved in complying with this section shall be the sole responsibility of the owner/occupier.
(d)
On and after six months from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived any owner/occupier subject thereto found not to be in compliance will be subject to prosecution in the magistrate court of the county for violation of a county ordinance which is a misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of $1,000.00 fine and/or 12 months in the county jail.
(Res. of 2-19-1996)
Sec. 46-8. - Driveway repair policy.
(a)
Driveways which tie in or access county roads are there for the convenience of the owner/occupier of the property which the driveway serves. The repair and maintenance of such a driveway is the responsibility of the owner/occupier using it to access their property. However, there are situations in which the tie-in is actually located on county right-of-way; and if that section of the driveway is allowed to deteriorate, it can adversely affect the adjacent roadway. Under limited circumstances, the county may provide assistance to the owner/occupier in repairing that portion of the driveway only.
(b)
If the tie-in to a private driveway and a county road is entirely upon the county right-of-way; if the driveway was initially installed with the knowledge and permission of the county; if the condition of the tie-in, due to no fault of the owner, is such that it constitutes a danger to the county roadway or adjoining right-of-way, then the county may assist in repair or restoration of the tie-in portion of the driveway by providing and spreading dirt or other fill material on the portion located upon the county right-of-way. In order to adequately accomplish such repair or restoration and protect the county's property, it may be necessary to incidentally spread such material on a small portion of the driveway located on private property. In this instance, the owner's permission will be obtained prior to initiation of any such work. Under no circumstances will county forces go further on private property than is absolutely necessary to complete the restoration required to protect the county's interest.
