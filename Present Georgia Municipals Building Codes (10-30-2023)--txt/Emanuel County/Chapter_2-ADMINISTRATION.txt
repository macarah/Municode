(c)
Any change or addition to space being rented must be approved by the board of commissioners prior to any renovation or acquisition of other space.
(Code 1992, § 2-1)

Sec. 2-2. - Use of county livestock barn.
(a)
The board of commissioners has delegated responsibilities of rental and use of the county livestock facilities to the county administrator. Date and time of rental must be agreeable to the board of commissioners.
(1)
For use by a profit-making group or individual, a fee shall be charged in an amount as provided in the schedule of fees and charges. A deposit in an amount as provided in the schedule of fees and charges must be paid at the time the key and telephone are picked up from the office of the board of commissioners. After use has been completed, the telephone and key are to be returned to the office of the board of commissioners. If the building has been cleaned and everything is in proper order after inspection by the county administrator or someone he may designate, a portion of the deposit will be refunded. The amount of the refund shall be as provided in the schedule of fees and charges.
(2)
For use by a nonprofit group or individual, a fee shall be charged in an amount as provided in the schedule of fees and charges. A deposit in an amount as provided in the schedule of fees and charges must be paid at the time the key and telephone are picked up from the office of the board of commissioners.

(Code 1992, § 2-2)
Editor's note— The form to request use of livestock facilities is on file in the county administrator's office.
Sec. 2-3. - Claims against county.
Claims for personal injury or property damage presented to the county shall be immediately forwarded to the county's liability insurance agent. If the claim is covered by the terms of one or more of the county's liability policies then the decision to honor or reject the claim shall be solely that of the company issuing the coverage. If for any reason the claim is not covered by a policy of insurance or does not exceed the per-claim deductible the matter shall be investigated by the county administrator and the county attorney. They shall present their recommendation to the full board for consideration.
(Code 1992, § 2-3)
State Law reference— Claims against counties, O.C.G.A. § 36-11-1 et seq.
Sec. 2-4. - Defense of claims against public officials.
(a)
The board of commissioners carries public official liability insurance which extends coverage to all public officers of the county for claims made against them arising out of performance of their official duties. If, for whatever reason, a particular claim is asserted against a public official or employee of the county which is not covered by insurance, then the board of commissioners reserves the right, pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 45-9-21 and 45-9-22, to provide a defense to the public official or employee and to pay any claim or judgment rendered against the official or employee on a case-by-case basis.
(b)
Generally, all such claims would be defended except those alleging criminal violations in which the county is specifically prohibited from providing a defense. Additionally, certain claims might create a conflict between the board of commissioners and a particular public officer or employee and, in those instances, the providing of a defense or the payment of the claim will be determined by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. In that event, the county attorney will be requested to give to the board of commissioners a written opinion as to whether or not a conflict in fact exists and if, under the circumstances, the county would be legally authorized to provide a defense or pay such a claim, prior to any decision by the board of commissioners.

Sec. 2-61. - Agenda.
(a)
At every regular or special meeting of the board of commissioners, the board shall be presented with an established agenda delineating the subjects to be discussed at the meeting. This agenda shall be prepared by the county administrator in consultation with the chairman, the members of the board, the county attorney and, if he deems necessary, appropriate department heads or other elected officials. At the beginning of each meeting, members of the board will be given an opportunity to add subjects to the agenda for either regular or executive session discussion. With the permission of the chairman, other county officials in attendance may be granted the same privilege. Once the agenda is approved, other matters will not be discussed unless good cause can be demonstrated for their failure to be placed on the agenda prior to approval and a majority of the members present approve their inclusion. Once the agenda has been completed the chairman shall adjourn the meeting and no further official action will be taken.
(b)
No later than 12:00 noon on the day preceding a regularly scheduled or called meeting of the board of commissioners the county administrator shall prepare a proposed executive session agenda and shall circulate the same to the members of the commission and the county attorney. Any commissioner wishing to place a matter on the agenda for executive session shall have the responsibility of communicating this to the county administrator in time for him to include the same on this proposed agenda.
(c)
The county attorney, on his own initiative or at the request of a member of the board, shall review the proposed agenda and shall inform the county administrator if he considers any item on the agenda not to be proper for consideration in executive session. His decision in this regard shall be final unless overturned by a majority vote of the commissioners present at the regular or called meeting. Such discussion and vote shall take place in open session.
(d)
If a member of the board, the county administrator, or the county attorney seeks to place a matter on the executive session agenda for discussion after the same has been disseminated and reviewed, it shall require a vote of at least three commissioners to amend the proposed agenda and add such additional matter. This discussion and vote shall also take place in the open session.
(e)
No other matters except those set forth in the proposed agenda or added to the agenda by the method outlined above shall be discussed in an executive session of any regular or called meeting of the board.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(a))
Sec. 2-62. - Requests to address board.
Any person who is not a board member wishing to address the board on any subject at any regular or called meeting must contact the county administrator by 4:00 p.m. on Thursday prior to the scheduled meeting and request to be placed on the agenda, and shall advise the administrator as to the general subject matter which he wishes to discuss with the board. Upon good cause shown and with the concurrence of a majority of the members present the chairman may waive this prior notice requirement for a specific individual or group at a particular meeting.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(b))
Sec. 2-63. - Imposition of time limits.
In the interest of time, and so that the board may adequately consider all matters that come before it, the chairman may limit the time to be allocated to any individual or any particular subject presented for discussion.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(c))
Sec. 2-64. - Requests for expenditure of funds.
Any request presented to the commissioners that involves the expenditure of monies not previously allocated in the current year's budget may be considered and discussed if properly brought before the board. However, no such request shall be voted on at the first meeting at which it is presented except by unanimous consent of all members present.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(d))
Sec. 2-65. - Voting members.
All members of the board, including the chairman or acting chairman, are full voting members and are entitled to vote on any motion properly brought to the floor.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(e))
Sec. 2-66. - Manner of voting.
A general motion shall be passed or defeated by voice vote, except the chairman may, when he feels it necessary or it is legally compelled, call for a show of hands.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(f))
Sec. 2-66a. - Conduct during meetings.
During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings members of the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Speak without first being recognized by the chair;
(2)
Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
(3)
Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
(4)
Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the chair, if he is ruled out of order by the chair;
(5)
Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the persons involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(6)
Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me __________?" or "Do you remember telling me __________?" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me __________," or "Why did you tell me ___________ before the meeting." The purpose of the public portion of a commissioner's meeting is to allow each commissioner, county representatives and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to cross-examined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(7)
State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in a such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject of job performance are proper, but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portions of the meeting. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by a commissioner during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a commissioner during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session.
(8)
Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the board as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a commissioner shall not state that the board will or will not do something, nor shall a commissioner state what the board's vote will be on an issue. No single commissioner can speak on behalf of the board unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so.
(9)
Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by majority vote of the board. By way of example, a commissioner is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a commissioner shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken.
(10)
Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make a specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the board, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session.
(Ord. of 11-19-2018(1))
Sec. 2-66b. - Conduct outside of meetings.
A member of the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners shall not:
(1)
Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county administrator. Once such a request is made, the commissioners shall follow-up with the county administrator regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the commissioner expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county administrator first; if the commissioner is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the board of commissioners in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted.
a.
Exceptions to this include the relaying of road concerns to the public works director and road superintendents, as it is in the best interest of the county for road concerns to be relayed quickly. However, the prioritization and completion of those concerns will be the responsibility of the county administrator, public works director, and road superintends unless otherwise voted on by the board.
b.
In case of true emergency, exigent circumstances, or in the absence of a county administrator, commissioners shall be free to act in the best interests of the county and its citizens by communicating directly with the necessary department. As soon as is practical thereafter, the commissioners shall notify the county administrator of said communications. The ultimate prioritization and completion of the concerns expressed by the commissioner shall be the responsibility of the administrator unless otherwise voted on by the board.
(2)
Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single commissioner has the authority to hire or fire county personnel.
(3)
Reprimand any county employee. If a commissioner believes a county employee should be reprimanded he shall so inform the county administrator. If a commissioner believes the county administrator should be reprimanded he shall notify the other members of the board of commissioners. No single commissioner has the authority to discipline county personnel.
(4)
Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee.
(5)
Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concerns of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outline in Section II, Rule 1, above.
(6)
Demand that the county administrator or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the commissioner's business. If the county administrator or a department head requests that the commissioner schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the commissioner shall honor that request.
(7)
Promise on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners to undertake any act, or to pass any ordinance, resolution, contract or agreement. A single commissioner has no authority to bind the board of commissioners.
(8)
Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(9)
Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or any representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the board of commissioners. By way of example, it is permissible for any commissioner to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Emanuel County by the parties involved). However, a commissioner shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans, or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that commissioner has received express authorization in advance by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in a commissioner's district is of no consequence, as a commissioner has no additionally legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district.
(10)
Speak to any representative of the news media on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners without advance approval by majority vote of the board of commissioners. By way of example, a commissioner is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the board of commissioners or in the name of Emanuel County unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(Ord. of 11-19-2018(1))
Sec. 2-66c. - Penalties.
The board of commissioners shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this section. Any commissioner shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of this section to the attention of the full board. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the board of commissioners present. If the board determines by majority vote that a violation of this section has occurred, the board shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending commissioner:
(1)
A verbal censure that shall be noted in the minutes without further elaboration;
(2)
A written censure, to be made a part of the minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation;
(3)
Removal of the commissioner from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending commissioner is in involved in his capacity as Emanuel County Commissioner; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the board of commissioners, to the head of such committee, association or group, stating that the offending commissioner is no longer authorized to represent Emanuel County. This sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of offense.
(4)
A fine, not to exceed $500.00 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending Commissioner to the general fund of Emanuel County, Georgia within ten days of the board's vote establishing a violation; if the offending commissioner fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending commissioner's compensation as a commissioner.
The decision of the Emanuel County Board of Commissioners on any question concerning a violation of this section, or the penalty imposed, shall be final, it being the express intent of all the commissioners to govern themselves, and not to abdicate this responsibility to any other person or entity.
(Ord. of 11-19-2018(1))
Sec. 2-67. - Motions generally.
In order to be a proper subject for discussion or action, all motions must receive a second. Motions to amend an existing motion take precedence and shall be passed or defeated before a vote on the main motion unless the amendment is consented to by the member who made the motion and the member who seconded the original motion. A motion to table any matter is to take precedence over all other then-pending motions. Motions to table, if properly seconded, shall be called for the question immediately, without further discussion.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(g))

Sec. 2-69. - Suspension of rules.
Except for those matters which require unanimous consent as outlined in this section, any specific rule or the rules in their entirety may be suspended at any given meeting by majority vote of the members present.
(Code 1992, § 2-32(i))
Sec. 2-70. - Executive sessions.

No ordinance shall relate to more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title, and no ordinance, or section of such ordinance, shall be amended or repealed unless the new ordinance contains the title of the ordinance or section amended or repealed, and when practicable, all ordinances shall be introduced as amendments to this Code.

State Law reference— Random drug testing of state employees in high-risk jobs, O.C.G.A. § 45-20-90 et seq.; Drug-Free Public Work Force Act of 1990, O.C.G.A. § 45-23-1 et seq.

Sec. 2-266. - Drug policy.
(a)
The welfare and success of the county depends on the well-being of all of its employees. The abuse of drugs poses a serious threat to everyone involved.
(b)
It is the responsibility of both the county and the employee to maintain a safe, healthful and productive work environment. The county is committed to fulfilling this obligation; therefore, the following policy of having a workplace free from substance abuse is adopted. Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment for all employees.
Sec. 2-267. - Policy statement.
(a)
The possession, sale, use, manufacture, distribution or dispensation of illegal drugs or controlled substances without a prescription during work time or on county premises at any time is prohibited. Applicants and employees may be requested to submit to drug testing and searches of personal property as a condition of employment in accordance with this policy. The county also reserves the right to search employees, work areas and any other county property used by employees.
(b)
Any employee under the influence of illegal drugs or controlled substances without a prescription while on the job is subject to immediate discharge. The term "under the influence" is defined as being unable to perform work in a safe and productive manner; being in a physical or mental condition which creates a risk to the safety and well-being of the affected employee, other employees, the public or county property; and/or having any detectable level of drugs or controlled substances in the body.
(c)
All employees are required to notify the head of their department if they are convicted or plead guilty or no contest to violation of any criminal drug statute.
(d)
The county will fully cooperate in any accident investigation to determine if drugs were involved.
Sec. 2-268. - Drug testing.
(a)
To help ensure a safe, healthful and productive work environment, job applications and employees may be asked to provide body substance samples such as urine, saliva or blood to determine the use of illegal drugs or controlled substances as a condition of employment. Refusal to submit to drug testing, or the adulteration of the sample, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
(b)
Testing for the presence of drugs may occur for any reason including (but not limited to) the following:
(1)
Random.
(2)
Job applicant testing after a conditional offer of employment has been made.
(3)
Post-accident.
(4)
Reasonable suspicion.
Sec. 2-269. - Corrective action.
(a)
Regardless of the events which led to the drug screening, a positive test generally will result in termination of employment. Disciplinary action cannot be avoided by a request for assistance with a drug problem after being asked to participate in a substance test or after being involved in an event which requires testing.
(b)
However, if any employee seeks assistance with a drug problem prior to being asked to submit to a test, a substance test will be conducted and a positive test result will not lead to immediate employment termination. Rather the employee will be expected to participate in a rehabilitation program and will subject to more frequent random substance tests; if any subsequent tests are positive, termination of employment likely would result.
Sec. 2-270. - Searches.
(a)
The county reserves the right to conduct searches or inspection of county property, including desk, vehicles, equipment or other areas, wherever located. Employee entry on the county's premises constitutes consent to such searches or inspections, and consent to such searches and inspections is a condition of initial employment. Consent to a search of the employee's clothing (including pockets), purse, briefcase, vehicle or other personal property at the time of the search is a condition of continuing employment, and refusal of consent is insubordination justifying termination of employment.
(b)
Searches or inspections may be conducted at the discretion of the county from time to time without prior announcement.
(c)
An employee's refusal to consent to a search of his clothing or personal effects or attempt to interfere with a search of county property will result in the immediate suspension of the employee pending a county investigation. The county will then make a determination concerning the appropriate discipline for the employee, up to and including discharge, on the basis of the evidence then available to the county, any inferences which the county draws from that evidence, and the employee's refusal to consent to the search or interfere with the search.
(d)
The purpose of such searches or inspections under this policy is to determine whether any employee possesses or is under the influence of drugs or controlled substances in violation of the county rule which strictly prohibits any employee from being at work in possession of or under the influence of illegal drugs or controlled substances.
Sec. 2-271. - Addendum to county personnel policy.
All applicants for employment with the county in a safety-sensitive capacity, as that term is defined in the county's drug-free workplace policy, shall be required to submit to a pre-employment alcohol and drug screen. All non-safety-sensitive applicants will submit to a post-job offer screen.
