ARTICLE II. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 118-29. - Initial information.
The administrative officer will show the developer a copy of this chapter. The developer may either review the document in the office or he may purchase a copy for his own use.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 401)
Sec. 118-30. - Appealing an action of the mayor and council.
If the mayor and council executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed to the county superior court. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action of the mayor and council was taken.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 411)
Sec. 118-31. - Appealing an action of the administrative officer or planning commission.
(a)
If the administrative officer or planning commission executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action by the administrative officer was taken.
(b)
The board of appeals has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the administrative officer related to this chapter. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the administrative officer, who will transmit them to the board of appeals for its consideration.
(c)
When an action of the administrative officer or planning commission is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the administrative officer may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. The administrative officer may certify to the board of appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order is granted by either the board of appeals or a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
(d)
When an application for appeal of an action of the administrative officer is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the board of appeals by U. S. mail at least 15 days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead.
(e)
The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Further appeal on points of law may be made to the county superior court.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 406)
Sec. 118-32. - Variances.
(a)
A variance is a permit, issued by the board of appeals, which allows use of a parcel of land in a way that does not meet certain requirements for the district in which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where an extreme hardship would result if all of the requirements of this chapter were applied stringently to a particular piece of property. The hardship must be proven by showing beyond a doubt that reasonable use of the land is not possible if all of the requirements of this chapter are to be met. The hardship cannot be self-created such as:
(1)
A lot purchased with knowledge of an existing restriction.
(2)
A claim of hardship in terms of prospective sales.
(3)
An expressed economic need requiring a variance, when such a need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance.
(b)
Relief from the hardship, the variance, must not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of this chapter.
(c)
When a variance is issued, the spirit of this chapter must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located (for example, a two-family dwelling would not be allowed to be placed in an R-1 district under a variance).
(d)
The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or the mayor and council may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the board of appeals.
(e)
Application for a variance may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the board of appeals for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of this chapter. If an applicant for a variance or any other action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of this chapter, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:
(1)
He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
(2)
Has been tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and presents a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within 30 days of the final order of the court.
(f)
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either subsection (e)(1) or (2) of this section, the administrative officer will then accept the application for variance.
(g)
When an application for a variance is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place and subject of the hearing. At least 15 days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner and all property owners within 300 feet of the subject property in writing by U.S. mail. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant file for permanent record.
(h)
The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting.
(i)
The variance issued by the board of appeals must specify which requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative requirements to be met, replacing the requirements varied from.
(j)
The board of appeals may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six months.
(k)
The decision of the board of appeals on the application for variance may be appealed on points of law to the county superior court.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 407)
Sec. 118-33. - Conditional zoning.
(a)
When a parcel of property is placed in a certain zoning district, all permitted uses for that zoning district are allowed on the property as long as the published requirements of this chapter and other development regulations of the city are met. However, in certain situations, only one of the permitted uses for a district may be appropriate for a parcel of property while many of the other uses within the range of those permitted would not be appropriate, or certain design, location, aesthetic, or other standards may be needed to mask otherwise undesirable effects of a permitted use. In such cases, conditional zoning may be granted by the mayor and council.
(b)
The following situations are permitted under conditional zoning:
(1)
The use of land may be specifically limited to any one or more of the permitted uses for the zoning district in which the land is placed.
(2)
Special requirements of design, location, aesthetics, or other considerations may be imposed for the uses permitted on the land.
(3)
Any combination of the two categories of conditions in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section may be imposed.
(c)
Conditional zoning is attached to a specific lot or group of lots, not to the owner. If ownership of the lot changes, continued compliance with the special conditions must be maintained by the new owner.
(d)
Conditional zoning may be proposed by the mayor and council, the planning commission, the petitioner for a zoning amendment, or any person who may be affected by the subject property.
(e)
A tract of land to which special conditions have been attached continues to be subject to all other requirements of this chapter and other applicable regulations of the city which are not in conflict with those special conditions.
(f)
Whenever a tract of land has had special conditions imposed upon it and a building permit is applied for, plans and specifications which are drawn in compliance with the special conditions must be submitted with the application for a permit.
(g)
Three sets of plans and specifications must be submitted to the administrative officer in application for a building permit. Upon approval, the administrative officer will certify in writing his approval upon the plans and specifications. The copies of the approved plans and specifications will be distributed as follows:
(1)
One copy to the record of rezoning file.
(2)
One copy to the administrative officer.
(3)
One copy to the applicant.
(h)
When conditional zoning has been granted for a parcel of property, and no building permit for the property has been applied for within 12 months of the date of such conditional zoning, the property will revert to its original zoning prior to the conditional zoning. However, the owner of the property conditionally zoned may request the mayor and council to extend the conditional zoning for up to 12 months. If the mayor and council find just cause for extending the conditional zoning, it may be extended for a period of up to 12 months.
(i)
The zoning of any parcel of land which is subject to special conditions will be indicated on the official map by its zoning district designation followed by "C" (for example, R-1-C).
(j)
Any granting of conditional zoning is an amendment of this chapter, and procedures contained in section 118-5 must be followed.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 408)
Sec. 118-34. - Special exceptions.
(a)
Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the mayor and city council following preliminary review by the planning commission. These uses are identified in this chapter as special exceptions and in each case carry specific circumstances under which the use should or should not be allowed.
(b)
The developer or owner wishing to request a special exception must have at least 51 percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or mayor and city council may also propose a special exception. However, the power to approve a special exception rests with the mayor and city council.
(c)
Application for a special exception may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the mayor and city council for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of this chapter. If an applicant for special exception or any other action by the mayor and city council is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of this chapter, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
(d)
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this chapter, the administrative officer will then accept the application for special exception.
(e)
When an application for a special exception is received, the mayor and city council will set a time and place for a public hearing on the special exception. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least 15 days, but not more than 45 days before the hearing. Such a notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place, and subject of the hearing. At least 15 days prior to the hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the applicant and all property owners within 300 feet of the subject property in writing by U.S. mail. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file for permanent record.
(f)
All applications for a special exception must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission will study the proposed special exception and determine if it meets the requirements of this chapter, as well as other applicable ordinances of the city. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed special exception and make written recommendations to the planning commission.
(g)
The planning commission will consider the following points in arriving at a recommendation on the special exception:
(1)
It must not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties, or to the general neighborhood; it must not adversely affect the health or safety of residents or workers.
(2)
It must not be that any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties are greater than the benefits or need for the special exception.
(3)
It must not adversely affect existing uses, and it must be proposed to be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use.
(4)
It must not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such a facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes generated, or type of physical activity.
(5)
It must meet all other requirements of this chapter.
(h)
The planning commission will make a written record of its findings along with its recommendations on the proposed special exception and forward a copy of its findings and recommendations to the mayor and city council within 60 days of the date on which the proposed special exception application was received by the administrative officer.
(i)
The mayor and city council must then conduct a public hearing on the special exception.
(j)
The following policies and procedures will be observed in conducting the required public hearing:
(1)
The hearing will be held in the city council room. All persons who wish to address the mayor and city council at a hearing shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the hearing body prior to the commencement of the hearing.
(2)
The mayor and city council will cause to be read the proposed zoning decisions under consideration and any departmental reviews pertaining thereto prior to receiving public input.
(3)
The mayor and city council shall call each person who has signed up to speak on the proposed zoning decision in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except for the applicant, who will always speak first, or of the hearing body is bringing a proposed zoning decision to the hearing, then the hearing body shall speak first. Only those persons signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless the mayor and city council, in their discretion, vote to make an exception at the time of the hearing, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing.
(4)
The length of time for oral presentations permitted to each speaker will be determined by the mayor and will depend upon the number of persons present and desiring to speak.
(k)
After reviewing the record of the public hearing and considering the recommendations of the planning commission, the mayor and city council, applying the criteria set forth in subsection (g) of this section, as applicable, may approve or deny the requested special exception, or impose conditions which may restrict the use or development of the special exception use in a manner not otherwise required by this chapter.
(l)
If the mayor and city council denies a proposed special exception, a minimum period of 12 months must pass before the same special exception proposal is again submitted for consideration.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 409; Ord. of 4-19-2006(1), § 1)
Sec. 118-35. - Building permit required.
(a)
The developer or other person wishing to do any of the following must first apply to the administrative officer for a building permit:
(1)
Excavation or filling of a lot for the construction of a building.
(2)
Erection, movement, extension, or enlargement of a building.
(3)
Work on an existing building which entails structural change.
(4)
Installation of a manufactured home.
(5)
Building or modifying any electrical service.
(b)
No electricity, water, or sewage hookup will be made available to the site of new construction until a building permit is secured.
(c)
The building permit must be applied for either by the owner of the land upon which the proposed building or alteration is to be located, or by the contractor doing the work.
(d)
The applicant may obtain a building permit application from the administrative officer. He should complete the application form and submit it to the administrative officer, together with any supporting documentation which the administrative officer may specify.
(e)
No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of this chapter. If an applicant for a building permit is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of this chapter, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following:
(1)
He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.
(2)
He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within 30 days of the final order of the court.
(f)
When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either subsection (e)(1) or (2) of this section, the administrative officer will then accept the application for building permit.
(g)
Before a building permit is issued by the administrative officer, the county health department must approve the sewage disposal facilities required in connection with the proposed building or structure. In areas served by a public water and sewerage system, the health department may elect to waive the requirement for approval. After a study of the site of a proposed use, the health department may require for health reasons that all or any portion of the site not be used for the intended purpose. The health department may also set a minimum lot size larger than that required by this chapter. The city will either approve or disapprove the water and sewer facilities within 30 days of receipt of the application from the administrative officer, providing a written decision, including reasons for the decision.
(h)
An existing use which is altered or extended must meet applicable city building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of an existing use, the administrative officer will inspect the use and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the use into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations before a building permit may be issued.
(i)
The administrative officer is in charge of issuing building permits. The administrative officer will contact the applicant at the address shown on the application. The building permit will be issued if, upon review of the application and inspection of the site, the administrative officer is satisfied that the proposed project will meet the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable ordinances. The administrative officer may require the submission of additional materials if he concludes additional information is needed in order to determine if the proposed project meets the requirements of this chapter.
(j)
If the administrative officer feels that the proposed project as presented in the building permit application will not satisfy the requirements of this chapter, he will not issue a building permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a building permit.
(k)
Construction on an approved project must start within six months from the date of issue of the building permit, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired at a future date. If construction has begun on an approved project and then ceases before the project is completed, construction must be restarted within 12 months from the time that it was stopped, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired to resume at a future date. Records of building permit applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the administrative officer.
(l)
All newly constructed buildings, as well as additions, extensions, or enlargements of structures must comply with all building codes in effect in the city. The administrative officer will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 404)
Sec. 118-36. - Certificate of occupancy required.
(a)
A certificate of occupancy is required before a structure, for which a building permit has been issued, may be occupied or used. The building permit becomes the certificate of occupancy when the administrative officer signs it in the appropriate space, certifying that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of this chapter have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of occupancy to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of this chapter.
(b)
The administrative officer will issue the certificate of occupancy within ten days of receiving the building permit with required certifications, if he finds that all requirements of this chapter and all other applicable ordinances have been met. However, if he finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of occupancy, the administrative officer will not issue the certificate of occupancy. He will notify the owner/contractor within ten days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with this chapter and be eligible for a certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 405)
Sec. 118-37. - Continuance of nonconforming uses.
Invariably, at the time a land use and development control ordinance is adopted or amended, certain uses which lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to the regulations and standards for the districts in which they are located. These are known as nonconforming uses, and in order to feasibly adopt the ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of nonconforming uses, these uses are allowed to continue under special conditions as outlined in the following parts of this section:
(1)
Where a nonconforming use of a building or lot has ceased for more than six months or has changed to a permitted or conforming use, further use of the building or lot must be in conformance with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located.
(2)
A nonconforming use must not be extended or altered unless the extension or alteration is in conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
(3)
A nonconforming use which is altered or extended must meet applicable city building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of a nonconforming use, the administrative officer will inspect the unit and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the unit into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations. Upon determining that the unit meets applicable building codes and development regulations, he will issue the building permit for the nonconforming use.
(4)
If a nonconforming building or structure suffers damage which does not exceed 50 percent of its assessed valuation, the building or structure may be reconstructed and reused as before if done within 12 months from the time such damage occurred. If such damage is greater than 50 percent of its assessed valuation, such a building or structure may only be reconstructed and used in conformity with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located.
(5)
A use which is nonconforming only with respect to screening or buffer requirements must provide required screens or buffers within a period of three years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. This time period is to allow for the growth of natural vegetative buffers.
(Ord. of 10-1-1996, § 403)
