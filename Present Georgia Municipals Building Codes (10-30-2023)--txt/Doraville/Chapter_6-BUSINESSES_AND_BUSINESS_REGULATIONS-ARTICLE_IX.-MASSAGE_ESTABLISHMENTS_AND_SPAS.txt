--- (9) ---
Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2014-13, adopted Dec. 15, 2014, repealed art. IX in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former art. IX, §§ 6-296—6-320 pertained to massage parlors and derived from Ord. No. 2011-01, § 1, adopted Jan. 3, 2011; Ord. No. 2011-38, § 4, adopted Nov. 7, 2011; Ord. No. 2012-08, §§ 1, 2, adopted March 22, 2012; Ord. No. 2013-11, § 1, adopted June 17, 2013.
State Law reference— Deceptive trade practices with respect to health spas, O.C.G.A. § 10-1-392 et seq.; giving of massages in place used for lewdness, prostitution or masturbation for hire, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-17; Georgia Physical Therapy Act, O.C.G.A. § 43-33-1 et seq.; levy of occupational tax on practitioners of massage and physiotherapy only at place of principal office, O.C.G.A. § 48-13-5.

Sec. 6-296. - Purpose and legislative findings.
The Georgia General Assembly has declared that the practice of massage therapy is an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public and that the practice of massage therapy by a person who is not licensed under the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 43-24A-1 et seq.) is a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The City Council agrees with those findings. Furthermore, the City Council finds that, for many massage establishments, the business in fact is sexual conduct or the intimation of sexual conduct, rather than lawful massage therapy. Such establishments offer massage services as a subterfuge for prostitution, masturbation for hire, and other paid sexual contact, which are harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. There is difficulty and expense in conclusively distinguishing between such establishments and legitimate massage establishments, but one (1) rational distinction is whether the establishment has a relationship with a corporate or franchising hierarchy, which would tend to safeguard against unlawful sexual activities on the massage establishment premises. It is a purpose of this article to impose licensing requirements to help prevent illegal massage, prostitution, and related sex crimes, yet without hindering legitimate massage establishments operating under a business structure with external oversight that serves that purpose. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22 (allowing local regulation of massage businesses and of persons not licensed by the state), it is the purpose of this article to regulate the operation of massage establishments and spa establishments, and to regulate employees of such establishments who are not licensed as massage therapists by the state, as an exercise of the City's police power in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City.
