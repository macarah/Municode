Sec. 5-212. - Applicability.
This article adopts the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED-NC) Rating System, Version 2.2. Any future amendments thereto will be reviewed by the City before consideration is given to the adoption of such amendments. The LEED-NC system (for new construction) establishes several levels of environment achievement from certified rating to a platinum rating. The ratings are attained by earning LEED points in the categories of sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality and innovation and design process.
Developments with new construction of a commercial building, office building, industrial building, multiple residence or senior citizen multiple-residence equal to or greater than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of gross floor area space are encouraged, but not required, to seek LEED certification. Furthermore, this article shall be applicable to all new construction of municipal buildings regardless of square footage.

Sec. 5-215. - Green building certification.
(a)
Compliance and enforcement. The building inspector or his designee shall determine whether the requirements under this pre-permitting documentation are implemented at each stage of construction, including at the foundation inspection, framing inspection, and prior to issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. The building inspector or his designee may conduct other inspections, as needed, to ensure compliance with this article.
The building inspector or his designee shall review the information submitted by the applicant and determine whether the applicant will achieve the required certification as set forth herein. If the building inspector or his designee finds that the applicant is not reasonably expected to achieve LEED certification, the building inspector or his designee shall make the following findings:
(1)
If the covered project has not met the requirements for certification as set forth herein, whether the applicant has made a good faith effort to comply with the article;
(2)
If the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation within the time period as set forth in the regulations, or fails to submit such documentation within a reasonable time period as determined by the building inspector or his designee, whether the final building permit approval or certificate of occupancy should be withheld;
(3)
If the applicant has not complied with this article, whether the applicant should be required to undertake further actions to mitigate this noncompliance.
(b)
Infeasibility exemption. The building inspector or his designee may issue an exemption from any of the requirements of this article upon finding that circumstances exist that make it a hardship or infeasible for the applicant to meet those requirements. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to:
(1)
The availability of markets for materials to be recycled;
(2)
The availability of green building materials and technologies; and
(3)
The compatibility of green building requirements with existing building standards.
The burden shall be on the applicant to show circumstances to establish infeasibility.
