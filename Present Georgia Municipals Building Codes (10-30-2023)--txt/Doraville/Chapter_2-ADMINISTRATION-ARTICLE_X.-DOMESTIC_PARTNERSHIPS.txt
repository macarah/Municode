Sec. 2-250. - Introduction.
The City of Doraville shall provide, with respect to the City programs and services, equal treatment to the residents of the City and employees of the City, to the extent allowed by the terms and procedures of such programs and services.
(Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 2008-13, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 2009-32, § 1, 11-16-09)
Sec. 2-251. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
(a)
Declaration of domestic partnership means a form provided by the City Clerk's office in which two (2) people agree to be jointly responsible for the necessities of life incurred during the domestic partnership and that all qualifications for domestic partnership are met when the declaration is signed. The form will require both partners to provide reasonable proof of their primary, regular and permanent residence address. The form must be signed under penalty of perjury and must be witnessed and notarized. The City Clerk's office shall, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this ordinance, make such forms available. To help defray costs associated with the providing and filing of these forms, the City Clerk's office is authorized to charge a fee as set forth herein for each completed form.
(b)
Domestic partnership means two (2) adults who live together in the mutual interdependence of a single home and have signed a declaration of domestic partnership in which they attest that:
(1)
They share the same primary, regular and permanent residence and have lived together for the previous twelve (12) months (documentation must be submitted verifying joint residency);
(2)
They have a committed personal relationship with each other that is mutually interdependent and intended to be lifelong;
(3)
They agree to be jointly obligated and responsible for the necessities of life for each other;
(4)
They are not married to anyone or legally separated from anyone;
(5)
They are eighteen (18) years of age or older;
(6)
They are competent to enter into a contract;
(7)
They are not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the state;
(8)
They are each other's sole domestic partner;
(9)
They agree to file a termination of domestic partnership within thirty (30) days if any of the facts set out in this definition change; and
(10)
Any prior domestic partnership in which their domestic partner participated with a third party was terminated not less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of such affidavit, and, if such earlier domestic partnership had been acknowledged under provisions of this section, that notice of termination of such earlier domestic partnership was provided to the City in writing to the business license division of the department of finance not less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of said affidavit. If the prior domestic partnership was terminated by the death of the partner, there shall be no waiting period.
(c)
Live together means that two (2) people claiming domestic partnership status share the same primary, regular and permanent residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess the residence be in both names. Domestic partners do not cease to live together if one (1) leaves the shared residence for a period not to exceed one (1) year, but intends to return. Whether the relationship between these two (2) people is or is not sexual is in no way relevant for the purposes of determining eligibility under this article.
(d)
Necessities of life means the cost of basic food, shelter, clothing and medical care. The individuals need not contribute equally or jointly to the cost of these expenses as long as they agree that both are responsible and obligated for the cost.

Sec. 2-252. - Legal effect of declaration.

(2)
Nothing in this article shall be construed to explicitly or implicitly create a marital relationship.
(3)
Nothing contained in this article shall create any rights in either domestic partner that are not covered, included or created in the underlying insurance or benefits plan documents of the City.
(4)
This article does not attempt to alter or affect the laws in the state that regulate any private or civil relationships.

Sec. 2-253. - Establishment.
(a)
Generally. Domestic partners who are residents of the City or who are employees of the City may establish the existence of their domestic partnership by presenting an original declaration of domestic partnership to the City Clerk's office of the City along with reasonable proof of residence such as, but not limited to, a driver's license, utility bill, or state I.D. card. The City Clerk's office will file the declaration and provide the partners with a certificate showing that the declaration was filed with the City Clerk's office. The standard declaration form will be available in the business license office during normal business hours.
(b)
Limitations. The City Clerk shall only accept for filing declarations of domestic partnership submitted by domestic partners who have residence in the City or who are employees of the City.
(c)
Amendments to the declaration. A partner may amend a declaration of domestic partnership filed with the City Clerk's office at any time to show a change in such partner's primary residence address.
(d)
New declarations of domestic partnership. No person who has created a domestic partnership may create another until twelve (12) months after a notice of termination has been signed and filed with the City Clerk's office; provided, however, that if the domestic partnership ended because of the death of the other party, a new declaration may be filed any time after the notice of termination has been filed.
(e)
Evidence of domestic partnership. Any person who requires a person to provide evidence of the existence of a domestic partnership must accept the declaration of domestic partnership, but may choose not to require the declaration as complete proof of the existence of a domestic partnership. The declaration of domestic partnership may be considered reasonable proof for qualifying for any present or future domestic partner benefits that private corporations or public institutions offer.
