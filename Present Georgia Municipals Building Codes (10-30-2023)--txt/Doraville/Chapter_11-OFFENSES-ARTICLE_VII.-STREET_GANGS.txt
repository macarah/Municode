Sec. 11-190. - Short title.
This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Doraville Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 07-03, § 1(11-180), 5-21-07)
Sec. 11-191. - Legislative intent.
(a)
The Mayor and City Council find and declare that it is the right of every person to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. It is not the intent of this article to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association. The Mayor and City Council recognize the constitutional right of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any lawful subject whatsoever, to associate lawfully with others who share similar beliefs, to petition lawfully constituted authority for a redress of perceived grievances, and to participate in the electoral process.
(b)
The Mayor and City Council, however, further find that the City of Doraville is in a state of crisis which has been caused by violent street gangs whose members threaten, terrorize, and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities, both individually and collectively, present a clear and present danger to public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected.
(c)
The Mayor and City Council find that there are criminal street gangs operating in the City and that the number of gang-related crimes is increasing. It is the intent of the Mayor and City Council in enacting this article to seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs which together are the chief source of terror created by street gangs.
(d)
The Mayor and City Council further find that an effective means of punishing and deterring the criminal activities of street gangs is through forfeiture of the profits, proceeds, and instrumentalities acquired, accumulated, or used by street gangs.
