ARTICLE IV. - REVISED PLAT

Sec. 17.5-71. - Procedure for revising final plat.
When it becomes necessary to revise a recorded final plat due to some error, required adjustment or desired adjustment, the developer shall confer with the City Planner and the county subdivision administrator to verify if such proposed revision will comply with the requirements of the zoning ordinance and these subdivision regulations.
If it is established that such a revision is feasible, the developer shall have his engineer make the necessary corrections on the original linen of the final plat or prepare a new linen tracing of that portion of the subdivision involved. The subdivision name, date and book and page number of the original recording shall be noted on the new plat.
The revised plat shall be filed with the City Planner for transmittal to the county subdivision administrator, who shall forward such plat to the proper county departments that would be involved in checking and certifying the revision.
Upon receipt of certification by the proper authorities in the various county departments involved, the revised plat shall be referred to the City Planner for submission to the Planning Commission for approval or disapproval and to the City Council for review and concurrence.
Upon receiving approval from the Planning Commission and concurrence from the City Council, the revised plat shall be submitted to the chairman of the county board of commissioners of roads and revenues for certification.
The approved revised plat will be recorded by the county subdivision administrator and returned to the City Planner and the developer.
Any revised plat that does not receive approval shall be returned to the developer with written notification stating reason for denial attached thereto.
