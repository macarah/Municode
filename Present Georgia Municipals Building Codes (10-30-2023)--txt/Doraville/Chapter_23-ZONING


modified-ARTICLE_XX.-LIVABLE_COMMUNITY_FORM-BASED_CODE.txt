(h)
That a range of open spaces including parks, squares, playgrounds, and preserved green corridors should be distributed throughout Doraville.
(i)
That buildings and landscaping should contribute to the physical definition of thoroughfares as civic places.
(j)
That development should adequately accommodate automobiles while respecting the pedestrian and the spatial form of public areas.
(k)
That community design should reinforce safe environments, but not at the expense of accessibility.
(l)

  TABLE 5: - Civic Space.
EXPAND
a. Park: A natural preserve available for structured or unstructured recreation. A park may be independent of surrounding building Frontages. Its landscape shall consist of Paths and trails, meadows, water bodies, woodland and open shelters, all naturalistically disposed. Parks may also include dog parks within them. Sports and recreation courts and fields are also permitted, but sports stadiums are prohibited. Parks may be lineal, following the trajectories of natural corridors. The minimum size shall be 5 acres.
b. Green: An Open Space, available for structured or unstructured recreation. A Green may be spatially defined by landscaping rather than building Frontages. Its landscape shall consist of lawn and trees, naturalistically disposed. Greens may also include dog parks within them. Sports courts are also permitted, but sports and recreation fields and stadiums are prohibited. The minimum size shall be ½ acre and the maximum shall be 5 acres.
c. Square: An Open Space available for unstructured recreation and Civic purposes. A Square is spatially defined by building Frontages. Its landscape shall consist of paths, lawns and trees, formally disposed. Squares shall be located at the intersection of important Thoroughfares. The minimum size shall be ½ acre and the maximum shall be 5 acres.
d. Plaza: An Open Space available for Civic purposes and Commercial activities. A Plaza shall be spatially defined by building Frontages. Its landscape shall consist primarily of pavement. Trees are optional. Plazas should be located at the intersection of important streets. The minimum size shall be ½ acre and the maximum shall be 2 acres.
e. Playground: An Open Space designed and equipped for the recreation of children. A Playground should be fenced and may include an open shelter. Playgrounds shall be interspersed within Residential areas and may be placed within a Block. Playgrounds may be included within parks and greens. The maximum size of playground shall be 2 acres, provided that playgrounds may also be located within another approved Civic Space identified above.

  TABLE 7: - Building Placement.
This table approximates the location of the structure relative to the boundaries of each individual Lot, establishing suitable basic building types for each Transect Zone.
EXPAND
a. Edgeyard: A building that occupies the center of its lot with Setbacks on all sides. This is the least urban of types as the front yard sets it back from the Frontage, while the side yards weaken the spatial definition of the public Thoroughfare space. The front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings. The rear yard can be secured for privacy by fences and a Backbuilding and/or Outbuilding.
b. Sideyard: A building that occupies one side of the lot with the Setback to the other side. A shallow Frontage Setback defines a more urban condition. If the adjacent building is similar with a blank side wall, the yard can be quite private. This type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to the sun or the breeze. If a Sideyard House abuts a neighboring Sideyard House, the type is known as a Twin or double house. Energy costs, and sometimes noise, are reduced by sharing a party wall in this disposition.
c. Rearyard: A building that occupies the full Frontage, leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard. This is a very urban type as the continuous Façade steadily defines the public Thoroughfare. The rear Elevations may be articulated for functional purposes. In its Residential form, this type is the Rowhouse. For its Commercial form, the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking.
d. Courtyard: A building that occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios. This is the most urban of types, as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public Thoroughfare. Because of its ability to accommodate incompatible activities, masking them from all sides, it is recommended for workshops, Lodging and schools. The high security provided by the continuous enclosure is useful for crime-prone areas.
  TABLE 8: - Private Frontages.
The Private Frontage is the areas between the building Facades and the lot lines.
EXPAND
a. Common Yard: a planted Frontage wherein the Façade is set back substantially from the Frontage Line. The front yard created remains unfenced and is visually continuous with adjacent yards, supporting a common landscape. The deep Setback provides a buffer from the higher speed Thoroughfares.
b. Porch & Fence: a planted Frontage where the Façade is set back from the Frontage Line with an attached porch permitted to Encroach. A fence, wall, or hedge at the Frontage Line maintains street spatial definition. Porches shall be no less than 8 feet deep.
c. Terrace or Lightwell: a frontage wherein the Façade is set back from the Frontage Line by an elevated terrace or sunken Lightwell. This type buffers Residential use from urban Sidewalks and removes the private yard from public encroachment. Terraces are suitable for conversion to outdoor cafes. Syn: Dooryard.
d. Forecourt: a Frontage wherein the Façade is close to the Frontage Line and the central portion is set back. The forecourt created is suitable for vehicular drop-offs. This type should be allocated in conjunction with other Frontage types. Large trees within the Forecourts may overhang the Sidewalks.
e. Stoop: a Frontage wherein the Façade is aligned close to the Frontage Line with the first Story elevated from the Sidewalk sufficiently to ensure privacy for the windows. The entrance is usually an exterior stair and landing. This type is recommended for ground-floor Residential use. Stoops shall be no less than 30 inches deep.
f. Shopfront: a Frontage wherein the Façade is aligned close to the Frontage Line with the building entrance at Sidewalk grade. This type is conventional for Retail use. It has glazing on the Sidewalk level and an awning that should overlap the Sidewalk. Syn: Retail Frontage.
g. Gallery: a Frontage wherein the Façade is aligned with the Frontage Line with an attached cantilevered shed or lightweight colonnade overlapping the Sidewalk. This type is conventional for Retail use. The Gallery should be no less than 10 feet wide and should overlap the sidewalk to within 2 feet of the Curb.
h. Arcade: a collonade supporting habitable space that overlaps the Sidewalk, while the Façade at Sidewalk level remains at or behind the Frontage Line. This type is conventional for Retail use. The Arcade shall be no less than 12 feet wide and should overlap the Sidewalk to within 2 feet of the Curb.
