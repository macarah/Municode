Any person or firm desiring to provide "recycling roll-off container service" in the city shall first obtain an annual permit to do so from the director of public works by making application on forms to be prepared and made available by the director and by paying the application fee required for such permit in an amount fixed by the governing body of the city.
(2)
In addition to the annual permit fee specified above, any person desiring to provide "recycling roll-off container service" in the city shall also pay a "drop fee" for each single "recycling roll-off container" each time a "recycling roll-off container" is dropped or left in the city. Said "drop fee" shall be in an amount to be determined by the governing body of the city in a separate ordinance.
(3)
Any person or firm who has obtained an annual permit for providing "recycling roll-off container service" shall not be required to pay any additional fees for providing such recycling service other than the annual fee specified in subsection (1) above and the "drop fee" specified in subsection (2) above, but no person or firm shall be relieved of paying any sanitary service fees and charges when applicable and due to the city.
(4)
Each "recycling roll-off container" authorized under this Code section shall carry in a conspicuous place the name, address, telephone number, of the person or firm who is responsible for the recycling roll-off container service.
(5)
The city shall not be responsible for placing, emptying, or maintaining any "recycling roll-off container" authorized under this subsection.
(6)
Each person or firm granted an annual permit to provide "recycling roll-off container service" in the city shall indemnify and hold harmless the city and all of its officers, agents, and employees from any and all liability for personal injury or property damage arising out of the provision of said service.
(7)
Prior to being granted the annual permit provided for in subsection (1) above, each person or firm permitted to provide "recycling roll-off container service" in the city shall provide to the director of public works satisfactory evidence of liability insurance coverage in amounts determined by the city.
(8)
Not later than ten (10) calendar days after being issued a drop permit under this section, the holder of the drop permit shall provide to the director of public works a true and correct copy of the manifest that was issued to allow or accept the delivery of the recycling materials that were collected in the recycling roll-off container. Failure to provide the manifest within the time required by this subsection shall be grounds for the director of public works to deny any future drop permits to the person or firm failing to provide said manifest, until all outstanding manifests have been provided to him.
(f)
Except as provided in this Code section, no person or firm shall use or contract for the use of any roll-off containers or compactors within the city, and the city or its designee shall be the exclusive provider of all roll-container services and compact or services in the city.

A sanitary service charge shall be made to occupants, tenants and property owners for the collection services outlined in this chapter. The charge will be made and collected where the service is available unless the service is performed under a permit from the director of public works (see section 5-2-11). Each residential unit and each business establishment in the city is required to use the sanitary services provided by the city; provided, if the solid waste created by any commercial entity be in such form, size or bulk that it cannot be physically handled by equipment employed by the city, or its designee, for the removal of such waste, then, upon application to the city for a plan of private removal, and upon the approval of such a plan, such commercial establishment may be allowed to remove such oversized solid waste material, along with any other waste normally generated by such establishment. The application for permission to make private disposition of such solid waste shall be made through the director of public works, who shall approve any plan designed to make orderly and timely disposition of such outsized solid waste that cannot be collected and disposed of by the city or its designee. Such permit must be renewed annually.
(b)
Sanitary service charges shall be made by the city in accordance with the schedule as fixed from time to time by the mayor and council.
(1)
Fees shall be billed according to the classification of the subscriber as follows:
a.
Classification "A" subscribers shall be billed on the first day of each month and said bill shall be directed to each individual subscriber.
b.
Classification "B" subscribers shall be billed on the first day of each month and said bill shall be directed to the owner of record of the real estate as reflected in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Clayton County, Georgia, Land Records. This bill shall contain the monthly fee for each apartment or space rented therein or available for rent. In the event a building or section of the apartments or spaces are no longer available for rent, the owner shall notify the department of public works, in writing by certified mail, no later than the tenth day of the month preceding the net billing cycle in order to receive an adjustment for the number of apartments no longer available for rent.
c.
Classification "C" subscribers shall be billed on an annual basis. Said bill shall be provided to the owner of the real estate at such time as the owners receive their annual tax bill. The charge for the annual billing shall be reflected on said tax bill as a "sanitation fee."
(2)
In the event any charge remains unpaid after the fifteenth day of each month for classifications "A" or "B", a late charge will be assessed as may be determined from time to time by the mayor and council. In the event any class "C" subscriber charge remains unpaid after the date for which the annual taxes become delinquent, a late charge will be assessed as may be determined from time to time by the mayor and council. Negotiable checks mailed at the Forest Park Post Office and postmarked prior to midnight of the next day prior to the assessment of a late charge will be acceptable and no late charge assessed.
(3)
Classification "C" subscribers who are suffering under an economic hardship, (which shall include, but not be limited to, recipients of Social Security old age benefits, social security disability benefits, or retirement benefits, so long as such individuals have no other substantial income or substantial assets, other than their principal residence) may pay their sanitation fee for their principal residence over a twelve-month period that shall begin on the date of the issuance of the tax bill, provided such classification subscribers obtain a certificate of appreciation from the finance director. The holder of said certificate may elect to pay his/her sanitation fee monthly, quarterly, biannually, or as otherwise agreed upon by the certificate holder and the finance director. Subscribers seeking to obtain a certificate must present proof of economic hardship to the finance director or such other person designated by the finance director to issue certificates. Proof shall be in the form of any legal document evidencing the limited income of the applicant and a sworn statement by the applicant that he/she has no other substantial assets, other than a principal residence, or income, other than the limited income delineated.
(4)
Notwithstanding the exception of subparagraph (3) above, the schedule of charges, fees and deposits for sanitation services shall be in accordance with those fixed from time to time by the mayor and council and shall be kept on file in the offices of the city clerk and the city's public works department.
(5)
Any other provisions of this section notwithstanding, a charge shall be fixed from time to time by the mayor and council and same will be added to the sanitation bill when the same is paid with a check which fails for any reason to clear the payer's bank when presented for payment.
(6)
In the event any sanitation charges remain unpaid that were provided to the real estate owner of record as reflected in the officer of the Superior Court of Clayton County, Georgia, Land Records, said charge shall constitute a lien against the real estate. In the event the sanitation charges herein have been provided to a subscriber who is not he owner of record title as referenced above, said charges shall constitute a lien against the personal property of the subscriber. The city shall be authorized to accomplish collection pursuant to chapter 3 of title 45 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
(7)
In the event the owner, as defined in section 5-2-2-(11) of this Code fails to pay sanitation fees as same become due on more than three (3) occasions within a period of one (1) year, as measured from January 1 through December 31, the director of public works may require the owner to post a deposit in the amount sufficient to cover the next twelve (12) months' charges.

CHAPTER 3. - DRAINAGE IMPROVEMENTS

Sec. 5-3-1. - Legislative findings.
(a)
Due to the type and age of development in Forest Park, and also due to the lack of coordinated engineering ensuring that the drainage improvements would not cause an undue problem downstream, numerous properties in Forest Park are now experiencing or are expected to experience in the future a partial or complete failure of the drainage structures located thereon.
(b)
While most of these drainage structures were built according to accepted engineering practices at the time of construction, experience in urban development has revealed serious flaws in surface-water management for both individual properties and for the City as a whole.
(c)
The failure to properly manage the flow of surface water has the potential to adversely affect the following public interests:
(1)
The health and safety of citizens, including minors and others laboring under disabilities, is imperiled by the creation of flooding conditions and situations conducive to the attraction of vermin, rats, disease-transmitting insects, and other waterborne and airborne-health risks;
(2)
Periodic flooding conditions may undermine public improvements such as roads, streets, sanitary-sewer systems and other city facilities with the resulting impediment to the delivery of emergency and other city services; and
(3)
The integrity of the city-wide drainage system may be affected by the failure, refusal or inability of individual property owners to deal with situations that create adverse conditions either upstream or downstream.
(d)
While some of these unsatisfactory conditions exist on private property, they may have adverse implications on both public and other private property.
(e)
From time to time, situations arise for which sufficient justification exists for the city to participate in resolving or ameliorating the adverse conditions.
(f)
The mayor and council find that an analytical process may be designed to enable the staff to identify those conditions that warrant action by or the participation of the city, and that the utilization of such process should ensure that the city funds are not utilized to improve private property in those circumstances where legitimate public interests do not exist.
The sections set out in this chapter are enacted in reliance upon these findings.
(Ord. No. 91-002, 4-15-91, ¶ 1)
Sec. 5-3-2. - Drainage improvements on public right-of-way.
The director of public works shall have the authority to improve drainage structures on public right-of-way immediately adjacent to public streets under the following conditions:
(1)
The drainage structure is working improperly resulting in an actual or threatened public safety hazard; or
(2)
If both of the above conditions do not exist, and if the adjoining property requests improvement:
a.
Provided the adjoining property owner agrees to furnish at his or her own expense all required materials, including but not limited to pipe, concrete, grates, blocks, grass, seed and fertilizer; and
b.
Provided installation of the improvement would not, in the judgment of the director, increase the likelihood of a drainage system malfunction either upstream or downstream; and
c.
Provided sufficient funds have been budgeted to complete such repairs and also carry on all other budgeted functions of the department.
Then the director may use city labor and equipment to complete such repairs provided that the projected expense for the use of such equipment and the cost of such labor does not exceed an amount established by the governing body from time to time in a separate ordinance. Requests for improvements with a projected equipment and labor expense in excess of the amount established by the governing body shall be approved individually by the governing body on a case by case basis.
(Ord. No. 91-002, 4-15-91, ¶ 2; Ord. No. 08-11, § 13, 3-17-2008)
Sec. 5-3-3. - Drainage improvements on nonpublic property.
(a)
The city of Forest Park cannot use public funds to improve private property. However, as a consequence of the conditions delineated by section 5-3-1, the mayor and council may approve, at their sole discretion, the utilization of the city assets to ameliorate existing or potential public safety hazards.
(b)
The following provisions shall control the exercise of discretion by the mayor and council:
(1)
No affirmative obligation shall exist, nor should one be construed to be created, to address all drainage failures or malfunctions in the city. The mayor and council retain sole discretion to determine if the costs to the city are justified by a corresponding benefit to the public.
(2)
No improvements, installations, modifications or repairs shall be performed by the city unless the property owner thereof shall agree in advance to furnish at his or her expense all materials, supplies, studies or reports, including, but not limited to, surveys and legal expenses.
(3)
The property owner shall execute in advance of any work all legal documents deemed necessary by the city including a release and indemnification.
(4)
The department of public works shall prepare and submit a report based on the criteria outlined in section 5-3-4 for consideration by the mayor and council. Based upon this report, the mayor and council may approve, disapprove or approve with modifications the proposed project.
(Ord. No. 91-002, 4-15-91, ¶ 2)
Sec. 5-3-4. - Report by the department of public works.
(a)
For each request for drainage improvements on nonpublic property, the department of public works shall prepare for consideration by the mayor and council a report of feasibility and necessity based upon the following criteria:
(1)
What, if any structure, public improvements or persons remain at risk without the proposed project;
(2)
Is the proposed project designed to prevent or lessen flooding and consequential destruction of private or public property that might occur under normal rainfall conditions;
(3)
Are the existing flooding conditions and consequential destruction of property limited to the property of the owner or are they also expanding or contain the potential to expand onto adjoining public or private property;
(4)
What potential public health and safety risks would be reduced by the project;
(5)
Is the project to be performed for purely aesthetic purposes;
(6)
Is the project designed to address only astatic movement of a creek or drainage ditch;
(7)
Is the proposed project likely to positively affect, adversely affect or neutrally affect upstream and downstream drainage;
(8)
What is the projected costs to the city;
(9)
Has the project been made necessary as a consequence of the negligence or inattention of the owner of the property and could it have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable diligence by the property owner.

CHAPTER 4. - STORMWATER UTILITY ORDINANCE[1]

Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 06-15, § I, adopted Apr. 3, 2006, amended the former Title 5, Ch. 4, §§ 5-4-1—5-4-14, and enacted a new Title 5, Ch. 4 as set out herein. The former Title 5, Ch. 4 pertained to stormwater management for new development and redevelopment. Formerly, Ord. No. 04-18, § 1, adopted Mar. 30, 2004, deleted the former Title 5, Ch. 4 in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Title 5, Ch. 4 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 95-002, § 1 adopted Apr. 3, 1995.

Sec. 5-4-1. - Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "City of Forest Park Stormwater Utility Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 06-15, § I, 4-3-2006)
Sec. 5-4-2. Findings.
The mayor and city council make the following findings:
(a)
Stormwater management is needed throughout the City of Forest Park. While specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community.
(b)
Addressing the stormwater management needs in the City of Forest Park is essential to protecting the public's health, safety, and welfare. Provisioning of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways.
(c)
Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding, streambank and ditch erosion, property damage and degradation of water quality, aquatic habitat and biological communities. Failure to manage these impacts can put the city's ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk.
(d)
The volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property, therefore, the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees.
(e)
Clayton County, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Lake City, Lovejoy, Morrow, and Riverdale, presently own and operate stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems in Clayton County in concert with the management of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, there must be adequate and stable funding for Clayton County's stormwater management program's operating needs and capital.
(f)
The feasibility report submitted to the county, cities, and Clayton County Water Authority (CCWA) properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities of the stormwater utility.
(g)
As a result, the city's governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and the city's governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the City of Forest Park.
(Ord. No. 06-15, § I, 4-3-2006)
Sec. 5-4-3. - Definitions.
The following definitions shall apply to this chapter. Any word or phrase not defined below, but otherwise defined in the Code of Ordinances, shall be given that meaning. All other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise.
Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by a property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater official in accordance with the stormwater utility.
Customer shall mean all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed.
Detached dwelling unit shall mean developed land containing one (1) structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one (1) or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one (1) family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one (1) or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by persons or entities other than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties.
Developed land means real property which has been altered from its "natural" state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than two hundred (200) square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this chapter upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued.
Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property.
Impervious surfaces shall mean those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious surfaces" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development.
Multi-family residential shall mean developed land where more than one (1) attached or detached residential dwelling units are located, including, but not limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which more than one family group commonly and normally reside or could reside.
Service charges shall mean the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by CCWA Stormwater Utility. The charge shall be used to fund the City of Forest Park Stormwater Utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by CCWA.
Single-family residential shall mean a developed lot containing one (1) dwelling structure with its principal use being residential.
Stormwater development guidelines are those guidelines established by CCWA which specify approved design criteria, construction materials, and construction methods for components of the stormwater management system.
Stormwater management system means any one (1) or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets, collection, or drainage.
Stormwater official is the CCWA General Manager or their appointee, who has direct responsibility for the management of the CCWA Stormwater Utility.
Stormwater unit (SU) shall mean the unit of measurement which provides the basis for comparing the runoff generated by customer's developed land with that generated by another's. An SU shall be the average impervious coverage of a statistical sampling of single-family residential lots in City of Forest Park. A stormwater unit has been determined through engineering and analysis to be two thousand nine hundred fifty (2,950) square feet of impervious surface. This unit will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the CCWA Stormwater Utility.

Sec. 5-5-2. - Findings.
new
It is hereby determined that:
Discharges to the City of Forest Park separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the City of Forest Park separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial, or institutional establishments.
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters.
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the City of Forest Park separate storm sewer system;
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the City of Forest Park separate storm sewer system;
Therefore, the City of Forest Park adopts this chapter to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the City of Forest Park separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the City of Forest Park separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.
