ARTICLE S. - RESIDENTIAL RENTAL DWELLING UNIT INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

Sec. 8-2-300. - Findings and purpose.
The city council finds and declares that there exist in the city substandard, and/or unsanitary residential rental buildings and dwelling units, the physical conditions, and characteristics of which violate state and local building, housing and sanitation codes and ordinances and render them unfit or unsafe for human occupancy and habitation. These residential rental buildings and units are detrimental to or jeopardize the health, safety, and welfare of their occupants and of the public and serve to seriously compromise the integrity and residential quality of city neighborhoods. It has been observed by city staff performing code enforcement functions that in general the most egregious violations of health and safety codes and negative impacts because of such factors as deferred property maintenance, a proliferation of vehicles attributable to the tenants who rent these properties and the accumulation of excess trash and debris on or about the properties.
The city council further finds and declares that the existence of such substandard residential rental buildings and dwelling units necessitates disproportionate expenditures of public funds for code enforcement and remedial action; impairs the efficient and economical exercise of governmental powers and functions; and disrupts peaceful and quiet enjoyment of residential areas and neighborhoods.
The city council further finds and declares the desire to maintain and safeguard the stock of decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing units in the city through a partnership of owners, tenants, the city, and the community.
The residential rental inspection program required by this section is intended to address the conditions described in the findings and purpose of this section. The purpose of this section is to proactively identify such substandard and unsafe residential buildings and dwelling units and to ensure the rehabilitation or elimination of those buildings and dwelling units that do not meet minimum building code and housing code standards or are not safe to occupy or do not comply with zoning codes. It is intended that structures will be required to be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition at the level consistent with the codes of the period in which they were constructed. However, unpermitted additions and alterations must comply with current codes adopted by the City of Forest Park.
It is not the city's intent to intrude upon the fair and accepted contractual relationship between tenant and property owner. The city does not intend to intervene as an advocate of either party, or to be receptive to the complaints of a tenant or property owner not specifically and clearly relevant to the provisions of this division. In the absence of such relevancy regarding tenant disputes, it is intended that the contracting parties exercise such legal rights as are available to them without the intervention of the city.
The provisions of this article are in addition to, not in lieu of, other applicable standard codes, but not limited to, International Property Maintenance Code, International Building Code, and International Fire Code, as adopted by the city.
