Interior FOG interceptors shall be easily accessible with a minimum clearance of 36 inches. Interior FOG interceptors are prohibited in all new development and redevelopment construction projects.
(e)
Interior and exterior FOG interceptor records. All food service establishments shall maintain records of the date and time of all cleaning and maintenance. Every FOG interceptor manifest shall be placed in a logbook, folder, or three-ring binder notebook. This book shall be made available on demand by the city administrator during inspection.

If entry is refused, the inspector shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law for entry and may include immediate revocation of water service. In the event of an emergency involving actual or imminent sanitary sewer overflow, the inspector may access adjoining businesses or properties that share a sewer system with a food service establishment in order to prevent or remediate an actual or imminent sewer overflow.
