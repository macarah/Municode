Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the city council in enacting the following regulations is to allow Vienna citizens the right to keep and raise backyard chickens in single-family residential zoning districts (R-1, R-1MH and A-R) in the city. Further, the city council finds it appropriate to regulate backyard chicken raising in the manner presented in this section, so as to be permissive enough to easily allow citizens to keep chickens on their property, but restrictive enough to protect the interests of neighboring residents from unnecessary noise, odor, and the invitation of rodents, wild birds and predatory animals to the property. Additionally, these regulations are intended to ensure the humane treatment of animals.
