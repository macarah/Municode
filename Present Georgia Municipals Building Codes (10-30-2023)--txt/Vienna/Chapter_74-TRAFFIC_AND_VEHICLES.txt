ARTICLE IV. - WRECKER QUALIFICATIONS/ROTATION LISTS

Sec. 74-131. - Purpose.
(a)
To establish a policy that will govern how the wrecker rotation will be maintained.
(b)
To describe criteria by which wrecker service operators should govern themselves while conducting business within the city limits of Vienna.
(c)
To ensure that wrecker companies utilized by the City of Vienna Police Department use and maintain safe roadworthy recovery vehicles.
(d)
To specify the minimum required equipment for wrecker services utilized by the police department.
(e)
To identify procedures for suspension of a wrecker service from a police department wrecker list.
(Ord. of 12-14-15(1))
Sec. 74-132. - Policy.
It is the intent of the police department to utilize those wrecker services that desire to participate in business generated by the department. For purposes of this policy, a "wrecker service" means any wrecker company, corporation or business, including owner(s) and operator(s). An owner or part owner may not have more than one wrecker service appear on a single police department wrecker rotation list. The chief of police will establish and maintain a wrecker rotation list with Middle Flint Regional E911, except where exempt, which will insure that each service maintained on the department's wrecker list receives its fair share of requests. An owner or part-owner of a wrecker service business may not have more than one business appear on a single Department wrecker rotation list.
Those outside the department judge the department by the manner in which it conducts itself. With this in mind, the department is concerned with the conduct of those who operate in concert with it. It is therefore imperative that wrecker services utilized by the department conduct themselves in a professional manner, providing competent service at a reasonable and fair cost to the public, while complying with state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.
This policy governs the manner and method by which members of the police department may secure the services of a wrecker operator to tow and store vehicles upon the request of the owner/operator or as otherwise required by law. This policy and the acceptance of a wrecker service's application there under, shall not be construed as a contract or other form of agreement. All liability and responsibility for payment for the services of the wrecker service shall lie with the owner/operator, and neither the State of Georgia, the City of Vienna Police Department, nor any member of the City of Vienna Police Department are responsible for payment therefore.
This policy is created as a procedure for the police department and is created for the benefit of its members to assist in operations. This policy is not intended to create any benefit for any wrecker service or wrecker owner or operators of any wrecker service. This policy neither creates nor establishes any right owed nor does it create any legal duty owed to any wrecker service of its owners or operators.
(Ord. of 12-14-15(1))

(d)
Wrecker rotation procedures: police department rules:

If the use of the wrecker service requested by the owner/operator would result in an excessive delay to the officer in the execution of their duties, the officer may exercise the option of using the next wrecker service on the police department wrecker rotation list.

In an emergency situation, involving significant threat to life or property, the officer may utilize the closest equipment or services necessary to stabilize the situation.
