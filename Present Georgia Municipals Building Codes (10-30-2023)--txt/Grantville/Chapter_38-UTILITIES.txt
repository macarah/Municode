Single directional metering.
(1)
For kwh's generated by customer's distributed generation facility, customer shall be compensated at the city's avoided cost of energy (kwh) as determined by the city. The city will only compensate customer for avoided energy kwh's as determined by metered energy delivered to the city's distribution system.
(2)
The customer's net bill will be calculated using the city calculation for avoided energy cost (as described below) credited to the customer, netted against the billing period charges for the customer's regular service (according to the applicable tariff) based on actual metered energy.

Avoided energy cost. Payments by the city to the customer for the billing period metered avoided energy kwh's will be computed by the city in its sole discretion based on the average monthly wholesale market price as determined by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), the city's wholesale energy provider.
In the event customer develops a credit balance during a billing period, the amount will remain as a credit on the customer's account. Credit balances remaining at the end of the city's fiscal year will be cleared by the issuance of a check for the credit balance to customer. Any other clearance of account credit balances will be at the city's discretion.

Additional energy may be purchased by the city at its sole discretion at a cost agreed to by it and the customer provider. The city shall at no time be required to purchase energy from customers in excess of amounts required by the DG Act.
