Purposes of chapter. This chapter is adopted for providing the county with rules and regulations to improve public safety by promoting the control of fire hazards; regulating the installation, use, and maintenance of equipment; regulating the use of structures, premises, and open areas; providing for the abatement of fire hazards; establishing the responsibilities and procedures for code enforcement; and setting forth the standards for compliance and achievement of these objectives.
(b)
Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate this chapter, to permit or maintain such a violation, to refuse to obey any provision hereof, or to fail or refuse to comply with any such provision or regulation except as variation may be allowed by the action of the fire marshal in writing. Proof of such unlawful act or failure shall be deemed prima facie evidence that such act is that of the owner, occupant or other person in control of the premises. Prosecution or lack thereof of either the owner, occupant, or the person in charge shall not be deemed to relieve any of the others.
(c)
Enforcement generally. The fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services shall be responsible for the enforcement of the county fire prevention code. The fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services may assign qualified members of the fire department as inspectors as shall from time to time be necessary. To assist in the performance of the responsibilities and duties placed upon the fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services, a bureau of fire prevention in the fire department of the county is hereby created.
(d)
The bureau of fire prevention. The bureau of fire prevention shall operate under the supervision of the fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services. The fire chief of the fire department and/or the director of emergency services shall designate a fire official of the county fire department as fire marshal. The fire marshal shall be responsible for the direct administration and enforcement of the county fire prevention code as may be set forth by the fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services. The fire marshal shall be appointed on the basis of examination or other method for determining qualifications. The fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services may also designate such number of technical inspectors as shall from time to time be authorized by the board of commissioners. Such technical inspectors shall be selected through an examination to determine their fitness for the position.

Investigation of fires. The bureau of fire prevention shall investigate the cause, origin, and circumstances of every fire occurring in the county by which property has been destroyed or damaged and, so far as possible, shall determine whether the fire is the result of carelessness or design. Such investigation shall begin immediately upon the occurrence of such fire. The fire marshal shall take charge immediately of the physical evidence, shall notify the other authorities designated by law to pursue the investigation of such matters, and shall further cooperate with other agencies in the collection of evidence and in the prosecution of the case.
(h)
Inspections; orders. The fire marshal shall inspect or cause to be inspected all premises on a periodic basis, and shall make such orders as may be necessary for the enforcement of the laws and ordinances governing the same and for the safeguarding of life and property from fire, explosion and other hazards incident to the use and occupancy of buildings, structures, or premises.
(i)
Correction of unsafe conditions. Whenever any inspector, as defined above, shall find in any building, or upon any premises or other places, combustible or explosive matter or dangerous accumulations of rubbish or unnecessary accumulation of waste paper, boxes, shavings, or any highly flammable materials especially liable to fire, and which are so situated as to endanger property; or shall find obstructions to or on fire escapes, stairs, passageways, doors, or windows liable to interfere with operations of the fire department or egress of occupants in case of fire, the inspector shall order the same to be removed or remedied, and such order shall forthwith be complied with by the owner or occupant of such premises or buildings, subject to the appeals procedure provided for in the county fire prevention code.
(1)
Any owner or occupant failing to comply with such order within a reasonable period after the service of the order shall be liable to penalties as hereinafter provided.
(2)
The service of any such order may be made upon the occupant of the premises to whom it is directed, either by delivering a copy of same to such occupant personally, or leaving it with any person in charge of the premises, or, in case no such person is found upon the premises, by affixing a copy thereof in a conspicuous place on the door to the entrance of the premises. Whenever it may be necessary to serve such an order upon the owner of premises, such order may be served either by delivering to and leaving with such person a copy of the order, or, if such owner is absent from the jurisdiction of the officer making the order, by mailing such copy by certified mail to the owner's last known post office address.

The fire marshal shall compile and keep a record of all fires and of all the facts concerning the same, including injuries, deaths, rescues of persons, and statistics as to the extent of such fires and the damage caused thereby, and whether such losses were covered by insurance, and if so, in what amount.
(k)
Annual report. The fire marshal shall make an annual report of the activities of the bureau of fire prevention and shall transmit this report to the chief executive officer and/or the county administrator through the fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services. This report shall contain all proceedings under the county fire prevention code with such statistics as the fire chief and/or the director of emergency services may wish to include therein.
(l)
Amendments. The fire chief of the county fire department and/or the director of emergency services or the fire marshal shall also recommend any amendments to the county fire prevention code or ordinance which shall be desirable.

ARTICLE VI. - MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL SPRINKLER CODE

Sec. 12-150. - Scope.
This standard deals with the design and installation of automatic sprinkler systems for protection against fire hazards in residential occupancies up to four stories in height. Residential occupancies falling under the scope of this standard include apartment buildings, lodging and rooming houses, residential board and care facilities, hotels, dormitories, personal care, and residential board and care occupancies.
(Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 2-12-2015)
Sec. 12-151. - Purpose.
The purpose of this standard is to provide design and installation requirements for an automatic fire sprinkler system to aid in the detection and control of fires in residential occupancies and thus provide improved protection against injury, life loss, and property damage. A sprinkler system designed and installed in accordance with this standard is expected to prevent flashover (total involvement) in the room of fire origin, when sprinklered, and to improve the chance for occupants to escape or be evacuated. Nothing in this standard is intended to restrict new technologies or alternate arrangements, providing that the level of safety prescribed by the standard is not lowered.
