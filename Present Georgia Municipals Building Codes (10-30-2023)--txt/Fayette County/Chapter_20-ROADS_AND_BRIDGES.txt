(b)
Roadway or street lighting luminaries or fixtures installed within public rights-of-way as "security lights," or for the purpose of lighting areas other than the public street or roadway shall be mounted on the side of the pole opposite from such street or roadway and shall be oriented in such a manner to insure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street, and the vertical light distribution, at the initial light source, is perpendicular to the street, so as to protect the users of the street from objectionable glare. The approval of the environmental management department shall be obtained before installation of such lighting fixtures.
(c)
Other lighting fixtures to be installed within or outside of public rights-of-way for any purpose shall be installed and operated in such a manner as to prevent glare from being a hazard to or interfering with the normal use of the public right-of-way.
(Ord. No. 2014-18, § 1, 11-13-2014)
Sec. 20-72. - Installation and operation.

Plans and specifications for the proposed installation indicating compliance with these standards shall be submitted to the environmental management department for approval. No installation shall be allowed without this approval.
(2)
Fixtures for illuminating areas adjoining public streets or roadways, such as parking areas, driveways, easements, etc., shall be mounted in such a manner as to ensure that the lighting pattern is kept off the public street or roadway. When street or roadway lighting luminaries are to be used for "security lighting," they shall be mounted on the side of the pole that is opposite from the public street or roadway and shall be mounted to ensure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street or roadway and the vertical light distribution at the initial light source is perpendicular to the street or roadway.
(3)
If lighting fixtures of a type other than those in the classification of street or roadway luminaries are to be used or if the proposed lighting is to be for other than driveways, parking areas, or other similar areas, the plans and specifications submitted shall be sufficiently detailed to clearly indicate that such a proposal is in compliance with these standards and shall not cause a hazard to or interfere with the normal use of the public street or roadway.
