Sec. 102-461. - Application to residential code.
The provisions of this article apply to the International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings, as adopted in section 102-22. In this article the term "residential code" means the International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings as adopted in section 102-22.
(Code 1992, § 5-201; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 4, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-462. - Scope.
The provisions of the International Residential Code for One- and Two-Family Dwellings shall apply to the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, removal and demolition of detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses not more than three stories above grade in height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures.
(Code 1992, § 5-202; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 4, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-463. - Purpose.
The purpose of the residential code is to provide minimum requirements to safeguard the public safety, health and general welfare through affordability, structural strength, means of egress facilities, stability, sanitation, light and ventilation, energy conservation and safety to life and property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment. The purpose of the residential code is not to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefitted by the terms of the residential code.
(Code 1992, § 5-203; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 4, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-464. - Public duty, warranty and quality control.
The permitting, plans examination or inspection conducted with regard to a building or structure in accordance with the residential code constitutes a public duty and does not warrant or ensure the absence of any hazard, deficiency or other matter. Any duty created by or based on the residential code is transferred to the public, and no private cause of action is created by a breach of such duty. The residential code shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person, firm or corporation owning, operating or controlling any building or structure for any damages to persons or property caused by defects, nor shall the department of building safety or the county be held as assuming any such liability by reason of the inspections or plans examinations authorized by the residential code or any permits or certificates issued under the residential code. The building official checks for substantial compliance with the residential code, but reviews and inspections performed by the building official pursuant to this chapter do not create any guarantee or warranty that buildings, structures or service equipment have been constructed in accordance with all provisions of the residential code. The permitting, plans examination, or inspection of any building, structure, system, element, or construction document shall not be construed as a warranty of the physical condition or adequacy of such building, structure, system, element, or construction document, including, without limitation, a representation or warranty that a building or structure is complete, that it is in compliance with the residential code or any other law, that it was inspected, that it is safe or ready for occupancy or that it meets any particular degree of quality or workmanship. Quality control of materials and workmanship is not within the purview of the residential code except as it relates to the purposes stated therein. The amount and quality of inspection and other services provided is discretionary with the building official and may vary in response to the amount of staff, work load, training and experience, funding and other pertinent factors affecting whether and how inspection is made or whether any hazard, deficiency or similar matter is observed.
(Code 1992, § 5-204; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 4, 12-14-2006)
Sec. 102-465. - Existing structures.

(b)
Additions, alterations or repairs. Additions, alterations or repairs to any structure shall conform to the requirements for a new structure without requiring the existing structure to comply with all of the requirements of the residential code, unless otherwise stated. Additions, alterations or repairs shall not cause an existing structure to become unsafe or adversely affect the performance of the building.
(Code 1992, § 5-205; Ord. No. 2006-16, § 4, 12-14-2006)
