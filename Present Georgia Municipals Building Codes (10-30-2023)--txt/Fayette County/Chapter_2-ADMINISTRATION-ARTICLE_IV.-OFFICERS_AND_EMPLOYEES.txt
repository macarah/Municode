Sec. 2-163. - Purpose.
The board of commissioners of the county finds that the manufacture, distribution, sale, use, or possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs in an unlawful manner is a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. The board of commissioners further finds that the use of alcohol during or prior to working hours is prohibited where alcohol can be measured at the level of 0.02 grams during working hours, said level being presumptively adverse to the safety of the workplace. It is declared to be a primary purpose and goal of this county, and of all of its public officials and employees to take all reasonable steps possible to eradicate the unlawful manufacture, distribution, sale, use, and possession of controlled substances, marijuana, and other dangerous drugs; and further to take all reasonable steps to eradicate the use of alcohol where a level of 0.02 grams exists, such level adversely affecting the safety of the workplace. With this purpose in mind, the board of commissioners declares that its work force must be absolutely free of any person who would knowingly manufacture, distribute, sell, use, or possess a controlled substance, marijuana, or a dangerous drug in an unlawful manner; and from any person whose use of alcohol results in a level of 0.02 grams during working hours. For this reason, and pursuant to the Drug-Free Public Work Force Act of 1990 (O.C.G.A. § 45-23-1 et seq.), the board of commissioners of the county enacts this article.
