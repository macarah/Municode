(c)
Method of calculation.

The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this article shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the city, and may be amended from time to time by official act.
(4)
In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element.

In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then:
a.
The administrator in his or her reasonable discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use category and the appropriate development impact fee.
b.
In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the land use categories shown on the adopted fee schedule.
c.
If the land use of the proposed development is not similar to a land use category shown on the adopted fee schedule, then an appropriate fee may be determined by the administrator as an individual assessment in accordance with the individual assessment determinations section of this article.

For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property, whichever is earliest.
(3)
If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to collect a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the following:

b.
In the event that the actual land use or uses and/or the actual gross square footage applicable to the actual land use or uses differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the impact fee applicable to the actual land use or uses and/or gross square footage exceeds the impact fee previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a condition to the issuance of an interior finishes permit or a certificate of occupancy.
c.
The amount of the excess shall be based upon the impact fee schedule in effect on the date the interior finishes permit or the certificate of occupancy is issued.
d.
If the actual gross square footage constructed after the issuance of the building permit is less than the amount originally certified, the developer shall be entitled to a refund of the excess portion of the fee in accordance with this article.
(4)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the original building permit shall result in the assessment of such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the original building permit.
(c)
Individual assessment determinations. An individual assessment of development impact fees for a particular property or proposed use may be established as follows:
(1)
At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment A.
(2)
In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. The individual assessment study shall:
a.
Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or,
b.
Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the city or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to an accepted professional methodology.
(3)
The applicant shall provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination.
(4)
The administrator in his or her reasonable discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this article.

The failure to periodically review such data shall not invalidate this article.

A copy of any applicable written decision or determination made by the administrator (from which the appeal is taken).

(4)
Appeals from the final decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council within 30 days of the administrator's final decision.

Refusal of written notice of violation, stop work order or citation under this article shall constitute legal notice of service. The citation shall be in the form of a written official notice issued in person or by certified mail to the owner of the property, or to his or her agent, or to the person performing the work giving rise to such violation. The receipt of a citation shall require that corrective action be taken within 30 days unless otherwise extended at the discretion of the administrator.

(Ord. of 1-8-2019(1))
Sec. 18-233. - Repealer, severability, and effective date.
