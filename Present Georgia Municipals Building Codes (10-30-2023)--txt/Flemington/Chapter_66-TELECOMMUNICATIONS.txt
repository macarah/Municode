Sec. 66-21. - Applicability.
(a)
Generally. Except as set forth in section 66-21(c), the provisions, requirements and limitations of this article shall govern the location of all wireless telecommunication, cellular telecommunication, television, microwave, radio, or similar transmission towers or antennas installed within the jurisdiction of the city council. The provisions, requirements and limitations of this article shall only apply to wireless telecommunication, cellular telecommunication, television, microwave, radio, or similar transmission towers or antennas installed within the jurisdiction of the city council. In addition, any provisions, requirements or limitations contained elsewhere within the zoning ordinance of the city, set forth in appendix A to this Code, which directly conflict with the administration of this article or the provisions, requirements or limitations hereof, shall be inapplicable to this article.
(b)
Governmental exemption. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this article, the provisions of this article shall not apply to the city council's properties, facilities or structures. Private facilities and structures placed upon the city council's property shall be governed by a lease agreement or similar instrument between the city council and the provider.
(c)
Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This article shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is 75 feet or less in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator from the operator's residence, or is used exclusively as a receive-only antenna; provided, however, only one such tower or antenna per residence shall be excluded from this article.
(d)
Preexisting towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall not be required to meet the provisions of this article, other than section 66-22(i)—(k) and section 66-27, and the requirements of section 66-22(d) (except subsection (d)(6)), (f) and (g)) within six months from the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this article as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting antennas;" provided, however, that the placement of antennas on any nonconforming structure shall not create a vested right for the continued use of the structures should the nonconforming use cease. If an additional antenna is collocated upon a preexisting tower after adoption of this article, then the requirements of section 66-22(d) (except subsection (d)(6)), (f) and (g)) shall be met as part of the permitting process.
(Ord. No. 2000-1, § I(1.3), 10-3-2000)
Sec. 66-22. - General provisions.
(a)
Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure.
(b)
Collocation; design requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the collocation of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following:
(1)
For towers up to 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater;
(2)
For towers greater than 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater.
(c)
Collocation; availability of suitable existing structures. No new tower, except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the administrator and/or city council (as the case may be) that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of the following:
(1)
That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area which will allow for the effective operation of the proposed antenna (as informed by industry standards);
(2)
That existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to allow for the effective operation of the proposed antenna (as informed by industry standards);
(3)
That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment (as informed by industry standards);
(4)
That the applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antennas on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna, and such interference cannot be effectively remedied;
(5)
That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing substantially exceed the cost and requirements of new tower development and are otherwise entirely unreasonable;
(6)
That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable, other than economic reasons.
(d)
Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article.
(1)
Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(2)
At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be concealed from public view by using landscaping and materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
(3)
For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive.
(4)
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from sunset to sunrise.
(5)
No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within the city.
(6)
To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the city council or by any state or federal law or agency.
(7)
Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land so as to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area.
(8)
Such other additional requirements as the administrator and/or city council, as the case may be, shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area.
(e)
Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers:
(1)
Towers shall be set back a minimum distance equal to the height of the tower from its base to any public right-of-way or occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower unless the owner of the adjoining property whose property is within the fall zone otherwise consents in writing.
(2)
Guy wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements.
(3)
Towers shall not be located closer than 5,280 feet from any existing tower; provided, however, that the administrator or city council may waive this requirement when it is determined that the placement of another tower within said 5,280 feet is technologically required or visually preferable. This requirement shall not apply to amateur radio towers.
(f)
Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chainlink, wood or other approved alternative.
(g)
Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers:
(1)
Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and eight feet in height at planting and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound.
(2)
Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
(3)
Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the administrator to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this article.
Amateur radio towers and antennas or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to this subsection unless specifically required by the city council by virtue of other provisions of the zoning ordinance of the city.
(h)
Maintenance impact. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible.
(i)
Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee, owner or the lessee of the tower and/or antenna governed by this article shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and/or antenna and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the city council shall be in the manner provided by section 5-84 of the Code of Ordinances of Liberty County, Georgia, governing unsafe or abandoned structures.
(j)
Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the administrator concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in section 5-84 of the Code of Ordinances of Liberty County, Georgia, governing unsafe or abandoned structures. Prior to the removal of any tower, the administrator may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the compliance period referenced in this subsection.
(k)
Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of an ownership interest in any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the administrator of the transaction in writing within 30 days.

Such other considerations as may be implicated by the provisions of this article.
(f)
Requirements for issuance of conditional use permit. The conditional use permit may be issued by the city council only upon satisfaction of the following requirements:
(1)
A proper application filed in accordance with the requirements of section 66-23;
(2)
The application is otherwise in compliance with the conditions for the proposed conditional use required by this section;
(3)
The applicant complies with the conditions imposed by the city council for the purpose of reducing the harmful effects of the use on surrounding uses and ensuring compatibility with surrounding uses;
(4)
The city council determines that the benefits and need for the proposed conditional use are greater than any possible depreciating effects or damages to neighboring or nearby properties; and
(5)
All fees and other expenses required have been paid in full.
(g)
Independent expert review. The administrator or city council may engage a licensed professional engineer or other qualified industry professional as an independent expert to review any of the materials submitted by an applicant for a conditional use permit and render an opinion regarding any concerns about the proposal, including, but not limited to, structural integrity and the feasibility of alternative sites or collocation; provided, however, that prior to seeking the review of an independent expert, the zoning administrator or city council shall convey its concerns to the applicant in writing and shall allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to address those concerns. If the applicant is unable to address those concerns to the satisfaction of the administrator or city council, the applicant shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days, following the receipt of the letter to such effect, in which to modify the application to alleviate the administrator's or city council's concerns or withdraw the application altogether. If the applicant fails to so modify or withdraw the application within the required time, the administrator or city council may proceed to engage a licensed professional engineer to conduct the independent expert review and the expert's reasonable fees, costs and expenses shall be paid by the applicant; provided that the administrator or city council shall give the applicant written notice of its intent to do so. The expert's opinion shall not necessarily be determinative, but shall be a significant factor to be considered in granting or denying the application. No permit shall be issued until the applicant has paid all such fees, costs and expenses incurred under this section.
(h)
Resubmittal of conditional use application. An application for a conditional use permit which has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of six months, and then only if the applicant can document a substantial change in need for a tower or antenna at the same location.
