Sec. 2-8-7. - Smoking in county facilities.
The United States Surgeon General recently reported that exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke may cause significant health risks to nonsmokers; and, many allergic individuals and healthy nonsmokers report discomfort when exposed to secondhand smoke on the job. The county recognizes the need to strike a reasonable balance between the needs of person who smoke and the rights of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air. Therefore, be it resolved, that in all facilities owned and/or occupied by county employees and agents, the following restrictions regarding smoking shall apply:
(1)
Smoking will be permitted only in designated smoking areas. Areas in which smoking will not be permitted shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
a.
Employee work areas, except as noted in subsection (2) of this section.
b.
Employee break rooms, lounges, snack bars and restrooms, except as noted in subsection (2) of this section.
c.
Conference and meeting rooms, auditoriums, courtrooms and other public assembly chambers.
d.
Elevators and hallways with a single entrance and egress.
(2)
Smoking will be permitted in the following areas:
a.
Private offices, provided said offices have floor-to-ceiling walls and doors remain closed while smoking.
b.
Lobbies and connecting hallways.
c.
Designated employee break rooms, in building where space permits.
(3)
"No Smoking" signs shall be placed conspicuously in county facilities to serve as a directive to employees and the general public. Georgia law (O.C.G.A. Section 16-12-2) prohibits smoking in areas clearly marked by "No Smoking" signs.
(4)
In all cases the rights of nonsmokers to protect their health will take precedence over persons who desire to smoke. Voluntary compliance with these policies is desired. However, violation of these policies by employees may subject them to disciplinary action under provisions of the county personnel policies. Members of the public who smoke in restricted areas will be asked to comply with these policies by extinguishing all smoking materials. Persons refusing to extinguish smoking materials will be escorted from the building by appropriate law enforcement officials.

Secs. 2-8-13—2-8-20. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION

Sec. 2-8-21. - Statement of purpose.
The purpose of the ordinance, hereinafter referred to as the "article", is to ensure protection of the community's groundwater supply.
All local governments must adopt protection measures when their jurisdiction contains any part of a significant groundwater recharge area. These areas are identified in Hydrologic Atlas 18: Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia.
Protection required within the significant recharge areas is further refined (rated high, medium or low), based upon local susceptibility to human induced pollution. These ratings are illustrated in Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.
More than ninety-nine (99) percent of Dougherty County is identified as a significant groundwater recharge area with high susceptibility to pollution. Since contamination plumes have been identified in the county's groundwater and pollution susceptibility cannot be mapped with absolute accuracy, the entire county will be treated as a significant groundwater recharge area with high susceptibility to pollution.
(Res. No. 99-024, § 1, 6-21-99)
Sec. 2-8-22. - Jurisdiction.
This article shall apply within the unincorporated area of Dougherty County.
(Res. No. 99-024, § 2, 6-21-99)
Sec. 2-8-23. - Applicability of other code or regulatory requirements.
If any provision or requirement of this article is found to be in conflict with any other provision or requirement of this article or of any other applicable governmental law, resolution, rule or other governmental regulation of any kind, the regulation which establishes the more restrictive rule or higher standard shall govern.
(Res. No. 99-024, § 3, 6-21-99)
Sec. 2-8-24. - Definitions.
(a)
Aquifer means any stratum or zone or rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well.
(b)
DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA 600/2-87-035. (Note: the DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluation of pollution susceptibility).
(c)
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
(d)
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
(e)
Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
(f)
Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped as such by the Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Recharge areas in Dougherty County include surface outcroppings of the extensively used Floridan aquifer, karst topography and soils having high permeability, according to the 1976 1:750,000 Soils Association Map of Georgia.
(Res. No. 99-024, § 4, 6-21-99)

New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of six hundred sixty (660) gallons, shall have secondary containment for one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of such tanks or one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. (Note: These figures are consistent with US EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1).
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10-7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. (The average size of existing agricultural waste impoundments in Georgia is about fifteen (15) acre-feet; sheeps-foot rollers or pans with heavy rubber tires, which are normal equipment for most Georgia earth moving contractors, should be able to compact clay to the recommended vertical hydraulic conductivity.)
(e)
New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter "DHR Table MT-1"). One hundred fifty (150) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1, because Dougherty County is a high pollution susceptibility area.
(f)
New mobile home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter "DHR Table MT-2"). One hundred fifty (150) percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2, because Dougherty County is a high pollution susceptibility area.
(g)
For multifamily residential dwelling, all other nonsingle-family dwellings and commercial properties, the maximum allowable rate of sewage flow per unit of land shall be one hundred fifty (150) percent of the minimum lot size of Table MT-2 because Dougherty County is a high pollution susceptibility area.
(h)
If Dougherty County, or the Dougherty County Health Department requires a larger lot size than that required by (f) above for homes or by (g) above for mobile homes, the larger lot size shall be used.
(i)
Any lot of record in Dougherty County, on the date of the adoption of these lot size standards, is exempt from the size requirements of (f) or (g) or (h), provided all other provisions of applicable regulations are met.
(j)
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the Dougherty County Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Rules of the Department of Human Resources Chapter 290-5-26 Onsite Sewage Management Systems, the accompanying DHR Manual and (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) above.
(k)
The Southwest Georgia Regional Development Center is responsible for considering, in its regional plan, the cumulative environmental effects of a significant number of septic tank systems being used in close proximity to each other. In so considering, the regional development center shall not approve any local plans that would result in adverse environmental effects on another area. The Southwest Georgia Regional Development Center may consult with the Department of Human Resources and the Department of Natural Resources for technical assistance as to appropriate densities of lots served by septic tanks in significant recharge areas.
(l)
New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of types and in amounts determined by the Department of Natural Resources, shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems, as prescribed by the Department of Natural Resources.

Sec. 2-8-42. - Nuisance abatement procedure.
(a)
Appointment and designation of public officer. The director of the Albany-Dougherty Planning and Development Services Department, or his or her designee and the director of public works or his or her designee, are hereby appointed and designated as a public officer with authority to carry out the powers and duties of this article.
(b)
Complaint and investigation. Whenever a request is filed with a public officer by a public authority or by at least five (5) residents of the unincorporated area of Dougherty County charging that any property:
(1)
Is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; or
(2)
Is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(3)
Constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions;
the public officer with whom the request is filed shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific property to determine if such conditions exist under applicable codes. The public officer shall have the authority to enter upon premises to conduct an inspection, provided such entry is made with the least possible inconvenience to the person(s) in possession. If such an inspection is necessary, the public officer shall endeavor to obtain the permission of the owner to conduct such inspection. If permission is withheld, the public officer may seek the assistance of the county attorney's office to obtain an inspection warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. The public officer may determine that the property is being used in the commission of drug crimes upon personal observation or report of a law enforcement agency.
(c)
Judicial complaint and summons. If the public officer's investigation or inspection confirms that any property meets one (1) or more of the three (3) enumerated standards from subsection (b), the public officer may file in a court of competent jurisdiction a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property wherein the nuisance complained of exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the parties in interest of such dwelling, building, or structure pursuant to the provisions of section 2-8-43. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance.
(d)
Time of hearing. The summons shall notify the parties in interest that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction at a date and time certain. Such hearing shall be held no sooner than fifteen (15) days and no later than forty-five (45) days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. However, in the event that service upon the probate judge is necessary under the provisions of section 2-8-43, the hearing will be held no sooner than thirty (30) days following service upon the probate judge, though still in no event shall the hearing be held more than forty-five (45) days after the filing of said complaint.
(e)
Right to be heard. The parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing.
(f)
Order. If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the property in question meets one (1) or more of the standards enumerated in subsection (b) so as to constitute a public nuisance, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order which does one (1) of the following:
(1)
If the repair of the said property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to its present value, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to repair such property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to effect a closing of any structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
(2)
If the repair of the said property in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value thereof, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to demolish and remove the noncompliant dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
For purposes of this section, in cases in which the nuisance complained of is a dwelling, building, or structure of any kind, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, qualified building contractors with a current business license to do work in the county, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations.
(g)
Remedies of public officer in the event of noncompliance with order.
(1)
The order entered under subsection (f) shall further provide that, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, demolish, or close the property within the specified time, the public officer may cause such property to be repaired, demolished, or closed, whichever the order required. The public officer is also authorized to file a motion for attachment for contempt against the owner with the court which issued the order as an alternate or additional remedy.
(2)
If the public officer chooses to have the work done as ordered on any dwelling building or structure, he or she shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words:
This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful.
(h)
Salvage. If the public officer has a structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Neither the public officer nor the county shall have any liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
(i)
Lien for costs. The order shall provide that the amount of all costs associated with the abatement action shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such costs shall include but not be limited to the cost of demolition, reasonable attorneys' fees and all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, restoration to grade of the real property should it be demolished, and title examination costs. The order should recite the amount of costs incurred by the county as of the date of the order. Upon preparing a final statement of costs, the public officer shall prepare a "lien for costs of abatement" detailing any and all such costs. Such Lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition, in the office of the clerk of superior court, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 2-8-43(b). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien for costs of abatement on the general execution docket. Such lien should cross-reference the order and include the original caption and case number from the nuisance abatement action. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the tax commissioner.
(j)
Enforcement of lien. It shall be the duty of the tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property; however, the tax commissioner shall be authorized to bill the amount of the lien as it comes due separately from the annual ad valorem tax bill in order to ensure prompt notice of the amount of the lien and so as to not interfere with the regular billing cycle of the annual ad valorem taxes. The tax commissioner shall have the full authority to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. section 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the general fund of the county. Thirty (30) days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
(k)
Waiver of lien. The board of commissioners may waive and release any such lien imposed on property of the owner for costs incurred by the county up to the time of the entry of the order and any additional costs incurred subsequent thereto in attempting to bring the property into compliance by entering into a contract with the owner in which the owner agrees to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.
(l)
Appellate procedure. Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. section 5-3-29.
(m)
Alternate remedies. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to limit or impair the authority of public officers or other county employees under existing and future resolutions to issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by resolutions, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and to seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section. The issuance of a citation for a violation of any such codes or resolutions shall not be required as a prerequisite to issuing a complaint in rem under this section.
