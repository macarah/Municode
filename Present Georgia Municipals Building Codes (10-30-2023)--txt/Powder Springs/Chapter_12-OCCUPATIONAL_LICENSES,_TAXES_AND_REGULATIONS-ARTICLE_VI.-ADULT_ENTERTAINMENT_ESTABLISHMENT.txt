The article was amended in its entirety by Ord. No. 92-13. In some cases, the new text duplicated the subject matter of existing sections; in those cases a complete history note has been given. In other cases, the existing subject has been retained, but the section number has changed; in those cases, a complete history note has been given, and a note has been included giving the former section number. Completely new material carries reference only to Ord. No. 92-13.
