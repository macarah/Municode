In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, Powder Springs shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the rate of one hundred twenty-five (125) percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment become delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in Powder Springs, of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax, all as provided by the ordinances and charter of the city and the laws of Georgia. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the officer of the city authorized by law to buy executions for delinquent taxes upon the property of defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs.
