Sec. 11-21. - Use of single meter.
(a)
Each separate customer and separate premises shall have a separate meter and a separate monthly bill. Water will not be supplied to more than one (1) house through a single meter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each tenement shall be considered a separate house and a meter required therefor. Meter readings shall not be consolidated for the same customer at different premises or for several customers on the same or different premises. For all commercial and office buildings where a sprinkler system is installed which requires a separate water main connection, a separate meter of a type specified by the public works director will be required for monitoring the flow.
(b)
The owner of buildings containing two (2) or more family dwelling units is prohibited from using a single water meter to service such units unless same is expressly provided by ordinance; no customer may permit water or wastewater service to be taken through his installation (water meter) into any other building or dwelling unit, whether owned by himself or another, or whether on his premises or elsewhere unless same is expressly provided by ordinance.
(c)
With written authorization from the public works director, the owner of buildings containing two (2) or more family dwelling units or an integrated complex of buildings containing the same may elect to use a single water meter ("master meter") to service such units, and if such election is made, the owner of such buildings will be responsible for payment of all water and wastewater services rendered to such buildings and units by the city. Further, the owner shall be responsible for all operation, maintenance, and replacement of water facilities on the user side of the master meter.
(d)
Installation of a subunit meter for each dwelling unit is required at the time of construction for all new multifamily buildings where master meters are utilized. Purchase and installation are responsibility of the owner. The owner is responsible for any billing of residents based on subunit meters and may charge tenants separately for water and wastewater service, provided that the total amount of the charges to the tenants of such a building shall not exceed the total charges paid by the owner or operator for water and wastewater service for such building plus a reasonable fee for establishing, servicing and billing for water and wastewater service and provided, further, that the terms of the charges are disclosed to the tenants prior to any contractual agreement.

(2)
Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making the test, provided, however, that if the meter is found to over-register beyond three (3) percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made.
