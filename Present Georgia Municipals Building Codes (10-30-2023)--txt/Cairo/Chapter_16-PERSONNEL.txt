All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them.

Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 724, adopted Nov. 8, 2010, repealed the former art. III, §§ 16-45—16-64, and enacted a new art. III as set out herein. The former art. III pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for a complete derivation.

Sec. 16-45. - Purpose.
The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his or her own private standing. The principle policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are:
(a)
The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.
(b)
The constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Cairo should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct.
(c)
The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others.
(d)
Elected officials should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their elected office.
(e)
All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality.
(f)
Those persons who fail to abide by the terms of this code of ethics should be disciplined.
(Ord. No. 724, § 1, 11-8-10)
Sec. 16-46. - Intent.
It is the intent of this code of ethics that any city official shall not knowingly engage in any activity which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or which would tend to impair his or her judgment or actions in the performance of his or her official duties. Furthermore, city officials should avoid any action which might result in or create the appearance of the following:
(a)
Using public office for private gain.
(b)
Impeding city efficiency or economy.
(c)
Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of those who conduct the affairs and business of the City of Cairo.
Not withstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the Charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This article shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the Charter.
