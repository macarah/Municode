Sec. 46-6. - Noise.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for any person to cause to be made any loud noise which is plainly audible from a distance of 100 feet.
(b)
The following acts when plainly audible from a distance of 100 feet are declared loud noises in violation of this section; but such enumeration shall not be deemed to be exhaustive:
(1)
The excessive sounding of any horn on any motor vehicle except as a warning signal.
(2)
Causing to be played, used or operated any radio, tape player, compact disc player, instrument, television, or other device for the producing or reproducing of sound between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. so as to disturb the residents of the area.

No person shall slow a heavy truck, medium truck, one ton light truck, or other truck over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating by using a "jake brake", which is an add-on engine brake for diesel engines, with a primary use on long downhill grades where the wheel brakes would otherwise have to be frequently pumped to keep the truck from gaining dangerous speed. Considering the size and topography of the city, the loud noise of jake brake use, wherein it opens the exhaust valve just as the air in the engine cylinder reaches maximum compression, with an almost instantaneous explosive release, said explosive noise outweighs any arguable benefit of such brake. The brakes shall be used instead. It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motor vehicle within the limits of the city without a proper muffler, in good working order and in constant operation, to prevent excessive or unusual noise. No person shall use a muffler cutout, bypass or similar device for noise making. This subsection shall not, however, apply to farm tractors.

(9)
Causing to be played, used, or operated in any vehicle, either stationary or mobile, any radio, tape player, compact disc player, instrument or other device for the producing of sound plainly audible from a distance of 100 feet or more so as to disturb the residents or any other affected persons in the area.
(c)

(2)
Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such purpose is manifested are:
a.
Such person is a known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller. For purposes of this section, a "known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller" is a person who has, within the knowledge of the arresting officer, been convicted of any violation involving any controlled substances as defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13, or such person has been convicted under substantially similar laws, or is a person who displays physical characteristics of drug intoxication or usage, such as "needle tracks", burned or callused thumb and index fingers, underweight, or nervous and excited behavior.

(4)
Any person who violates any provisions of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 46-13(e) below.
(b)
Juvenile curfew.
(1)
Purpose: The mayor and city council of Madison, Georgia have determined based on law enforcement reports that there has been an increase in juvenile violence and crime by persons under the age of 18 in Madison; that persons under the age of 18 are particularly susceptible, by their lack of maturity and experience, to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime; that criminal gang activity from the Athens area has infiltrated the Madison community; that there has been a significant increase in crimes such as substance abuse, entering autos, shootings, burglaries, damage to property, fighting, complaints of statutory rape, and other incidents indicating possible "gang" activity.
The City of Madison desires to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, seeks the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, strives for the protection of the general public, and implements this section for the reduction of the incidents of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances. O.C.G.A. § 15-11-2(11)(A)(v) states it is a violation when a juvenile "wanders or loiters about the streets of any city or in or about any highway or any public place between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 5:00 a.m."
The mayor and council recognize that in Mwangi v. State, 316 Ga. App. 52 (2012) the Court of Appeals held that: "Even when officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual, they may generally ask questions of that individual, ask to examine the individual's identification, and request consent to search, as long as police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required." However, the mayor and council also recognize that when an apparent juvenile declines to answer questions, provide identification or be searched, that law enforcement sometimes needs additional tools to be able to effectively police the community.
The council of Madison, Georgia has determined a curfew for those under the age of 18, many of whom are students, will be in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of Madison, and will promote the public good, safety and welfare. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm, and legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have demonstrated effectiveness in many cities. Law enforcement has reported upon the effectiveness of enforcing curfews in other communities such as Spalding County, Clayton County, Fayette County, Cherokee County, Chatham County, Murray County, Coffee County, Gwinnett County.
The mayor and council of Madison, Georgia has determined that a curfew ordinance will increase parental responsibility for minors within their control, decrease minor delinquency including criminal activity, and decrease truancy and tardiness of school age minors.
