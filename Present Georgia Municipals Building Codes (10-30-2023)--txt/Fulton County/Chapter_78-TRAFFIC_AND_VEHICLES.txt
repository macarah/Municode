ARTICLE IV. - TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM

Sec. 78-101. - Introduction.
Many local jurisdictions throughout the United States have been researching and developing measures to manage and control problems associated with traffic flow through their residential neighborhoods. The problems of excessive speeding, cut through traffic, and pedestrian safety are common to many of these jurisdiction.
The rapid rate of growth of the Metropolitan Atlanta Area Counties has resulted in a significant increase in the volume of traffic on area roadways. Motorists have sought alternative routes to avoid traffic congestion and length of delay experienced on these roadways. Some of these alternative routes are cut-thru routes through residential streets, which has resulted in a proliferation of traffic related problems in residential neighborhoods. Additionally, motorists tend to travel through residential areas, at speeds that greatly exceed the posted speed limit. Residents and neighborhood associations have voiced their concerns about these traffic problems. In light of this, the county board of commissioners has requested that the transportation division of the public works department develop a traffic calming program.
The mission of the traffic calming program is to improve and enhance the quality of life in residential neighborhoods, by reducing the negative impact of automobile traffic on neighborhood streets. The objective of the program is to develop and implement traffic calming initiatives which may provide corrective remedies to traffic problems associated with excessive speeding, cut-thru traffic, and vehicle and pedestrian safety. The transportation division will implement the program utilizing engineering, enforcement, education, and community participation. The traffic calming program although developed by the county, is meant to be a community driven program. The community will choose the type of traffic calming initiative that they deem suitable, based on the recommendations of county transportation division. The community may be required to pay for the cost of implementing, maintaining, and removing any device associated with the traffic calming initiatives. The funding mechanism will be determined by the board of commissioners. A complete description of various traffic calming devices, estimated costs, warrants and the county associated policies are included in this document.
(Ord. No. 98-1103, § 1.0, 9-2-98)
Sec. 78-102. - Definition.
Traffic calming devices are measures that are implemented to reduce the negative impact created by automobile usage of residential streets. They regulate the travel speeds of motorists, and allow the roadway to be shared safely by pedestrians and bicyclists. Traffic calming is often referred to as reverse traffic engineering because in traffic engineering, the approach is to increase the level of service of the roadway by adding capacity and reducing the lengths of delay time, whereas in traffic calming the general approach is to slow the traffic thereby increasing the lengths of delay time experience by motorists. These traffic calming measures include geometric changes to the existing roadway such as narrow lane widths, chokers, traffic circles, speed humps, and cul-de-sacs.
(Ord. No. 98-1103, § 1.2, 9-2-98)
Sec. 78-103. - Purpose.
The county traffic calming program establishes a policy guide for the county to consistently deal with traffic related matters, and promote safe and convenient travel in residential neighborhoods. The program outlines policies, processes and warrants for implementing traffic calming measures that may be used as possible remedies for traffic related problems in residential neighborhoods. Standardized designs for various devices are included as a part of this program, to ensure uniformity and safety. Variation from these standards may be approved by the county transportation administrator.
(Ord. No. 98-1103, § 1.3, 9-2-98)
Sec. 78-104. - Implementation.
Before any traffic calming measure can be implemented, a traffic study must be undertaken by the transportation division, who will analyze the data and make the appropriate recommendations. Staff of the transportation division are available to make presentations and discuss their findings and recommendations to neighborhood associations and community groups. The recommendations that are made are based on engineering and design standards publications such as the AASHTO Green Book, the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices), the TRB-Highway Capacity Manual, Fulton County Public Works Design Standards, and other design standards and regulations. Staff will use prudence and good judgement in their recommendations, so that the health, welfare and safety of the community are considered when recommending a traffic calming device. The following are some of the factors that will be consider for any traffic calming device to be implemented.
(1)
The county will only consider installation of traffic calming devices on streets classified as local, residential streets.
(2)
Traffic studies must confirm that a traffic related problem exist before the county will recommend a traffic calming device.
(3)
For speeding, the study must find that a speeding problem exist, based on the standard 85 th percentile speed of at least 11 MPH over the posted speed limit of the road.
(4)
For cut-thru traffic problems to be confirmed, the average daily traffic, peak hour volumes and directional turning movements will be compared to theoretical estimations as outlined in the most current (ITE) Institute of Transportation Trip Generation Guide.
(5)
For pedestrian and other safety related problems, confirmation will be made based on the accident data reports, inadequate roadway geometrics (such limited sight distance), school locations and other safety related parameters.
(6)
The county requires that there must be wide support from the community for implementing traffic calming measures in their neighborhood.
(7)
It is required that a formal petition be submitted to the county, showing that 75 percent of the property owners in the neighborhood and 90 percent of the property owners along the affected roadway affirm their support for installation of the traffic calming device. In certain circumstances, if number of residents supporting the petition is slightly less than that stated above, but a clear overwhelming majority support is shown for the initiative, the board of commissioners county may opt to waive these percentages.
(8)
The county transportation administrator may recommend the installation of traffic calming devices without the above percentages based on traffic safety.
(9)
The design of traffic calming devices must be safe and effective. The county requires that all traffic calming devices be designed as those outlined in this document (Appendix) [Not included in this Code]. Any variation from the standard designs must be approved by the transportation administrator, or his designee.
(10)
Once the traffic calming devices are installed, the county transportation division reserves the right to move, modify or remove the devices for operational or safety reasons at any time.
(11)
The neighborhood association may request to have any traffic calming device installed in their community removed. A formal petition will be required showing that 75 percent of the property owners in the neighborhood, and 90 percent of the property owners along the affected roadway affirm their support for removing these devices. Additionally, the neighborhood will be required to cover the cost associated with removing these devices.
(12)
The county may deny a request to remove a traffic calming device based on operational and safety reasons.
(Ord. No. 98-1103, § 2.0, 9-2-98)
Sec. 78-105. - Petition for installing traffic calming devices.
(a)
[Petition.] Where engineering studies indicate that installing traffic calming devices on county-maintained neighborhood roads would correct or improve a traffic situation, and their installation is favored by a majority of property owners in the area, a petition must be submitted to the transportation division of the county for review. All of the property owners in the subdivision should be contacted and given an opportunity to sign this petition, indicating their "yes" or "no" concerning the installation of the traffic calming device. Unless property is undergoing change of ownership, a spouse's signature will not be acceptable if he/she is not the legal owner. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures are required. A "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not is not acceptable. All owners must sign individually, including owners of undeveloped lots. Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal homeowner. The purpose of the homeowner's association officer attesting to the signatures is to verify the signatures of the property owners. The percentages will be calculated, based on individual lots where owners sign affirmatively, divided by the total number of lots in the plotted subdivision, units, or "defined service area." Each lot counts as only one lot regardless of owners signing. At least 75 percent of the homeowners in the neighborhood and 90 percent of the homeowners along the affected roadway must vote in favor of installing the traffic calming device, before the petition can be presented to the board of commissioners.
The completed petition must be signed, notarized and the returned to the transportation division, where it will be checked by tax records and land lot maps to insure that it meets all requirements. It will be returned to the sender if it does not meet the requirements. Petitions that do meet the requirements will be presented to the commissioners at their regular Wednesday meeting. A public hearing will be announced at that time for each petition. At the public hearing, the petition will be approved or disapproved by the board of commissioners.
(b)
Installation funded by the neighborhood. The installation of the traffic calming devices by a private contractor will not be considered final until personnel of the department of public works inspect them for compliance with design standards. Charges associated with the installation of these devices are handled by the homeowners association at the time of installation. All installation cost will be funded by the subdivision with the county acting in the role of project administrator. The county will assist the neighborhood in securing a private contract for the construction of speed humps. It is the responsibility of the neighborhood association or the contractor to file for a land disturbance permit with the county development services department. County personnel will inspect and approve the construction of said devices to insure that they meet the design criteria outlined in this document.
Annualized charges for the maintenance and repair of traffic calming devices are assessed to the neighborhood association through a private agreement with the county at the end of the year. It is the responsibility of the neighborhood association to assess fees to members as determined by the association. The neighborhood association may enter into a private agreement with county for the private maintenance of the traffic calming at such that a yearly maintenance fee will not be collected by the county but the association will be required to maintain these devices to county standards within a reasonable time period as determined by the county.
(c)
Installation funded by the county. The county will be responsible for all cost associated with the installation at traffic calming devices. Material and repair cost will also be assumed by the county.
(Ord. No. 98-1103, § 3.0, 9-2-98)
Sec. 78-106. - Types of traffic calming devices.
Various types of traffic calming devices/techniques are presented in this section. They are presented and categorized according to their suitability to correct problems associated with each type of neighborhood traffic problem. Some of these devices have been shown to be effective in solving one or more types of traffic-related problems. Results of studies released through the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) of technical papers, indicate that the following were quite effective in residential speed control.
