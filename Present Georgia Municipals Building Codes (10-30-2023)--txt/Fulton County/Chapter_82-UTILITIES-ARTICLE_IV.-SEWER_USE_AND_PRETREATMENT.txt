(b)
National categorical pretreatment standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated:
(1)
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2)
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3)
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4)
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
(c)
Pretreatment standards. The State of Georgia has not established separate pretreatment standards from the federal categorical standards but has established in-stream water quality standards which are to be used in calculating the local limits.
(d)
Local limits. Fulton County's local limits are tabulated in Appendix A1—A4 and are subject to changes or revisions as may be deemed necessary by the county. Therefore the county reserves the right to revise an IU's discharge permit, to restrict volume of discharge and mass of certain pollutant previously permitted and, if necessary revoke an IU's discharge permit if such discharge would result directly or indirectly in a violation of State or Federal standards at the POTW.
(e)
County's right of revision. The county reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
(f)
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-238. - Pretreatment of wastewater.

The user is not required to resample if the director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
(i)
Discharge of hazardous waste.
(1)
The discharge of any hazardous waste as defined under 40 CFR Part 261 is hereby prohibited without prior written authorization of the director. Discharge of certain hazardous materials may be allowed after submitting in writing to the director the following information: the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261; the EPA hazardous waste number; the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other); an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream to be discharged; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
(2)
Any user who receives written authorization from the director to commence the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the receiving POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director and hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 calendar days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 82-241(e) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 82-241(a), 82-241(c) and 82-241(d) of this article.
(3)
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(4)
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 calendar days of the effective date of such regulations.
(5)
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.
(6)
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued there under, or any applicable federal or law.
(j)
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
(k)
Sample collection.
(1)
Except as indicated in subsection (2), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(l)
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted when received on or before the required date. Submittals received by mail after this date, will be considered late even though postmarked on or before the required date.
(m)
Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the county, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director.
(n)
Operator and lab analyst certification.
(1)
Industrial pretreatment facility operators who are working at and who remain at an industrial wastewater treatment facility on July 1, 1991, will have until July 1, 1996 to obtain either a minimum class III wastewater treatment plant operator certificate or industrial wastewater operator certificate as issued by the Georgia Board of Examiners for Certification of Water and Wastewater Treatment and Operators and Laboratory Analysts. Any uncertified operator hired after July 1, 1991 will have 12 months from the start of employment to obtain certification.
(2)
Any industrial laboratory analyst who conducts certain tests, as defined by the board of examiners for certification of water and wastewater treatment and operators and laboratory analysts, in conjunction with the operation of an industrial pretreatment facility shall obtain a certificate from said board; provided, however, that an industrial wastewater pretreatment plant shall be required to have only one responsible analyst obtain such a certificate, and any other analyst in that facility shall be supervised by such person. Any new analyst in responsible charge who is hired after July 1, 1991 will have 12 months from the start of employment to obtain the needed certificate. Any person who has obtained or shall obtain a class I or class II certification by the board as a wastewater treatment plant operators shall not be required to obtain a laboratory analyst certificate from the board to provide services as a laboratory analyst.
(3)
This certification requirement only applies to industries with pretreatment permits. The county will determine which level of certification is needed on a case-by-case basis.

(2)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
(3)
Any other discharge violation that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
(4)
Any discharge of pollutants that have caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or have resulted in the director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(5)
Failure to meet, within 90 calendar days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(6)
Failure to provide within 30 calendar days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
(7)
Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(8)
Any other violation(s) which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-245. - Administrative enforcement remedies.
(a)
Notification of violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(b)
Consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 82-245(d) and 82-245(e) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(c)
Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(d)
Compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer and/or water service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(e)
Cease and desist orders. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1)
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2)
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(f)
Administrative fines.
(1)
When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user in an amount of at least $1,000.00 a day for each violation. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(2)
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 25 percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of two percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
(3)
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten calendar days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
(4)
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(g)
Emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(1)
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 82-245(g) of this article are initiated against the user.
(2)
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 82-245(c) or 82-245(h) of this article.
(h)
Termination of discharge. In addition to the provisions in section 82-240(f) of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1)
Violation of wastewater discharge permits conditions;
(2)
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
(3)
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4)
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5)
Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 82-237 of this article.
(i)
Notice of termination. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 82-245(3) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-246. - Judicial enforcement remedies.
(a)
Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the court or court of like jurisdiction through the county's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(b)
Civil penalties.
(1)
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the county for at least $1,000.00 a day for each violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(2)
The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the county.
(3)
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(4)
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
(c)
Criminal prosecution.
(1)
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of at least $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 12 months, or both.
(2)
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 a day per violation or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 12 months, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under law.
(3)
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 12 months, or both.
(4)
In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 12 months, or both.
(d)
Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the county's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-247. - Supplemental enforcement action.
(a)
Performance bonds. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the county, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(b)
Liability insurance. The director may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
(c)
Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(d)
Public nuisance. A violation of any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Code of Law of Fulton County governing such nuisances, and may be required to reimburse the county for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-248. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(a)
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 82-237(a)(1) of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 82-237(a)(2)c. through 82-237(a)(2)g. and 82-237(a)(2)i. through 82-237(a)(2)q. of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(b)
Bypass.
(1)
For the purposes of this section:
a.
"Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
b.
"Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2)
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section.
(3)
a.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten calendar days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
b.
A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five calendar days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4)
a.
Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
1.
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
2.
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
3.
The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
b.
The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4)a. of this section.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-249. - Wastewater treatment rates.
The county shall operate and maintain the POTW in accordance with and federal regulations and from time to time as deemed necessary shall expand, upgrade or otherwise improve the POTW. The costs of operation, maintenance and improvements shall be born by the county, except where and/or federal funding may be available to support certain improvements. The funding for operations, maintenance, upgrades, expansions and improvements shall be collected through user fees, surcharges, connection fees and other water/sewer related charges. A fee schedule has been established by the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and is evaluated and revised from time to time to reflect actual cost of operating, maintaining and improving the POTW. A current fee schedule has been published and made available in the Fulton County Public Works Department.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-250. - Miscellaneous provisions.
(a)
Pretreatment charges and fees. The county may adopt from time to time reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the county's pretreatment program which may include:
(1)
Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications;
(2)
Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
(3)
Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction;
(4)
Fees for filing appeals;
(5)
Surcharge fees for higher strength wastewater for compatible pollutants;
(6)
Charges for costs incurred by the county due to an industry's noncompliance which results in damages, obstructions, or any other impairment to the POTW or environment, or any expense of whatever character or nature to the county.
(7)
Other fees as the county may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the county.
(b)
Industrial waste surcharge for compatible pollutants.
(1)
The county, at its discretion, shall charge and assess all IU's discharging industrial strength wastewater into the county sewerage system. The surcharge shall be in addition to any sewer service charges, for those wastes containing pollutant concentrations consistently greater than any of the following:
DOMESTIC WASTEWATER CONCENTRATIONS:
a.
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) 350 mg/L
b.
Total suspended solids (TSS) 200 mg/L
c.
Phosphorous (P) 5.0 mg/L
d.
Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) 25.0 mg/L
(2)
IU's subject to surcharge fees may still be required to pretreat their discharge if their discharge exceeds any of the limitations shown in appendix A1 for other regulated pollutants or if there is insufficient capacity at the receiving POTW.
(3)
The mass limits in Appendix A1 define the total mass load allocated to industry for compatible pollutants at each POTW and is based on each facility's overall design criteria minus the current and planned future domestic loading. An appropriate safety factor is already built into these figures. The difference between the total figure and the existing permitted industrial load shall be used to calculate the remaining capacity available for new industries or expansion of existing industries.
(4)
Allocation of the mass based discharge parameters shall be on a first come, first serve basis and each IU shall be issued a permit allowing a monthly average and daily maximum mass discharge for each pollutant permitted. Once permitted, the mass allowed in the discharge permit is added to the total industrial inventory for the appropriate POTW, thereby reducing the remaining available capacity allowed for future industrial use. However an industry which fails to utilize a significant portion of its permitted discharge may be subject to a reduction so as not to tie up capacity that might otherwise be available to new or expanding IUs.
(5)
The county shall have the right to reduce an IU's discharge permit for any parameter, for reasons including but not limited to the following:
a.
Operational problems or emergency at the POTW;
b.
Reduction in capacity at the POTW,
c.
Order of or federal regulatory agency;
d.
Failure of the industry to comply with its discharge permit;
e.
Failure of the IU to control surges or slug loadings;
f.
Failure of the industry's discharge to realize a significant portion of the mass load allocated to it.
(6)
Where TKN test results are not available or feasible, the TKN shall be calculated based on the ammonia-nitrogen test (NH 3 ) which shall be taken as 60 percent of the TKN, unless the value of the organic nitrogen component can be shown.
(7)
At the county's discretion, IU's subject to surcharge may be issued discharge permits with specific limitations for flow and concentration in addition to mass of pollutants in the discharge. Application for any increase in discharge limits shall be made in writing to the county. Unauthorized increases in discharge shall be subject to enforcement actions, as outlined in section 82-245 of this document.
(8)
Surcharge fees for the compatible pollutants and other fees such as may be reasonable and appropriate shall be established and revised from time to time in the Fulton County fee schedule.
(9)
Industrial surcharges shall be billed separately from other sewer service charges. Invoices will be sent either monthly or bi-monthly and payment shall be received within 30 days. Payments not received within 30 days will be assessed interest at 1.5 percent per month. Failure to pay surcharges may result in enforcement actions as outlined in section 82-245.
(10)
The amount of the surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all IUs discharging industrial wastewater into the county sewerage system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the county in handling excess COD, TSS, P, and TKN. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the water pollution control facilities including depreciation, solids handling, disposal and other incidental expenses. IU's shall also be responsible as provided in subsection 82-250(b)(8), or the cost of sampling and analysis required to determine the concentration, C, used in calculating the surcharge fees.
(11)
The surcharge amount will be based on the number of pounds (lbs.) of pollutant discharged over and above domestic strength wastewater for the four compatible pollutants and shall be calculated using the following formula:
S = U * (C - L) * F * 8.34
Where:
S
= the surcharge amount in dollars.
U
= the unit charge (cost/lb) established in the Fulton County fee schedule for a particular pollutant (COD, TSS, P, & TKN above).
C
= the concentration in milligrams per liter of the permitted pollutant, as either measured or estimated by methods approved by the county and the IU.
L
= the domestic wastewater concentration limit for the surcharge pollutant (COD, TSS, P, and TKN given above).
F
= the volume of flow (expressed in millions of gallons) discharged during the billing period from the IU as either measured or estimated by methods approved by the county and the IU. 8.34 = the "density" of water (lbs. per gallon).
(12)
The unit cost for each pollutant shall be determined annually by the director in order that the above factors may correctly represent current treatment and handling costs.
(13)
IU's may choose to pre-treat their discharge to the domestic strength concentrations indicated above in lieu of paying surcharge fees. In such cases, design and construction of pretreatment facilities shall be reviewed, and permitted by the county and shall be subject to all other provisions of these regulations as appropriate. IU's which provide pretreatment to avoid paying surcharge fees may still be subject to surcharge fees where the pretreatment facility fails to lower pollutant levels to domestic concentrations.
(14)
Industries which discharge only wastewater generated from restrooms and do not discharge process wastewater shall be exempt from the surcharge requirements (even though their wastewater may exhibit higher than domestic concentrations for some compatible pollutants) provided they have met the following criteria:
a.
A request is made in writing to the director to be exempt from surcharge fees on this basis.
b.
They provide the county with adequate documentation showing that their discharge is only connected to restroom plumbing and there is no process water in use.
(Res. No. 06-1167, 11-15-06)
Sec. 82-251. - Commercial wastewater pretreatment.
(a)
General provisions; non applicability to residential users.
(1)
This section pertains to fat, oil and grease (FOG), grit, and any other wastes of commercial origin which may be discharged to the POTW and sanitary sewer. This section of the article shall regulate commercial waste generators only and not residential users.
(2)
For the purposes of this section, wastes of commercial origin are those generated by restaurants, institution kitchens, and other food service establishments, as well as car maintenance, automobile dealerships and car/truck wash facilities. All commercial waste generators involved in the preparation of food for commercial purposes shall provide an approved fat, oil, grease (FOG) pretreatment system such as a grease trap, provided that the excess FOG is floatable and can be effectively removed. All commercial facilities with vehicle servicing or car washing will be required to provide a pretreatment system such as an oil separator and/or sand trap to remove oil waste prior to discharging to the sanitary sewer.
(b)
Pretreatment equipment installation, maintenance, and grease disposal requirements.
(1)
All users involved in the preparation of food for commercial purposes shall provide approved fat, oil, grease (FOG) removal equipment such as separators or traps, if:
a.
The user generates a wastewater which contains greater than the quantity of FOG permitted in these regulations, and/or,
b.
The excess FOG is floatable and can be effectively removed in an oil/grease separator or trap, then said user shall be required to install an oil/grease separator.
(2)
Oil/grease traps shall be required for commercial and industrial establishments where it has been determined by the director that they are necessary to prevent discharge to the sewer system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the system.
(3)
Alternative pretreatment systems include automatic waste removal equipment and shall be used only after evaluation and authorization by the director.
(4)
Commercial car and truck washing facilities which discharge to the county sewer shall provide grit and oil removal as d elsewhere in these regulations.
(5)
All oil/grease separators shall be designed and installed in accordance with county standards. The user shall submit plans to the county for review and comment. The installation shall be subject to the county's inspection prior to placing in service.
(6)
Grit and oil/grease separators shall be installed in accordance to the current official plumbing code used by the county.
(7)
When required by the county, the user shall install a suitable manhole on the discharge to the sewer to allow for observation, sampling and measurement of wastewaters. This manhole shall be installed at the user's expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible to the county at all times.
(8)
It shall be a violation of these regulations when a person:
a.
Allows commercial waste that emits noxious or offensive odors or is unsanitary or injurious to public health or property to spill, overflow or be discharged onto public or private property.
b.
Allows commercial waste to be removed from a facility under his/her control except by a transporter holding a valid and current license/permit for pumping in the State of Georgia.
c.
Allows commercial waste generated at a facility under his/her control to be disposed of at a site not permitted by a LGA or the division.
d.
Allows commercial waste generated at a facility under his/her control to enter the county sewerage system which exceeds the limitations set forth in section 82-237(a)(1).
(c)
Operation and maintenance of pretreatment system.
(1)
All oil/grease, and grit separators shall be maintained by the user, at the user's expense, in continually efficient operation at all times. The user shall service each separator frequently and repair as necessary, to ensure that the effluent discharge does not exceed the limits set forth in section 82-237(a)(2) of this article. The user shall maintain records of said service and make available to the director upon request.
(2)
It shall constitute a violation of this article to introduce chemicals, acidic or caustic substances which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils and grease to the extent that it later solidifies in the county sewer line, pump station or treatment plant. Use of any other substances, including enzymes and special bacteria is solely at the discretion of the user. Prior to the use of any biological products, the user shall inform the county in writing their intent to add such products to their pretreatment system.
(3)
The county shall have the authority to prohibit the addition of any substance, including enzymes and bacteria used for maintenance of a grease trap if it is discovered that said substance causes damage to or interferes with the operation or maintenance of the POTW, creates a public nuisance or odor, or presents a potential hazard to personnel.
(4)
If upon inspection, it is determined that a grease trap is in need of cleaning, the only acceptable means shall be to pump out the grease for disposal as provided elsewhere in this document. Applying heavy doses of chemicals, enzymes or bacteria to the grease trap will not be allowed as a substitute for pumping and removing the material from the trap.
(5)
Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions of enzymes, special bacteria or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable grease trap.
(d)
Permits.
(1)
Construction permit. No portion of a pretreatment system shall be installed, repaired, altered, modified or replaced until a pretreatment construction permit has been issued by the county. A fee will be required for review of plans. Permits issued for new construction shall become void 18 months after the date of issuance if the system has not been installed. However, if building construction has commenced, the system construction permit shall be valid for an additional 90 calendar days beyond the 18-month expiration date. Permits for system repairs shall become void after 90 calendar days from the date of issuance. A construction or repair permit for a pretreatment system shall be transferred to another person if the transferee files an amended application providing all corrected information and proof of ownership of the property or tenant occupancy within 60 calendar days after the transfer of ownership, and all information pertaining to the sitting, location, and installation conditions or repair of a pretreatment system remains the same. There is no fee associated with the processing to the transfer. The date of the construction or repair permit shall not be amended, but shall run from the date of original issuance prior to the transfer.
(2)
Construction revision permit. The applicant shall be the permit holder and shall be held responsible for all information supplied to the county. The signed application, site evaluation, and system design plans when required, serve as the basis by which the county determines the issuance of a construction permit. In the event of a change in any information given in the application which served as basis for issuing a construction permit, the permit holder will immediately file an amended application detailing such changed conditions. If the new conditions are determined to be in compliance with county engineering standards, the construction permit shall be amended. If the new conditions are determined to be in non-compliance with the county engineering standards, the permit shall no longer be valid.
(3)
Commercial waste permit. A commercial waste permit shall be required by any commercial waste generator discharging to the county sanitary sewer and POTW. The permit will be valid for one year from the date of issuance and is not transferable. The permit must be placed in a location visible to inspections. If the owner of a pretreatment system remains the same but the ownership of the building changes, a site tenant is still operating within the permit guidelines. No new building tenant shall open for business until the county has approved the change of tenancy, and inspected the pretreatment system to see if it is still within the guidelines of the original operating permit (see section "commercial waste permits issuance").
(4)
Voiding a permit. If the system is improperly modified or damaged, the county shall undertake administrative action to revoke the permit. The county shall prohibit the further or continued use of a system when the permit has become void. The contractor, engineer or licensed plumber will be responsible to do a permit revision and present corrected plans for review. If a larger system is required based on project modifications another final inspection will be required once the system installation has been completed.
(e)
Pretreatment inspections.
(1)
New construction. Before covering with earth and before placing a pretreatment system into service, a person/company installing or constructing any portion of a pretreatment system shall notify the county prior to completion of the construction activities and shall have the system inspected by the county for compliance with the requirements of this article. A final inspection fee will be required. The county shall make every reasonable effort to make a complete inspection of system construction, modification, replacement or alteration within two (2) working days after notification to the county that the system is ready for inspection. A repair shall be inspected by the county to determine compliance with construction permit standards prior to final covering of the system. If the system constructed is approved by the county, an "inspection approval" notice will be given to the installer. If the system installation does not pas the construction inspection, then the installer shall make all required corrections and notify the county within seven (7) calendar days for a re-inspection of the system. A re-inspection fee shall be charged to the installer for additional inspection(s) if the contractor has failed to correct the items an inspector has required at the preliminary inspection. Final installation approval shall not be granted until the county has confirmed that the installation is in compliance with plans and specifications submitted with the permit application. If no final construction inspection can be documented of the commercial waste generators pretreatment system, then the certificate of occupancy on the project will not be released.

Existing pretreatment systems. The county will perform an annual inspection of all pretreatment systems permitted to operate in the county. The inspections will be conducted to make sure the commercial waste generator is following the maintenance criteria set forth in this article and the waste generator is operating under the conditions of the permit. Those facilities found in non-compliance will be required to correct all violations within seven calendar days of notification. However, if the violation requires a repair, replacement or installation of a pretreatment system, then the commercial waste generator will have 45 calendar days to comply. All repairs, replacement and installations will require approval by the county.
(f)
Location and installation.
(1)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed closest to the discharge source of the commercial waste. A subsurface pretreatment system must be located or installed no more than 50 feet from the discharge source. A subsurface pretreatment system installed beyond 50 feet must have approval by the county.
(2)
Pretreatment systems will be located and installed so that proper maintenance of the system does not create sanitary nuisances or health hazards and does not impact the environment.
(3)
Pretreatment systems must be located and installed so that they are accessible for maintenance. No heavy kitchen equipment, canisters, dumpster or trash compactor can block access to the pretreatment system.
(4)
Interior grease traps will be installed at the point source such as a three- to four-compartment sink, dishwasher, or any kitchen equipment where grease must be collected prior to discharge to building waste line. Interior grease traps will be located above the floor. Recessed grease traps must have prior approval for installation. All interior grease traps must have a flow control valve and a vent. The flow control valve shall be placed on the inlet side of the grease trap. The vent line will take all odors out of the building.
(5)
Pretreatment systems installed and located that experience a rusting of parts (e.g. pretreatment system located under a kitchen sink) which may impair the opening of the system for inspection, will require the commercial waste generator to provide access to the system. If the commercial waste generator cannot provide access, then they will be in violation. Inspector can require the unit replaced if it has deteriorated from corrosion.
(6)
Pretreatment systems installed and located to the outside of a building will discharge to the sanitary sewer line. The test manhole is the last discharge point of the pretreatment system before the sanitary sewer. The sanitary sewer connection from the pretreatment system will not be allowed to connect to the site sanitary sewer line by going under or through the building. The connection to the sanitary sewer line must be kept to the exterior of the building structure. The connection from the building to the pretreatment system will be a direct straight line. One 90- or 45-degree angle will be allowed with a clean out if a straight line is not obtainable. The test manhole will be located a maximum of four feet from the last tank in the pretreatment system and must have an invert in the test manhole. Prefab concrete or brick construction is allowed.
(7)
All pretreatment systems installed subsurface in multi-level parking decks must be located on the ground level of the structure and must be located so they are accessible for maintenance and inspection.
(8)
Installation of alternative interior pretreatment system will be allowed for commercial waste generators where an upgrade, repair, or installation of a pretreatment system is required and a subsurface system is not possible. However, the commercial waste generator must meet the following criteria for an alternative pretreatment system to be installed:
a.
The facility must be located in an existing building structure 15 years or older, where written documentation is submitted by a licensed engineer, contractor or master plumber to verify a subsurface pretreatment system is impossible to install due to existing under ground utilities,
b.
The facility is not located in new commercial development,
c.
The facility provides written documentation by a licensed engineer, contractor or master plumber that the sanitary sewer tie in of a subsurface pretreatment cannot be reached by the installer,
d.
The facility's pretreatment system is found to be inadequate and an alternative system will upgrade the current pretreatment system to bring the facility into compliance.
(9)
Any subsurface pretreatment system requiring installation of more than one single tank will lace the tanks in tandem; one single line. The multiple tanks must be installed so the commercial waste from the building will flow from tank to tank. The distance from tank to tank will not be greater than 12 inches (refer to Fulton County standard detail 671).
(g)
Design of pretreatment system. Oil water separators grease traps, and sand traps will be required for commercial and industrial establishments as a pretreatment system where it is determined by the county that they are necessary to prevent oil and grease waste discharge to the sanitary sewer system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the sewer system and the county POTW. The user shall submit plans to the county for review and comment. The installation shall be subject to the county's inspection prior to placing in service.
(1)
Subsurface pretreatment systems shall comply with the structural requirements as indicated on the Fulton County standard 671 or 671A and this article. All subsurface pretreatment systems must comply with the engineering standards indicated on the standard detail, as well the current plumbing code used by the county.
(2)
For the sizing of pretreatment systems by specific generators source, refer to generator source charts, tables I and II. Systems currently installed will not change unless the pretreatment system is found to be:
a.
Inadequate for the facility's current operation.
b.
In violation due to a commercial waste generator failing to provide documentation for maintenance of the current system and an inspection reveals an upgrade or repair is required.
c.
Located in a spill area and the commercial waste generator has failed to maintain the pretreatment system, which results in a fine from the county or clean up is required and an inspection reveals the current system is inadequate or in need of repair.
d.
Installed incorrectly and not per plumbing code used by the county or engineering standards. The existing system shall be corrected where possible. If unable to correct, then the system must be replaced.
(3)
Subsurface pretreatment systems will have manhole covers over the inlet and outlet of the system (refer to standard detail 671). The concrete lid of tank will have circular openings for the placement of manhole covers. The manhole covers must be at least two feet in diameter. All openings on the pretreatment system will be core drilled.
(4)
Any 3,000-gallon pretreatment system can be installed in two sections provided the center section has been sealed properly where no leakage can occur. The maximum size for any single tank installation will be 3,000 gallons on commercial sites where a greater system is not required for spill containment. All 3,000-gallon tanks shall have a minimum of two manhole openings for access to the tanks for cleaning and inspection. The subsurface pretreatment system will be made of prefab concrete tanks or its equivalent and will be a solid continuous structure where no sealing or binding of the middle section of the tank is allowed. The tank cannot be fabricated in two sections on tanks less than 1,500 gallons. A baffle wall is required in the tanks and the baffle wall must be fabricated as a permanent fixture. A slide structure will not be allowed as a baffle wall. A three- to five-inch diameter hole in the baffle wall must have a PVC elbow pipe turned down a maximum two feet from the bottom of the tank (refer to standard detail 671).
(5)
A subsurface pretreatment system will have a standard manhole suitable for observation, sampling, and measurement of wastewater. This manhole shall be installed at the user's expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible to the county at all times. This manhole is called the test manhole and is considered part of the overall pretreatment system (see Fulton County standard 650).
(6)
Subsurface pretreatment systems installed must be certified as a grease trap or an oil water separator. A septic system will not be allowed in lieu of the required pretreatment system. Interior pretreatment systems must have PDI certification and the gallon (GPM) capacity must be labeled on the unit. To verify type and size of tank purchased, an inspector can request a copy of the invoice for the pretreatment system installed.
(7)
All pretreatment systems that are subsurface will be brought to finished grade using pre-cast concrete cones. Brick work will also be allowed if the depth is no more than four feet to reach grade. The depth of the pretreatment system will determine how the brick work should be built. The standard core hole in the top of a pre-cast pretreatment system lid is two feet. The brick work will be three feet in diameter around the core opening. The three-foot base will allow entry to the pretreatment system for maintenance. When using bricks, once 80 percent of the height has been achieved to the two-foot manhole opening, you must corbel in the brickwork in small increments (see Fulton County standard 650).
(8)
An alternative interior pretreatment system shall be used only after evaluation and authorization by the county. Any alternative pretreatment system unit authorized by the county for use must have product support for maintenance and operation of the system. The equipment must be available for sale and the supply must be readily available for installation. The use of an alternative system will require established procedures for routine maintenance, operational surveillance, and environmental monitoring to assure the system continues to function properly. Any fees incurred for quality assurance of this unit will be the total responsibility of the commercial, waste generator. The sizing of the grease trap will be based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but it must be equivalent to a subsurface pretreatment system gallon capacity where required.
(9)
A grease trap is used for the collection of kitchen waste discharge only. No can wash areas, no dumpster, no mop sinks, no food grinders and no floor drains in mechanical rooms, bathrooms, or discharge from food coolers. Commercial waste generators that have micro-brewery facilities may be subject to additional discharge requirements (see appendix B3, food service piping layout).
(10)
Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions of enzymes, special bacteria or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable pretreatment system.
(11)
It shall constitute a violation of this article to introduce chemicals, acidic or caustic substances which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils and grease to the extent that it later solidifies in the county sewer lines, pump stations, or POTW. If a commercial waste generator uses enzymes and bacteria for pretreatment maintenance and it is discovered that said substance causes damage to or interferes with the operation or maintenance of POTW, creates a public nuisance or odor, or presents a potential health hazard, then these additives will be prohibited. Use of any other substances, including special enzymes and bacteria is solely at the discretion of the commercial waste generator.
(12)
Grit, sand traps and oil water separators shall be installed in accordance to the current official plumbing code used by the county engineering standards (refer to the commercial waste generator source Table II in this article),
(13)
Any strip retail shopping center or office building showing subsurface pretreatment systems at designated buildings or structures will only be allowed discharge by a single tenant or food service to that system. No multiple users will be allowed. The only exception to this condition is a shopping mall with a food court where pretreatment systems are installed and maintained by the mail corporation or management leasing.
(h)
Maintenance of pretreatment systems.
(1)
Pretreatment systems shall be maintained by the commercial waste generator at their expense, to assure continually efficient operation at all times. The commercial waste generator shall. maintain records of said service and make available all records to the county upon request (refer to the manifest section of this article). The commercial waste generator must service their pretreatment system frequently or repair their system to maintain the following:
a.
A 25 percent tank retention capacity rule (see explanation below).*
b.
A top sludge cap less than two inches in tank.
c.
A suspended solids content of less than two inches on the bottom of tank.
d.
A pretreatment system able to maintain a daily discharge limit of 250 mg/l to sanitary sewer.
e.
A pretreatment system where no sludge deposits of grease or oil waste accumulate in a test manhole or create a grease/oil waste stream to the sanitary sewer.
f.
A pretreatment system that does not create any obnoxious odors and poses no threat to public health and welfare.
g.
A pretreatment system that does not cause back-ups to kitchen sinks or any interior kitchen or building plumbing.
h.
A pretreatment system that causes no manhole overflows no accumulation of oil/grease in the county sanitary sewer system, or affects the water quality of the county's POTW facilities.
* The 25 percent rule requires that the depth of oil and grease (floating and settled) in a trap shall not be equal to or greater than 25 percent of the total operating depth of the trap. The operating depth of the trap is determined by measuring the internal depth of the tank. If the tank is measured with more than two feet of floating top solids or more than two feet of settled solids, the tank is in violation.
Commercial pretreatment inspectors shall have the authority to adjust any facility's maintenance schedule if upon inspection it is determined the maintenance schedule of the pretreatment system is not controlling the discharge of grease/oil waste to the sanitary sewer.
(2)
The following maintenance schedule shall be required for pretreatment systems operating in the county:

(4)
Commercial waste generators located in an area that have experienced a spill where a county sanitary sewer system has been impacted or a manhole has overflowed due to grease/oil accumulation must provide the county with a maintenance schedule to prevent this from occurring again. If the maintenance schedule is found to be inadequate or does not adhere to the maintenance schedule required by the county for that specific pretreatment system, the county shall have the right to amend that commercial waste generators' maintenance schedule to control any further commercial waste discharge that could impact the sanitary sewer system, manhole or pretreatment system.
(5)
Any commercial waste generator(s) found to be in violation for failure to maintain their pretreatment system in a spill area shall be assessed one-half the cost for clean up and/or fined by the county due to commercial waste impacting the environment or sanitary sewer system. Additional fines may be imposed by the state.
(6)
Any commercial waste generator found not adhering to any maintenance standards as established by this article will be in violation.
(7)
Any commercial waste generator requesting a deviation from a pretreatment system maintenance schedule as stated in this article shall submit their request in writing. The written request must include documentation that verifies that the pretreatment system has been operating within the guidelines for a year as stated in section 82-251(h)(1) and the modification of the maintenance schedule will not change the compliance status of the pretreatment system.
(8)
A commercial waste generator who operates a food service in their establishment, but the food service is not considered their main business income will be required to cease their food operation if they violate any parts of this article. Once the generator has come into compliance the food service operation can resume.
(i)

Any violations do not negate their existence. The county shall have the right to use other laws that may be applicable when determining violations.
(p)
Citations and administrative appeal.
(1)
Citations.
a.
Citations shall be issued when the commercial waste generator fails to correct the same violation after a notice of violation has been issued and the commercial waste generator demonstrates willful neglect or non-compliance with this article. Any citations issued will be required to be paid in 30 calendar days from the day of issuance. A citation must be in writing and must describe the particular nature of the violation, including specific references to the provisions of this article violated and the time frame for correction. Refusal of the citation will not negate its issuance.
(2)
Administrative appeal.
a.
Generators desiring to dispute citations must file a written request for the director to reconsider the citation along with full payment of the citation amount within 15 calendar days of citation issuance. Where a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter. If the citation has been paid and the director rules in favor of the generator, all money shall be returned to the generator. If the recipient fails to execute their right to contest the citation, the county will conclude the recipient has waived their right and they must pay the initial citation fine and/or the maximum fine.
b.
The county may reduce or waive the fine imposed by the citation after consideration of the gravity of the violation, the person's attempts at correcting the violation and the commercial waste generator's history of previous violations. However, violations that occur due to a spill or illegally discharging to the county sanitary sewer system will not be waived or reduced.
