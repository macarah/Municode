Sec. 2-66. - Declaration of policy.
It is essential to the proper government and administration of Fulton County that members of the board of commissioners, as well as all other officers and employees of the county, are in fact and in appearance, independent and impartial in the performance of their official duties; that public service not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the county. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of county officers and employees, the public interest requires that the county protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards of conduct. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the county that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards hereinafter set forth must be so interpreted and understood as not to unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination to seek and serve in public office by those persons best qualified to serve. To that end, no officer or employee of the county, except as otherwise provided by law, should be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest situation would necessarily result. The policy and purpose of this code of ethics, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the persons hereinabove named in the discharge of their official duties; to implement the objective of protecting the integrity of the county's government; and to prescribe only such essential restrictions against conflicts of interest as will not impose unnecessary barriers against public service.
