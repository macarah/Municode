ARTICLE XI. - MASSAGE THERAPY[9]

Footnotes:
--- (9) ---
State Law reference— Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act, O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-1 et seq.; municipal ordinances in effect before July 1, 2005, relating to the practice of massage therapy or requiring licensure of a massage therapist are preempted from enforcement against persons issued a license under Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act, O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22.

Sec. 8-406. - Statement of purpose.
(a)
The purpose of this article is to ensure the public health, welfare and freedom from the use of ostensibly legitimate businesses to further criminal activities such as pandering and prostitution and also to protect minors from involvement with such business practices.
(b)
In enacting this article with regards to licensing, the Mayor and Council recognize that an individual's past actions are very often the best indicators of that person's future actions.
