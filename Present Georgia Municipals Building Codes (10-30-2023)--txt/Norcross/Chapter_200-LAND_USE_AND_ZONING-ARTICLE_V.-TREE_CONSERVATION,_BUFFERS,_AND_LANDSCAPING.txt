(h)
Maintenance of buffers.
(1)
Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a structure, the developer or record title holder shall guarantee to the city to replace any required landscaping materials which die within one year after approval or acceptance thereof by the city, and shall warrant all work in the buffer area for a period of one year after approval or acceptance thereof by the city, whichever is later. The Community Development Director or their designee may at his/her option require that a bond or other suitable security be posted to ensure compliance with this provision.
(2)
The required buffer shall be maintained by the record title holder at the time of development, for so long as he holds title, and thereafter by any subsequent record title holders, so as to provide an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis.
(3)
In the event a screen, wall, fence, planted dividing strip or any other type of buffer that is required by the UDO will be subjected to periodic inspections by the Community Development Department to determine that such required walls, fences, etc., are being properly maintained. After a lot is rezoned and a buffer is required, the lot shall not be used unless and until the required buffer is in place and is the required height and width. Failure to maintain such required walls, fences, etc., to an acceptable standard may be deemed a violation of this UDO.

Sec. 205-5. - Tree conservation.
(a)
Tree density requirements.
(1)
Use of tree units. The landscaping requirements of this article regarding the preservation or planting of trees is expressed in terms of "tree units" rather than the number of trees or tree canopy. This approach provides the applicant with wide latitude of choice as to the number and sizes of trees to be planted, and their distribution following aesthetic landscaping practices, while achieving a common standard on all properties.
(2)
Establishment of tree unit values. The diameter of a tree's trunk establishes the "tree unit" value of an existing tree, as shown on table 205-5(1), or for a newly planted tree as shown on table 205-5(2).
a.
The values assigned to trees of the same size are different for existing and new trees, as indicated in the table. One "unit" is not the same as one "tree."
b.
Actual tree diameters or calipers are to be rounded to the nearest whole number for the calculation of tree unit values (e.g., four and one half inches in diameter = five inches).

Tree unit values for specimen trees or tree stands.
a.
Specimen trees and specimen tree stands; defined.
1.
Specimen tree: any tree which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to size, type and condition, as follows.
a)
Any tree in fair or better condition which equals or exceeds the following diameter breast height (dbh) sizes:
1)
28-inch dbh—overstory hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweetgums, etc.
2)
12-inch dbh—understory small trees such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.
3)
30-inch dbh—pine trees (all species).
b)
A tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum standards:
1)
A life expectancy of greater than 15 years.
2)
A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay, and less than 20 percent radial trunk dieback.
3)
No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
4)
No major insect or pathological problem.
c)
A lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance, subject to approval of the Community Development Director or their designee.
d)
A lesser size tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project, subject to approval of the Community Development Director or their designee.
2.
Specimen tree stand: A contiguous grouping of trees which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the Community Development Director or their designee. Determination is based upon the following criteria:
a)
A relatively mature, even-aged stand.
b)
A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.
c)
A stand of historical significance.
d)
A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality.
b.
The tree unit values shown in table 205-5(1) may be increased by 100 percent for an existing tree that meets the definition of a "specimen tree" or for a "specimen tree stand" as defined herein, provided that extraordinary measures as needed are taken to protect the tree and assure its survival. Such measures may include but are not limited to the provision of tree wells, retaining walls, aeration, or supplementary irrigation, as applicable to the site of the tree and as approved by the Director. Any specimen tree determined to be part of a tree save plan for any development which is damaged or ultimately needs to be removed due to the development process will result in a penalty assessed at $1,000.00 per tree density unit of specimen(s) removed. Said funds from this section to be deposited to the city's tree bank.
c.
Specimen tree removal specifications. A specimen tree is any tree, in fair or better condition, which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to size, species, or condition, and which meets the DBH specifications outlined above. Calculate the specimen tree removal fee at $500.00 for each tree density unit of the specimen tree(s) removed. For example, one 28-inch DBH Oak = 6.2 units x $500.00/unit = a fee of $3,100.00. The tree removal permit shall not be issued, nor shall the specimen(s) be removed, until funds are received by the city. Tree removal without or prior to a lawfully issued tree removal permit will result in a penalty assessed at $1,000.00 per tree density unit of specimen(s) removed. Said funds from this section to be deposited to the city's tree bank.
(b)
Tree density standards.
(1)
Tree retention. On each property for which a tree preservation and/or replacement plan is required, existing trees shall be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed a tree density standard as follows:
a.
Residential—16 tree density units per acre for developments in the preliminary, final or exemption plat process. For residential lots with established homes, see table below.

(4)
Easement exclusion. Properties possessing natural gas, petroleum or electric power transmission easements, or major sanitary sewer main (greater than eight inches in diameter) or water main (greater than 16 inches in diameter) distribution easements, may exclude the land area contained in the easement from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the tree density standard provided that no improvements (e.g. parking lots, tennis courts, driveways, greenways, storm water detention facilities, etc.) are proposed within the easement. If any improvements are proposed within the easement, then the land area so used within the easement for the improvements, plus an additional ten feet of land area surrounding the improvements, shall be included in the total acreage of the property to fulfill the tree density standard.
(5)
Lake and pond exclusion. Properties with a lake or pond may exclude the land area contained in the lake or pond from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the tree density standard.
(6)
Invasive and nuisance species exclusion. Invasive species and nuisance species are exempt from the tree removal permit fee but are subject to a $25 assessment fee by the community development designee. Invasive and nuisance species include Tree-of-Heaven, Mimosa, Chinaberry, Princesstree, Chinese Tallow Tree, Bradford Pear, and Leyland Cypress.
(c)
Tree density standard calculation. The tree density standard shall be calculated by summing the credits and dividing the sum by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application.

Prohibited activities. Within the tree protection areas, without proper authorization or permit the following activities shall be prohibited:
a.
Vehicle traffic or parking;
b.
Materials or equipment storage;
c.
Soil disturbance;
d.
Soil excavation;
e.
Removal of topsoil;
f.
Trenching;
g.
Soil fill;
h.
Change in soil pH;
i.
Change in soil drainage;
j.

(4)
Planted trees. All planted trees shall be actively protected during the development process and passively protected throughout the life of the development. The entire tree, including the crown, trunk, and roots, and the critical root zone, shall be protected.
(5)
Existing trees in construction zones. All trees that are outside the formal tree protection zone(s) as outlined in the tree protection and replacement plan and are equal to or greater than 12 inches DBH, and are in areas where construction will occur inside the crown of the tree shall be required to have an enhanced protection program. In order to maximize the ability of the selected trees to survive construction the proposed program will include the following steps.
a.
The tree will be surveyed and located with the species and DBH noted and approximate crown diameter shown.
b.
Prior to the beginning of construction activities, the trees shall be inspected by a city approved arborist to determine their overall condition and ability to withstand construction activity around them.
c.
Should the city approved arborist determine that with a proper protection plan the tree would survive the construction activity the arborist shall prepare a care plan for the tree. The plan may involve elements such as crown pruning, fertilization, irrigation, root pruning or other activities.
d.
The contractor will be required to implement the arborist's protection plan and to maintain the necessary activities to protect the tree until such time as the site construction is completed and accepted for maintenance by the property owner. The city approved arborist shall submit bi-weekly reports to the contractor and the Department of Community Development during the construction process.
e.
The owner of the property shall receive a 20-percent bonus credit for canopy coverage for all trees that are under the enhanced protection program.
f.
No land disturbing activity or construction activity, including, but not limited to, grading, digging, soil disturbance or other activity within the critical root zone of any boundary tree, is permitted that will deprive the boundary tree of continued viability as determined by a certified arborist.
g.
The following parameters shall be followed when determining boundary tree viability interference:
1.
CRZ/TPZ 19 percent or less impact and protected by tree protection, no arboricultural prescription required.
2.
CRZ/TPZ 20 percent—33 percent impact but protected by tree protection (no structural root plate impact) provide arboricultural prescription with a plan for review by the city.
3.
CRZ/TPZ 20 percent—33 percent impact and structural root plate has impact/not protected.
h.
The builder/developer/construction site property owner must submit a boundary tree agreement signed by the tree owner/co-owner and notarized giving permission for the tree that has construction impact to be treated or removed (see Community Development Department for the city boundary tree agreement). The minimum time length of the boundary tree agreement shall be three years. The receipt for the paid arboricultural prescription and signed agreement will need to be submitted with the plans for review.
1.
The builder/developer/construction site owner must make at least three attempts to contact the owner of the boundary tree to enact a boundary tree agreement. The first two attempts may be in person or via telephone. The third attempt must be in the form of a written letter sent certified, return receipt requested to the property owner's address of record in the county tax database. If there is no response to any of the attempts, the builder/developer/construction site owner shall provide evidence to the city of the attempts at contact in addition to the arboriculture prescription for the affected tree.
2.
If no boundary tree agreement is reached, the affected tree shall not be removed but shall be protected during development based on this chapter and in accordance with the arboriculture prescription.
3.
A boundary tree bond or escrow account may be required based on the arboricultural prescription depending on the impact to a boundary tree covered under a boundary tree agreement.
4.
A boundary tree bond or escrow account shall be required where a boundary tree agreement cannot be reached.
5.
A boundary tree bond or escrow shall be 125 percent of the cost of removal and replacement of the tree(s) affected and will be held for three years by the city. The property owner of the affected tree(s) may apply to the city for the escrow funds to remove and replace the tree(s) during the three-year escrow period. If the boundary tree(s) is/are deemed healthy at the end of the three-year period by an arborist, the developer may apply to the city for a refund of the original amount of escrow.
6.
The site/landscape plans cannot be approved without signed boundary tree agreement(s) or proof of attempts to contact the boundary tree owner in an attempt to reach a boundary tree agreement in addition to an arboriculture prescription where needed.
(g)
Seasonal planting. Final plat approval or a certificate of occupancy may be issued prior to the establishment of trees planned to meet the tree canopy cover requirements, if the Community Development Director or their designee determines that the season is inappropriate for planting. In such cases the trees shall be planted by the last day of February following the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final plat approval. If they have not been planted by the last day of February following the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final plat approval, the permit holder shall be considered to be in violation of the provisions of this article.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019; Ord. No. 14-2019 , 11-4-2019; Ord. No. 09-2021 , § III, 9-7-2021; Ord. No. 04-2022 , § I, 7-5-2022)
Sec. 205-6. - Tree bank.
The intent of the requirements of this section is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/ or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The tree bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the Director before the tree bank may be used. The tree bank provides two options, which are described in full below.
(1)
Option one, planting trees off-site. Install an equal amount of required tree density units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case the following criteria shall be observed:
a.
The tree preservation board has identified alternate "option one" sites. The Community Development Department has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the tree bank. Persons wishing to use option one should consult with the UDO Administrator to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the UDO Administrator with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited.
b.
The developer shall submit a tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be two inches caliper at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required each tree must be three inches caliper at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan.
c.
If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that the owner agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan.
d.
Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one-year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition.
(2)
Option two, monetary compensation for trees. A developer may choose to provide the city with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed:
a.
Provide tree density calculations on the tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan. Show the total amount of tree density units that cannot be met on-site.
b.
Multiply the tree density units that cannot be met on-site by the monetary compensation value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan. Contact city approved certified arborist or landscape architect for the current monetary compensation value.
c.
Provide a certified check made payable to the city in the amount of the product as listed in item (2) above and as provided on the tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan. Submit the certified check to a UDO Administrator along with a copy of the approved tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan.
d.
The monies collected for the tree bank option two may be used by the city for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, libraries, and other similar community facilities. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the Director.
(3)
Standards for administering these alternative compliance methods. The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement. The site development permit shall be issued after the Director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds.
(4)
Exclusions. Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the tree bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum tree density units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the tree bank in accordance with option one or option two above.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
Sec. 205-7. - Redevelopment sites.
(a)
For redeveloped sites the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends the developer, authorized registered professionals, design professionals and staff schedule a pre-submittal meeting with the department to discuss the potential of the site and any issues that may be present on the site.
(b)
Redeveloped sites shall comply with the buffer and specimen tree requirements as set forth in this UDO and provide compliance with parking lot, landscape strip and tree density unit requirements.
(c)
Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25.1 percent or greater of the site area, a tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan is required. The plan shall show landscape strip planting, parking lot trees, tree density units, buffers and shall comply with the requirements of this UDO.
(d)
Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25 percent or less of the site area, a tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan is required. The plan shall include the existing and proposed landscape conditions that verify compliance with this UDO.
(1)
At a minimum the plan must show the following existing and proposed elements with intent to comply:
a.
Buffers.
b.
Landscape strips.
c.
Parking lot trees.
d.
Tree density units.
e.
Tree save areas.
(2)
Director shall review the proposed tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan.
(e)
Disturbance on a redevelopment site shall include a building replacement where the footprint of the building counts toward the site disturbance.
(Ord. No. 08-2019 , § I, 6-3-2019)
