The use or occupation of this building (property) for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use is prohibited and unlawful."
(f)
If the owner fails to comply with any order to remove or demolish the dwelling, building, fence, wall or structure, or to clean up the property, the judge may cause such dwelling, building, fence, wall or structure to be removed or demolished; or the property to be cleaned provided, however, that the duties of the judge set forth in subsection (e) of this section and this subsection, shall not be exercised until the City Council shall have by ordinance ordered the judge to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article with respect to the particular property which the judge shall have found to be unfit for human habitation or unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, which property shall be described in this article.
(g)

(2)
Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred, or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest at any time prior to the termination of the said three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city.
(3)
Should the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, be unpaid after the passage of such three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subsection (h)(2) of this section, the city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for alteration, repair, removal, or demolition of dwellings, buildings, or structure or cleanup of property as provided by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358 and other applicable state statutes.
