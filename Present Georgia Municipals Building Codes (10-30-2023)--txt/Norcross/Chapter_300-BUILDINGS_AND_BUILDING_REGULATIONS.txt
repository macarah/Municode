Special requirements for areas denoted as national and local historic district. The identity of Norcross is closely tied to the existing character and appearance of properties within the national and local historic districts as well as other older properties within the city. It is important that the character established by existing buildings be continued in new construction through appropriate massing, scale, setback and building form. Therefore, it is the intent of the city to conserve the traditional historic, architectural and landscape character of the national and local historic districts, as well as the city in general, through the requirement that any structure in either district that is approved for demolition or deconstruction be replicated for exterior form and style on reconstruction. Information on form and style will come from city and county records.

Sec. 307-6.1. - Deconstruction requirements.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for deconstruction requirements for the deconstruction of Norcross' older and more historic primary dwelling structures. In particular, through the enactment and enforcement of this section for primary residential structures constructed prior to 1950 according to city records or if city records are unavailable, according to county tax or appraisal records, the city seeks to:
(1)
Maximize the salvage of valuable building materials, especially old-growth structural lumber, for reuse, thereby supporting the city's goal of being a sustainable community.
(2)
Reduce the amount of demolition waste disposed of in landfills, thereby saving city and taxpayer dollars, extending the lives of existing landfills and reducing the need to create new landfills.
(3)
Reduce carbon emissions associated with demolition activity by preserving the embodied carbon and energy of existing building materials and avoiding the creation of greenhouse gasses associated with producing new materials.
(4)
Minimize the adverse impacts associated with building or deconstruction by increasing the likelihood of discovering materials containing lead and asbestos for safe or deconstruction and disposal.
(5)
Reduce the releasing of dust and other hazardous or potentially hazardous airborne substances.
(6)
Preserve Norcross' historic architectural features and building materials.
(b)
Definitions. In this section:
(1)
"Deconstruction" means the systematic dismantling of a structure, or portion thereof, to maximize the salvage of materials for reuse, in preference over salvaging materials for recycling, energy recovery, or sending the materials to the landfill.
(2)
"Primary dwelling structure" means a residential structure containing one to two dwelling units based on current permitted occupancy at the time of demolition permit application. This term does not include an accessory building such as a garage or shed.
(3)
"Recycling" means the processing of waste materials into new products or material feed stock for products. Materials that can be recycled include, but are not limited to, concrete, metal piping, and asphalt roofing shingles.
(4)
"Responsible party" means any owner or person in control of a primary dwelling structure, or that owner or person's authorized agent.
(5)
"Reuse" means the use of a product or material that was previously installed for the same or similar function to extend its life cycle. Materials salvageable for reuse include but are not limited to cabinets, doors, windows, hardware, fixtures, flooring, siding, and framing lumber.
(c)
Rules. Primary dwelling structures shall be deconstructed in accordance with the provisions of this section and associated administrative rules. Salvaged material may be sold, donated or reused on- or off-site.
