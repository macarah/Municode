Temporary outdoor activity means the sale of retail merchandise associated with seasonal/holiday activities, the operation of a carnival, or sale of farm produce, occurring on a commercially zoned lot with a minimum of two acres in size, which is vacant or which contains a separate and distinct primary use from the merchandise being sold.
