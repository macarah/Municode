Sec. 16-42.002. - Findings and statement of intent.
The city finds that the Intown South area, containing NPUs S, T and V, and located within Atlanta City Council District 4, as a unique mix of residential neighborhoods, historic districts and structures, institutional uses and commercial corridors. Intown South is experiencing an over-proliferation of flea markets and convenience stores concentrated in economically depressed and blighted areas and contributing to the depression of these areas while simultaneously discouraging the development of more economically viable and diverse commercial activities. In establishing this overlay district, the city intends to anticipate, and restrict or encourage development, as may be appropriate, in a manner that: (i) is consistent with the comprehensive development plan; and (ii) provides for the continued existence of currently permitted and operating commercial activities which fit into the use categories regulated herein.
