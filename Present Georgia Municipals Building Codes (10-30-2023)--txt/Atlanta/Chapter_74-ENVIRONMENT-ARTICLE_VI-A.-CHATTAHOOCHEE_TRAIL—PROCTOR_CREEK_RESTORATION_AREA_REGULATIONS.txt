ARTICLE VI-A. - CHATTAHOOCHEE TRAIL—PROCTOR CREEK RESTORATION AREA REGULATIONS

Sec. 74-275. - Intent, revision of policy and disclaimer.
(a)
Intent. In order to support the restoration for a specific area adjacent to the Chattahoochee River, between Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway and I-285, the intent of this article is to modify the application of the floodplain ordinance set forth in article VI of this chapter 74 to allow the level of activities which would otherwise be allowed by state and federal law.
(b)
Statement of Policy. Within both traditional and historically modified floodplain areas, the city has restricted all activities even those which state and federal law would otherwise allow. While this policy has protected life and property, prevented or minimized the hazards and damage which follow periods of severe inundation and reduced certain public costs, in certain areas of the city, revision of these restrictions has been found to be warranted where it is possible to protect the natural function and character of the traditional floodplain and surrounding areas as is required under state and federal law to explore future uses.
(1)
The city finds that special consideration, to ensure that the restoration of properties within walking distance of the Chattahoochee River in the Restoration Area, is crucial to promote and ensure the public health, safety and welfare, provide amenities for visitors, attract the investment necessary to make such improvements possible and spur further efforts in other areas.
(2)
By allowing the restoration of flood areas such as that which will be authorized for the Chattahoochee Trail-Proctor Creek Restoration Area (the "restoration area"), whether in whole or in part, through the installation of new private water control infrastructure that can meet the requirements of state and federal law, it becomes possible to revitalize areas of the city in or adjacent to the redevelopment area because of the increased quality of life, offered by its aesthetic and recreational value of the close proximity to the Chattahoochee River.
(3)
The city further finds that as the restoration area attracts new investment for the installation of water control infrastructure, the character of future growth therein and in adjacent areas can be designed to support the development of greenspace that will have a positive impact on communities in the area and the city as a whole.
(4)
The city further finds that the construction of trails, including trails with elevated structures, in the restoration area can play a vital role in connecting communities, provide enhanced recreational options for citizens and visitors, make large amounts of greenspace available for enjoyment at minimal cost, and make it possible for more citizens and visitors to enjoy the Chattahoochee River by making it more accessible will have a positive impact on communities in the area and the city as a whole.
(5)
By establishing the redevelopment area, the city intends to institute a regulatory approach that protects the natural function and character of the traditional floodplain and surrounding areas as is required under state and federal law and manages anticipates, manages, and encourages quality restoration of the banks of the Chattahoochee River.
(c)
Disclaimer of liability. The Atlanta City Council finds the degree of flood protection provided by this article is reasonable and consistent with historically established and nationally accepted levels of protection based on scientific and engineering practices, even though larger floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes and even though more stringent restrictions may apply in other parts of the city. This article VI-A does not imply that land outside the floodway, traditional floodplain, historically modified floodplain, special flood hazard area, or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article VI-A shall not create liability on the part of the city or any elected official, officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

Sec. 74-277. - Definitions.
The definitions set forth in section 74-203 are adopted as definitions for the use of this article VI-A; provided however that should any existing definition in said section be amended or any new definition be added which would prevent the water control infrastructure or greenspace and trails which would otherwise be allowed under applicable federal and state law, such definition shall be applied to this article VI-A in a manner which would allow such land development, land development activity, land development project or infrastructure (collectively for the purpose of this article VI-A, the "regulated activities").
( Ord. No. 2021-61(21-O-0719) , § 1, 12-15-21)
Sec. 74-278. - Permits required.
(a)
None of the regulated activities described in this article which require an approval under federal or state law, including but not limited to section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334 and the Metropolitan River Protection Act ("MRPA"), codified at O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et. seq shall commence until such permits and a building permit from the city have been obtained.
(1)
Permits from United States Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE"). Any review of the regulated activities described in this article VI-A which require a review under section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334 and a permit issued by USACE shall be completed and the permit prior to further requests for the city to process other permits required.
(2)
Metropolitan River Protection Act Certificate ("MRPA Certificate"). Applications for a MRPA Certificate or revisions to an application already submitted shall be reviewed for completeness within a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days, and either approved for submittal to the Atlanta Regional Commission or returned to the applicant with notations which state why such application cannot be submitted.
(3)
City building permit application. Use of lands and buildings, and construction, reconstruction, repair, modification or demolition of any structure and / or any regulated activities, within all floodplains, including special flood hazard areas, which have received a MRPA certificate, shall also require review and approval of a permit by the commissioner or a designee who shall apply the standards set forth in this article, notwithstanding those limitations set forth elsewhere in this chapter. When article VI would otherwise prohibit regulated activities that would be allowed by this article VI-A, the permission granted by this article VI-A shall control, so long as compliance with applicable federal and state law is maintained.
(b)
Flood study or field run survey required. The Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps, more particularly described in section 74-202, adopted by the city are used for general reference purposes only. A flood study or a field run survey may be required to determine the location and extent of the floodplain area on a specific parcel.
(1)
Flood study. In an unmapped floodplain or in a mapped floodplain where elevation has not been established, a flood study may be required in order to establish the base flood elevation. Such a flood study shall address, at a minimum, impact to upstream, downstream and adjacent properties, and the free flow of flood waters.
(2)
Field run survey. In order to establish the horizontal extent of the vertical floodplain elevation, a field run survey may be required to establish the actual location of the limit when the proposed regulated activity is within the limits of a floodplain/floodway.
(3)
A flood study or field run survey required under this subsection shall be certified by either a professional engineer or registered land surveyor.
(c)
Review and approval. The commissioner shall authorize the approval of any city building permit for such regulated activities upon a finding, based on detailed plans and specifications submitted with the application for city building permit, that the regulated activity can be completed and occupied or used in accord with the permission granted by any federal or state permit as required in this article VI-A and pursuant to city Code. No part of any such regulated activity shall be commenced before such permit approval has been issued and all other permits and licenses required by applicable law have been issued or obtained.
(d)
Protection of existing flood storage and from protection from flooding. The commissioner shall not, by authorizing the approval of a permit under the authority of this article, authorize any use of land, where the effect thereof would be to decrease the volume of existing flood storage on that land or to increase flooding conditions upstream, downstream or adjacent to that land.
(1)
Protection of floodways. The floodway shall be that as defined in the flood insurance study, City of Atlanta, Georgia, Fulton and DeKalb County, Federal Emergency Management Agency, revised June 22, 1998, and as it may be subsequently revised or extended. On those watercourses and rivers regulated hereunder where the floodway has not been defined in the said flood insurance study and until such time as these watercourses and rivers are defined in an officially adopted or revised flood insurance study, the floodway shall be defined as the channel of the watercourse or river and the adjacent areas of the defined or undefined floodplain that must be reserved in order to discharge the 100-year base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot upstream of, downstream of, or at the point being considered. Except as a part of a plan approved by the commissioner and as allowed by federal and state law, no fill or encroachments shall be permanently placed within the defined floodway that would impair the ability to carry and discharge the waters resulting from the 100-year base flood.
(2)
Floodplain protection. Land development, land development activities or land development projects in the floodplain shall be permitted only when the resulting configuration results in no loss of existing flood volume. Any land development, land development activities or land development projects activities within the floodplain shall be subject to requirements of stream bank buffer limits and should be constructed using best management practices for soil erosion and sedimentation control. The use of compensating excavation or contouring; procedures to modify flood hazard limits may apply to install necessary public roadway and utilities within the flood limits to support existing and new development or to restore riparian buffer areas.
(3)
All applications for permits issued by the commissioner which would allow any use or construction wholly or partly in a special flood hazard area shall include detailed plans and specifications which demonstrate that no expansion of a special flood hazard area would result from the work which would be authorized by any such permit. Any comments or requirements endorsed on such plans and specifications or on an addendum thereto, by the commissioner shall become a part of any permit issued for the work covered by the plans and specifications and shall be enforced as are all other requirements applicable to such permit.
