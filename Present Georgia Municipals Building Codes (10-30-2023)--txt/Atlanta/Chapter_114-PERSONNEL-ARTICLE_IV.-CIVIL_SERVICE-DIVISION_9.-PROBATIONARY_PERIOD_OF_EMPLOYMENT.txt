DIVISION 9. - PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT

Sec. 114-326. - Policy and objectives.
All appointments to regular fulltime or part-time positions in the classified service shall be subject to the satisfactory completion of a six month probationary period. Such probationary period shall constitute an integral part of the selection process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's work, for securing the most effective adjustment of a new or promoted employee to the position, for rejecting any employee whose performance or conduct is not satisfactory and for affording the employee an opportunity to determine if such employee wishes to make a career in the service of the city.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-327. - Extension of time.
The commissioner of human resources shall extend the probationary period for up to an additional six months upon the request of the applicable department head, provided such request is made prior to the expiration of the original probationary period.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-328. - Promotional appointments.
(a)
If an employee is removed during the probationary period following a promotion, for failure to perform satisfactorily the duties of the higher position, such employee may be returned to the position held prior to the promotion or to a similar position. Should an appropriate vacancy not exist, the employee may be allowed to remain in the position out of class until there is a vacancy in an existing position in the lower class. A probationary promotional appointment shall not affect an employee's earned regular status and rights in the classified service which have been acquired in another position.
(b)
Promotions of employees covered by this division shall be made only according to merit and fitness and must be attained by competitive examinations, regardless of the number of applicants seeking promotion. Such examinations shall be administered by the department of human resources. All promotions in the classified service, except those under section 114-251, shall be for a probationary period of six months. During the probationary period, the person so promoted may be demoted by the appointing authority to the position the person formerly held, without a hearing. Any person so demoted shall be credited with any pay adjustments that the person would have earned in the position formerly held by such person had such person not been promoted.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-329. - Position changes and transfers.
If a demotion, reassignment or transfer of an employee in the classified service occurs before such employee has completed the probationary period, the remainder of such probationary period shall be served in the new position, and such employee shall not be required to serve a new probationary period in the new position. A written report of such demotion, reassignment or transfer must be filed by the applicable appointing authority with the commissioner of human resources within three work days after the effective date of such action.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-330. - Reemployment.
Upon reemployment in a position in the classified service, an employee shall not be required to serve a new probationary period when such employee has completed, within the previous 12-months, a probationary period in the same class for which reemployment is being effected.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-331. - Dismissal during probationary period.
(a)
Any employee, during the probationary period, may be removed or dismissed, without the right of appeal to the civil service board, for the following reasons:
(1)
Such employee is unable or unwilling to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position or the lack of dependability of such employee does not merit continuance with the service, as determined by the appointing authority.
(2)
Such employee has committed an offense which would constitute cause for disciplinary action under this article.
(3)
The appointment of such employee was secured through fraud or fraudulent acts.
(b)
Upon removal or dismissal, as provided for in subsection (a) of this section, the appointing authority shall notify the commissioner of human resources and the employee in writing enumerating the reasons for the removal or dismissal.
(Ord. No. 2007-22(06-O-2700), § 1, 3-27-07)
Sec. 114-332. - Probationary period reports.
Prior to the end of the six-month probationary period, a written performance evaluation shall be conducted on the probationary employee if such employee is demoted or separated for unsatisfactory performance. The performance evaluation shall be signed by the appointing authority and submitted to the commissioner of human resources. If the commissioner of human resources is not notified prior to the expiration date of the probationary period, such employee shall acquire regular status in the position.
