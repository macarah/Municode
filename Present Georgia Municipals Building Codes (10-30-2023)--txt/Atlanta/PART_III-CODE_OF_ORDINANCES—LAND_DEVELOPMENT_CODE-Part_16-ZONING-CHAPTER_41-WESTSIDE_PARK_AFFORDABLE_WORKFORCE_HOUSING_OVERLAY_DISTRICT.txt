Sec. 16-41.002. - Findings and statement of intent.
Providing a range of affordable housing choices in the Westside Park Affordable Workforce Housing Overlay District is a difficult but vital objective. Housing shortages for persons of various income levels are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, causing detrimental transportation, environmental, business and social consequences. Furthermore, the creation of both rental and homeownership housing is desirable, and the use of qualified administrators to administer homeownership units lessens the cost and administrative burden for developers and the public alike. The purpose of this chapter is to increase the availability of housing choices for individuals and families earning at or below 60 percent or at or below 80 percent of the area median income ("AMI") as calculated and published annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Atlanta - Sandy Springs - Marietta metropolitan area.
Therefore, city policies that promote these objectives will serve to:
1.
Implement the goals, policies, and objectives contained in the city's comprehensive development plan;
2.
Ensure diverse housing options continue to be available for persons and/or households at or below AMI;
3.
Maintain a balanced community by encouraging the finite supply of developable land to provide housing opportunities appropriate to meet various needs and income levels;
4.
Ensure the availability of housing with better access to jobs in the city and thereby promoting household economic mobility through increased access to MARTA and other public transit;
5.
Improve the opportunity for working people to elevate their economic status;
6.
Encourage the construction of affordable workforce housing by offering zoning incentives for the provision of affordable workforce housing as a portion of residential development to address both existing and anticipated future housing needs in the Westside Park Affordable Workforce Housing Overlay District;
7.
Afford developers of residential development the flexibility to meet the broad objectives of the city's policies to assist in providing a percentage of affordable workforce housing units as a portion of development; and
8.
Provide opportunities to have on-site, privately produced, owned and managed, long-term affordable units.
