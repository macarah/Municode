The intent of the council in establishing the Inman Park Special Public Interest District is as follows:
(1)
To physically and architecturally reintegrate the Inman Park neighborhood by developing public park space and new low density housing in areas that were cleared as a result of public action for the construction of a freeway plan subsequently abandoned;
(2)
To provide for the development of new housing fronting on the public park, and to provide for open space, so as to protect views both to and from the public park and open space;
(3)
To assure that the development and management of this neighborhood public park and open space provides a passive, neighborhood park space, including neighborhood facilities such as a children's playground, but not including any regional facilities such as an amphitheater, in a manner consistent with the goals, objectives, and plans of the Freedom Park Concept Plan;
(4)
To provide for the development of single-family and limited two-family housing on lots so specified in this chapter in order to implement the goals and objectives of the City of Atlanta 1996 Comprehensive Development Plan and the Freedom Park Concept Plan;
(5)
To provide through the administration of specific standards and criteria that new housing achieve architectural and site design consistency with the Inman Park Historic District and Moreland Avenue Historic District which are listed in the United States Department of the Interior National Register of Historic Places;
(6)
To assure that in the process of knitting the neighborhood together through the construction of new housing and park space that the cumulative diversity which typifies the neighborhood is maintained through the prohibition of the repetition of any single-house design within the same block face and other reasonable design regulations that are intended to preserve and enhance the architectural and historic significance of this district; and
(7)
To encourage owner occupancy of new housing in single-family structures, while also offering limited opportunities for small rental apartment units within said structures.

In addition to the general regulations and provisions of this chapter, and except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the following architectural regulations shall apply to all residential subareas:
(1)
Definitions. For the purposes of interpreting this code section, the following definitions shall apply:
a.
Neighborhood means the Inman Park Neighborhood as it exists on the official neighborhood map of the City of Atlanta.
b.
Substantially proportional means that the element in question, such as roof pitch, scale, mass, or height, is sufficiently proportional to that found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to identify the new construction as originating from said architectural style.
c.
Substantially characteristic means that the material in question, such as brickwork, stonework, or roofing material, reflects visual qualities that are sufficiently characteristic of those found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to confirm that the new construction is consistent with said architectural style.
(2)
Statement of intent. The council finds that the following established residential architectural styles currently exist in the neighborhood and contribute to its unique historic character: Queen Anne; Folk Victorian; High Victorian Eclectic; Neoclassical Revival; Dutch Colonial Revival; Prairie; Stick; and Craftsman. The purpose of the following regulations is to set forth basic, minimum standards of architectural design and construction that are consistent with these existing historic styles of residences within the neighborhood, as the cumulative historic diversity of the built environment is a defining characteristic of this neighborhood. It is not the intent of these regulations to limit the design of new housing to replication of existing structures, but rather to foster residential design that incorporates the historic architectural elements and materials that are specific to the neighborhood in a meaningful, coherent manner. The following regulations are intended to achieve basic compatibility with these existing architectural styles while simultaneously encouraging consistent, creative designs that are more than a mere aggregation of random historic elements, through the use of specific standards and criteria. In addition, these regulations are intended to integrate the aesthetic and physical characteristics of new construction and landscape in this area into the existing neighborhood and public park areas in a meaningful way so as to restore and promote the public health, safety and welfare of this community.
(3)
Standards for criteria. The following standards and criteria shall apply to all new construction in the residential subareas:
a.
All new construction on each lot shall be representative of a single architectural style chosen from those styles set forth in subsection (2) above.
