Should any city employee who signed a valid enrollment dues authorization card wish to withdraw or terminate the deduction of dues from such employee's wages or salary, such employee may do so in the months of January or July of each year by submitting in writing to the office of the commissioner of human resources a statement to that effect.
(e)
The deduction of dues authorized in this section is conditioned upon the fact that any organization representing any employee or group of employees, any shop steward or any official of an organization or any of its members, individually or collectively, will not strike and will not approve or take part in any strike, sit-down, slow-down or any interference with the operation of the city by picketing, patrolling, demonstrating or any stoppage of work or other similar activities. Further, the deduction of dues is conditioned upon there being no campaigning or soliciting of membership on city property during working hours. Upon the occurrence of any of such actions or activities and upon a written determination by the mayor or the mayor's designee that such actions or activities are occurring, the deduction of dues from the salary or wages of the employees belonging to any such organization shall be automatically terminated by the commissioner of human resources, and recognition of that employee's organization shall be terminated.

The dues deduction of an employee shall not be made if the salary or wages of an employee at any pay period, after making all deductions required by law and previously authorized by the employee, should not equal the amount of such dues. Thereafter, such deductions shall commence, non-retroactive, upon there remaining after such deductions an amount of such employee's salary or wages equal to such dues. The dues deduction of an employee shall terminate when, for suspension, sickness or any leave of absence, such employee should receive in any dues deduction pay period an amount of money less than such employee's normal and regular salary. Such dues deduction shall thereafter commence, non-retroactive, upon such employee receiving in any dues deduction pay period such employee's normal and regular wages or salary.

Such a petition shall be presented to the commissioner of human resources only during the first quarter of the calendar year for certification by the commissioner of human resources. Support of employees shall be demonstrated by signed and dated authorization cards as defined in paragraph (a). Should the commissioner of human resources verify the showing of interest, the organization submitting the showing of interest, upon approval by council, will become the recognized employee organization for the employees in the community of interest for which representation is sought at the beginning of the third quarter of the calendar year in which the showing of interest is submitted. At such time, any existing employee organization previously recognized for employees in the community of interest will no longer be recognized and authorization cards for the former employee organization will become null and void. No other petition for certification for the same community of interest will be accepted for a period of four years after the date of certification under this paragraph.
