(a)
In general.
(1)
For this code to be most effective, the public and city officials must have access to a fair, expedient, effective and evolving complaint process that is not encumbered by the need to amend this code. To that end, the commission is to develop, publish and maintain a complaint policy that explains procedures to be followed, timeframes to be honored and the roles, responsibilities and rights of the complainant, city official alleged to have violated this code and members of the commission.
(2)
The policy may include steps, options or requirements beyond the general provisions contained in this chapter. If, at any point in time, such policy does not address the requirements of a particular complaint, the commission is to make formal adjustment to the policy to ensure the fair and appropriate handling of the complaint and such complaints thereafter.

The essential components of the complaint policy are outlined in the following provisions of this section.
(b)
Restraints. The policy is to specify the restraints, if any, that apply to the commission, the complaint and/or the person against whom a complaint is filed (the respondent).

To discourage the filing of ethics complaints solely for political purposes, complaints may not be accepted against any person, whether currently serving as a city official or not, from 90 days prior to the beginning of the qualifying process for the elected office at issue through the date the election results for that office are certified. The time for filing complaints will not run during this period. Properly filed complaints will be accepted and processed after the election results have been certified.

A disqualified complaint declaration is to be returned to the complainant and otherwise dealt with in a manner consistent with the complaint policy.

The commission is to inform (by registered mail) the respondent of the complaint and of a reply due date and a case review date. The complaint and other pertinent documents are to be attached to this correspondence.
(3)
The complaint policy is to provide details for handling a case for which the respondent agrees that he or she has violated this code.
(4)
Unless the respondent's reply agrees that a violation occurred, there is to be a case review to determine whether specific substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there was a violation of this code. The case is to be dismissed unless a majority of the voting panel agrees that such evidence exists. The complaint policy is to provide details for closing a dismissal.
(5)
If the case is not dismissed, the commission is to hold a hearing at a public meeting for the purposes of reaching a complaint opinion (decision) as to whether or not the respondent violated the code. The hearing is to be conducted in accordance with those conventionally associated with hearings at public meetings. The complainant and the respondent are to have the opportunity to be heard and to have witnesses at the hearing.
(6)
After the hearing, voting panel members are to reach a decision (complaint opinion) as to whether or not the respondent violated this code. Such decision is to be based on:
a.
Preponderance or greater weight of the evidence presented at the hearing; and
b.
The declarations submitted by the complainant and respondent; and
c.
Panel member's conscientious and compliant interpretation and application of this code to the evidence.
(7)
The complaint opinion is to be documented consistent with the complaint policy. This documentation is to include a statement of remedial or consequential actions that the commission deems appropriate. Such actions may be applicable to the respondent or to the complainant. Consequences for a city official may include, but are not limited to, private warning, training on the subject of the violation, public warning or reprimand, public censure and/or apology and/or restitution. Consequences for a malicious or frivolous complaint from a person other than a city official may include misdemeanor charges.
(8)
The documented opinion is to be forwarded to clerk of council who will distribute the opinion to council members, the complainant, the respondent and the city attorney in preparation for a final and concluding action on the part of council.
(f)
A person (complainant) alleging that the city manager, the city attorney, the city clerk, or a municipal court judge violated any provision of his code may submit a written and signed complaint to the mayor and council. The mayor and council shall consider such complaint and follow the procedure for investigation and holding a hearing in the same or similar fashion as the ethics commission as set forth in subparagraphs (e)(1)—(7) hereinabove.
