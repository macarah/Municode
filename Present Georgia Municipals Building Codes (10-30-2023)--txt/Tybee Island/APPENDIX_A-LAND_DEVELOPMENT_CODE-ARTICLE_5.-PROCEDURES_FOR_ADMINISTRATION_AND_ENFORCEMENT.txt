Sec. 5-020. - Permits or actions required by this Land Development Code.
The following are permits or actions that may be required depending on the construction and particular land use district for which it will take place.
(A)
Special review permits. There are specific land uses permitted in certain zoning districts only after a review by the planning commission, a public hearing has been held by the mayor and council, and the mayor and council has determined that the use is appropriate based on certain criteria. These uses are listed throughout article 4 and the criteria listed in section 5-070. See section 5-040(A) and (B), and section 5-070.
(B)
Site plan approval. All land development activities other than residential one and two-family structures, regardless of the zoning district, must present a site plan of such development to the planning commission for review, and to the mayor and council for approval prior to the issuance of any land development permits. In the C-1 zoning district, all land-disturbing activities require site plan approval. See section 5-040(A) and (C), and section 5-080.
(C)
Zoning variance. Where strict enforcement of this Land Development Code may present an unnecessary hardship upon a lot or parcel of land, the owner may apply for a zoning variance. Such action requires a public hearing by the planning commission and approval by the mayor and council at a scheduled meeting. See section 5-040(A) and (D), and section 5-090.
(D)
Amendment to the zoning map. An amendment to the zoning map is considered to be an amendment to this Land Development Code. Such action requires a hearing by the planning commission and approval by the mayor and council at a scheduled public hearing. See section 5-040(A) and (E), and section 5-110.
(E)
Amendment to the text of this Land Development Code. An amendment to the text of this Land Development Code follows the same process as an amendment to the zoning map. However, a text amendment requires different materials to be included with the application. See section 5-040(A) and (E), and section 5-110.
(F)
Subdivision of land. Whenever a lot, parcel, or tract of land is divided into two or more parts, the owner must submit a preliminary subdivision plat to the zoning administrator. The preliminary plat shall be reviewed at a hearing held by the planning commission. The preliminary plat will be reviewed at a scheduled meeting of the mayor and council. Once the preliminary plat is approved by mayor and council, required infrastructure improvements may be permitted on the property. After the required infrastructure improvements are completed and inspected by the building inspector, a final plat may be submitted to the zoning administrator. The final plat shall be reviewed at a hearing held by the planning commission. The final plat will then be reviewed following a scheduled meeting of the mayor and council. Once the final plat is approved by the mayor and council, all parcels created by the subdivision may be recorded in the office of the Superior Court of Chatham County and subsequently become real estate. See section 5-040(A) and (G), and sections 5-130, 5-140 and 5-150.
(G)
Sign permit approval. All signs erected, and signs which are altered or repaired at a cost of 50 percent of the replacement value unless specifically exempted by this Land Development Code, must be permitted by the city. All signs not specifically exempted from the permit and/or licensing requirement of this Land Development Code shall be permitted by the city. An application for a permit shall be submitted to the zoning administrator and accompanied by plans and specifications of the sign in all its structural parts, and by accurate information designating the exact location of the proposed sign for review by the planning commission and approval by the mayor and council. The zoning administrator shall collect a standard fee for each permit and/or license at the time the permit or license is issued. See section 5-120, and article 6.
(H)
Use of recreational vehicles on private property for residential purposes. This is a temporary permit issued by the zoning administrator during normal hours of operation at the city hall. See general provisions section 3-110(C) for restrictions.
(I)
Permits required in conjunction with permits in this Land Development Code. The following are permits required by other government entities that may be applicable to a development project in Tybee Island:
(1)
Land-disturbing permit. Under the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7), any major subdivision of land over 1 1/10 of an acre for single-family development and any construction within 200 feet of state waters requires a land-disturbing permit from the department of natural resources, environmental protection division (EPD).
(2)
Dune crossover. The state department of natural resources (DNR) maintains dune delineation lines and suspected wetland areas. In these places DNR provides revocable permits for private docks and dune crossovers.
(3)
Dock permits and construction in wetlands. In conjunction with Georgia DNR, the United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains the authority to delineate the location of wetlands and is responsible for permitting any land-disturbing activity in them under section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act.
(4)
Individual well and sewer systems. If a lot or parcel is not served by city water and sewer utilities a permit is required from the Chatham County Board of Health. There are only a few areas on the island not served by both.
(5)
Entrances on state and federal highways (curb cuts). If the development of a lot, tract, or parcel requires an entrance onto a state or federal highway, a permit is required by the state department of transportation.
(6)
Shallow wells for irrigation only. If a property owner decides to use a shallow well for the irrigation of his or her landscape, a well drilling permit must be obtained from the city code enforcement department and the pump installation and design must meet the plumbing codes set forth in article 9 of this Land Development Code.

(Ord. No. 40-2011, 10-13-2011)
Sec. 5-050. - Public notice.
After a completed application has been filed, the next step in the approval process for a zoning action or subdivision of land required by this Land Development Code is to set a date for a public hearing on the matter and render proper notice to the public. Proper public hearing notice procedures are as follows:
(A)
Legal notice. Notice of public hearings before the planning commission and the mayor and council as required by this section shall be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the city in which are carried the legal advertisements of the city and shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing and shall also include the location of property that is the subject of the zoning action, the present zoning district of said property, and the proposed zoning district or proposed zoning action of said property. Such notice for the official public hearing before the mayor and council shall be published at least 15 days; but, not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing.
(B)
Signs posted. Where a zoning action of property is initiated, a designated official of the city shall post a sign at least 15 days prior to the mayor and council public hearing, in a conspicuous place on the property for which an application for a proposed zoning action has been submitted. The sign or signs will contain information as to the current zoning district, the proposed zoning district or zoning action, and the date, time and location of the public hearings before the planning commission and the mayor and council.
(C)
Notification to adjacent property owners. At least 15 days, but not more than 45 days before the scheduled public hearing, the zoning administrator shall notify all neighboring property owners, either adjacent to the property proposed for rezoning, or directly across a public street/road from that property. The notice shall include the location of the property, its present zoning classification and the proposed zoning classification. Failure of the zoning administrator to send notices or failure of the property owner to receive notification shall not affect the validity of any zoning action. This procedure exists as a supplement to the legally required notification procedures.
Sec. 5-060. - Public hearing requirements.
Whenever a zoning action or subdivision procedures take place, a hearing must be held before the public. When an applicant requires more than one zoning action or subdivision procedure for a development project, a separate public hearing must be held for each procedure or action. In Tybee Island there are two public hearings held for each zoning action or subdivision procedure; one before the planning commission and the other before the mayor and council. The public hearing before the mayor and council is by record the official public hearing. The purpose of each public hearing is to discuss information pertinent to the particular action or procedure. During the hearing the following rules and actions shall be followed:
(A)

(1)
The public hearing shall be called to order by the presiding officer.
(2)
The presiding officer shall explain the procedures to be followed in the conduct of the public hearing.
(3)
If the subject of the hearing is initiated by an applicant other than the mayor and council, the petitioner requesting such zoning decision, or the applicant's agent, shall be recognized first and shall be permitted to present and explain the request for the zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak regarding the zoning decision.
(4)
If the request is initiated by the mayor and council, all members of the council shall be allowed to speak as they are recognized by the mayor or presiding officer. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak regarding the zoning decision.
(5)
When any person wishes to speak at a public hearing, he shall raise his hand and, after being recognized by the presiding officer, shall stand and give his name, address, and make any comment appropriate to the proposed zoning decision. If within two years immediately preceding the filing of the applicant's application for a zoning action, the speaker has made campaign contributions aggregating to more than $250.00 to any member of the mayor and council or any member of the city planning commission, it shall be the duty of the speaker to disclose the following information five days prior to the official public hearing:

(B)
Actions specific to the planning commission during a public hearing. In all zoning actions in the city the planning commission is a recommending body and all final decisions must be made by the mayor and council. However, the planning commission has an important role in the public hearing process. This role is as follows:
(1)
All proposed zoning actions shall be reviewed by the planning commission in a public hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (A) of this section;
(2)
The planning commission shall review and consider a recommendation to the mayor and council with respect to the application for a zoning action. The planning commission may decide to make no recommendation or it may make any of the following recommendations with respect to an application for a zoning action; approval, denial, deferral, withdrawal without prejudice, reduction of the land area for which the application is made, change of the zoning district requested, or imposition of zoning conditions; and,
(3)
The planning commission shall submit its recommendation on a zoning action application to the mayor and council prior to the scheduled public hearing in which the mayor and council will consider the application for a zoning decision. If the planning commission fails to submit a recommendation prior to the public hearing, the planning commission's recommendation shall be deemed one of approval.
(C)
Actions specific to the mayor and council during a public hearing.
(1)
Before taking action on a proposed amendment and after receipt of the planning commission recommendations and reports thereon, the mayor and council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment at their next scheduled meeting.

b.
Reduce the land area for which the application is made;
c.
Change the zoning district to one other than that requested; or,
d.
Add or delete zoning conditions as the mayor and council deems appropriate.
(3)
An action to defer a decision on the proposed amendment shall include a specific meeting date to which the proposed amendment is deferred. The mayor and council may also approve a withdrawal of an application, and if so stipulated by the mayor and council in its decision to approve withdrawal, the 12-month limitation on re-filing of the application for the same property shall not apply.
(D)
Public hearings records standards. The city clerk or an agent of the city clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the mayor and council for its records.

Sec. 5-070. - Standards for special review.
Land uses listed in Article 4 of this Land Development Code that are permitted after special review must follow an administrative procedure prior to the issuance of any land development permit.
(A)
Review criteria. The planning commission shall hear and make recommendation upon such uses in a district that are permitted after special review. The application to establish such use shall be approved by the mayor and council on a finding that:
(1)
The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this Land Development Code;
(2)
The proposed use will not be contrary to the findings and recommendations of the master plan;
(3)
The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood or adversely affect the health and safety of residents and workers;
(4)
The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement associated with the use, noise or fumes generated by or as a result of the use, or type of physical activity associated with the land use;
(5)
The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses of adjacent properties;
(6)
The proposed use will be placed on a lot which is of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use;
(7)
The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted will be met.
(B)
Additional mitigation requirements. The planning commission may suggest and the mayor and council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (i.e., increased setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.):
(1)
As may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community; and
(2)
To protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood.
(C)
Adherence to requirements. Provided that wherever the mayor and council shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, noncompliance of any term, condition, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted, the mayor and council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
(D)
Permit longevity. If a building permit or other preparations or conditions are required prior to implementing special review approval granted by the mayor and council such permitting or other preparations or conditions must occur within 12 months from the date of special review approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by planning commission and mayor and council. In the event of a hardship or other extenuating circumstance the permit holder may apply to the designated city official for a one-time extension of permit approval. Permit extensions may not be approved in extenuating circumstances for a period of no more than 180 days. Should the permit not be exercised in the extension period it will expire.
(Ord. No. 05-2013, 1-10-2013)
Sec. 5-080. - Site plan approval.
The site plan approval process is intended to provide the general public, planning commission, and mayor and council with information pertinent to how a new development will affect the surrounding area and the city as a whole and to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and considerations as hereinafter stated. Where a variance, special review, or any other land development activity is involved in connection with a site plan, the standards applicable to the variance, special review, and/or land development activity applied for shall apply.
(A)
Process. Upon submittal of the site plan, the designated city official will review the site plan for noticeable discrepancies and determine if there is a need to apply for other zoning actions. The site plan is then forwarded to the city's consulting engineer. Once the engineer has submitted comments to the designated city official, a public hearing before the planning commission shall be scheduled. The public hearing shall be held regardless of whether the site plan meets the requirements of this Land Development Code. Until the applicant addresses all of the engineer's comments and the site plan is satisfactory, the mayor and council will not consider the plan.
In addition to all other requirements, any applicant for a site plan must identify all prior site plan applications made by the applicant, any affiliates/relatives, corporate or business entities in which the applicant has had an interest for the property which is the subject matter of the current application.
The applicant must identify any parking meters proposed to be eliminated from city rights-of-way by the proposed site plan implementation.
The applicant must demonstrate compliance with all other applicable ordinances including but not limited to stormwater, flood damage prevention, and buffering.
In considering a site plan, the mayor and council may consider whether the proposed development will be unreasonably detrimental to adjacent or nearby uses and whether the proposed development will adversely impact existing conditions in the overall neighborhood, including but not limited to:
(1)
The impact or lack thereof on available resources and utilities.
(2)
Whether the proposed development is of a scale and mass so as to be compatible with the character of the neighborhood.
(3)
Whether the proposed development is consistent with the character area under the master plan.
(4)
Density considerations for the neighborhood including demands on infrastructure, traffic, and other relevant factors.
In considering a site plan, the mayor and council may approve or deny the application as submitted, or add or delete conditions appropriate to protecting the interest of the applicant as well as those of nearby properties. Buffering requirements beyond those expressly identified may also be imposed. If conditions are added or deleted the applicant must subsequently submit a revised plan of the proposed development to the designated city official and all such conditions that had been added or deleted must be accepted by the city's consulting engineer.
If all of the foregoing requirements have been satisfied and further if the mayor and council find that the benefits of and need for the proposed use and project are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties, the application may be granted.
(B)
Other zoning actions. Because special review, variances and map amendments require site plans, site plan review may be the first step in the permitting process, however, the site plan should identify any other zoning actions necessary in order for the intended development to be constructed so that a public hearing can be held on all such zoning actions simultaneously with the public hearing on the site plan. Site plan approval should encompass approval of all other zoning actions necessary to accomplish the development, however, if the intended development is to be altered from an approved site plan, additional public hearing and review is necessary if an additional special review, variance or map amendment is necessitated by the proposed alteration.
(C)
Site plan longevity. After a site plan has been approved by the mayor and council it shall be valid for a period of 18 months from the date of approval. If a building permit has not been obtained and work has not begun, the site plan approval shall be void and a new application must be submitted for site plan approval.

Sec. 5-090. - Variances.
(A)
Standards. After an application has been submitted to the designated city official, reviewed by the planning commission, and a public hearing has been held by the mayor and council, the mayor and council may grant a variance from the strict application of the provisions in this Land Development Code only if a physical circumstance, condition, or consideration exists as described in subsection (1).
(1)
There are unique physical circumstances or conditions or considerations beyond that of surrounding properties, including a substandard lot of record that existed prior to March 24, 1971 (see section 3-040); irregularity; narrowness; or shallowness of the lot shape; or exceptional topographical or other physical circumstances, conditions, or considerations related to the environment, or to safety, or to historical significance, that is peculiar to the particular property; and;
(2)
Because of such physical circumstances or conditions or considerations, the property cannot be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this Land Development Code, without undue hardship to the property.
(3)
A nonconforming use or structure does not constitute a unique physical circumstance, condition, or consideration.
(B)
Height. No part of any structure shall project beyond 35-feet above the average adjacent grade of a property except:
(1)
See section 2-010, terms and definitions; height of building.
(2)
The following items that were existing on the date of the adoption of this section; flag poles, television aerials, water towers and tanks, steeples and bell towers, broadcasting and relay towers, transmission line towers, and electric substation structures.
(C)
Variance longevity. After a variance has been granted by the mayor and council it shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by the mayor and council.
(D)
Reviewing variance applications. The designated city official, planning commission, and governing body, shall consider the factors stated herein in reviewing variance applications in taking action on a particular variance. In exercising the powers to grant variances, the mayor and council may attach any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to accomplish the reasonable application of the requirements of these regulations.
(E)
Application approval. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code of Ordinances, the designated city official may approve applications for variances without the need of public hearings and without the need of review by the planning commission or the mayor and council as follows:
(1)
When either of the following circumstances exists:
a.
The proposed improvement or alteration will not result in an expansion of the existing footprint of the existing structure; or
b.
No additional encroachment into any setback shall be created by the proposed improvement, construction or addition.
(2)
When each of the following circumstances also exists:
a.
No encroachment or construction of habitable space or other prohibited improvements will exist below one foot above the base flood elevation; and
b.
The requested improvements or construction will not violate existing zoning provisions.
This subsection shall have specific application to existing nonconforming structures as referred to in section 3-020.
(F)
Compliance with ordinances. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code of Ordinances, no application for a variance may be accepted nor may any variance be granted with respect to any property that is then not in compliance with the requirements of ordinances for the condition on which the variance is sought, unless the applicant files with the application a detailed written explanation of how, when, and by whom the need for a variance was created. In such a case, the planning commission shall make a recommendation to the mayor and council as to whether the variance should be approved or rejected or modified and the mayor and council, following a public hearing, may approve, reject or modify the variance request. In the event property is constructed in violation of the ordinances, the violation status remains until such time as the condition is rectified and placed in conformity with the ordinances. Violations of the ordinances may be subject to the enforcement provisions of this Code and all penalties permissible by law. A variance that is granted under this section does not excuse prior violations including those that have resulted or may result in enforcement action by the city.

Sec. 5-111. - Conditional zoning.
In conjunction with the approval of a rezoning of property in accordance with this article, the city council may impose conditions to rezoning approval which shall have the full force and effect of law. A condition to rezoning approval may be imposed regardless of whether it is agreed to by the applicant or property owner.

Sec. 5-130. - Major subdivision plat procedure.
It shall be the duty of the planning commission to inspect preliminary plans and to recommend approval or disapproval of such plans. It shall be the duty of the planning commission to inspect final plats and the information submitted with such final plats, and to recommend approval of such final plats when the requirements of this article have been met and to recommend disapproval of such final plats when the requirements of this article have not been met. When the planning commission acts on a plat, it shall forward it to the mayor and council with its recommendations.
(A)
Action on preliminary plan. If the planning commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plan complies with the design requirements of these regulations, it shall recommend approval of such preliminary plan to the mayor and council.

Foundation survey. Any person erecting, moving, enlarging, or reconstructing any principal or any accessory structure by 250 square feet or greater, which, under this ordinance, requires a building permit shall upon completion of the construction of the footings, concrete slab, piers, or other foundations, submit to the community development department a letter from the architect or the owner's agent certifying that the required setbacks have been met along with a survey prepared by a Georgia registered land surveyor showing the locations, boundaries, dimensions, elevations, and sizes of the following: the boundaries of the lot, all existing structures including foundations and their relationship to the lot(s) lines. The designated city official shall compare the location of all new or extended footing, concrete slabs, piers, or other foundations with the location of all proposed construction activity reported on the building permit application. No further inspections such as electrical, plumbing, or HVAC may occur after the foundation inspection unless the designated city official shall find that the foundation location is consistent with the permit as issued. A determination that the foundation location is consistent with the building permit as issued shall not be construed as a warranty or guarantee that the as-built drawing will be approved [see Section 5-156(B)]. In all circumstances it is the responsibility of the owner, contractor or applicant to satisfy all setback requirements. A foundation survey is not required when an approved building plan shows all the setbacks to be double those required.
(B)
As-built drawing requirements. On a project which site plan approval, special review, engineering, a drainage plan, or plan review is required, the owner, contractor or applicant shall file an as-built plan certified by a State of Georgia certified engineer, surveyor or architect demonstrating compliance with the previously approved plans and identifying any deviations therefrom. If there are deviations identified, the engineer or architect must certify that the deviations will not materially adversely alter the stormwater controls or drainage characteristics of the original plan or that the deviations are within acceptable levels of tolerance recognized by the profession. Until such certified as-built plans are accepted by the city and approved, no certificates of occupancy may be issued.
(C)
Height certification. The city shall have the right to request that the contractor have a State of Georgia certified engineer or surveyor certify the height of any structure.
