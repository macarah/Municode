  These penalties where applicable are in lieu of fines or sentences that might be imposed pursuant to section 1-8, general penalty, and under section 10-31, penalties for violations of the ordinances of the city.
Citations for violations shall be issued by an authorized city designee as determined by the city manager and such individual need not be a post certified law enforcement officer. The citation, in a form similar to a parking citation, shall be delivered to the alleged violator with the amount of fine stated thereon. The suspected violator shall provide evidence of his or her name, address and date of birth to the designee, and upon the failure to do so, the city designee is entitled to contact a law enforcement officer for further investigation and/or citation as appropriate. Upon a refusal to identify oneself to the designee and/or a law enforcement officer, the officer may cite the individual with any applicable ordinance violation and may continue an investigation into the perpetrator's identity to ensure appropriate action is taken and that payment of the appropriate fine is made.
The citation shall provide for the civil penalty to be paid within ten days. The citation shall include a notice of violation of the particular ordinance or rule to which the citation applies and the basis for the violation and direct the recipient that within ten days of the time when such citation was served to pay the fine as specified on the citation in return for which that person shall receive a receipt, the form of which is designated by the list on file with the departments of the city and the clerk of the city, and the receipt as approved by the departments of the city.

The failure of the individual receiving a citation to make full payment within ten days shall result in the issuance of a civil penalty delinquency notice which shall demand payment plus a $20.00 payment by a specified payment due date. The failure of the individual to make said payment will result in issuance of an administrative hearing notice which shall demand:
(1)
Full payment of the civil penalty, the $20.00 delinquency penalty, plus $10.00 for each issued citation; or
(2)
The individual's appearance on a given date at a specified time and location for an administrative hearing before the department head.
(Ord. No. 2020-03 , § 1, 5-14-2020)

The failure of the individual to make full payment for all issued citations, or to have amounts due set aside at the administrative hearing will result in the individual being issued a subpoena to appear in court and possibly be subject to additional court fines and cost.
At anytime during a citation process, including any hearings related to a citation, the individual who is the subject of the citation may appeal the citation or penalty to the municipal court of the city by a written notice directed to the city designee and city manager as well as the clerk of the city municipal court for a hearing will be conducted before the judge who may then render such penalty as is appropriate in the discretion of the court, in the event of a conviction or discharge the individual or otherwise dispose of the matter as the judge deems appropriate.
