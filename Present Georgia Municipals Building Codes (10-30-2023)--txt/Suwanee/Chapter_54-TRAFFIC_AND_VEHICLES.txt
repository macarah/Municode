Sec. 54-49. - Contesting the civil penalty.
(a)
In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(D), liability shall be determined based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Prima-facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this ordinance was operated in violation of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a), together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such violation the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle:
(1)
Testifies under oath in open court that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation.
(2)
Presents to the court prior to the return date established on the citation a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation.
(3)
Submits to the court prior to the return date established on the citation a sworn notarized statement identifying the name of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation.
(4)
Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code as part of a funeral procession.
(5)
Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code in order to avoid impeding the efforts of an emergency vehicle to pass through the intersection.
(6)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the recorded image detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the alleged violation with at least two recorded images thereof. Within ten days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide proof to the city of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time and location of the violation and within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with at least two recorded images of the alleged violation. After receipt by the city of the proof of the name address of the driver of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible.
(b)
The provisions of this ordinance shall not limit law enforcement agencies to the use of traffic-control signal monitoring devices in enforcing O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a); and, when there is evidence obtained from another source or sources which constitutes a prima-facie case of a violation of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a), such violation may be prosecuted as otherwise provided by law in lieu of, but not in addition to, enforcement under this ordinance.
