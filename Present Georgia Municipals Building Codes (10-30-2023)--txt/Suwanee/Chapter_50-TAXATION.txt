(c)
If the amount paid for an occupational tax during the immediately preceding year, computed on the estimated gross receipts for the period, is more than the amount due as computed upon the final actual return, the overpayment difference shall be refundable to the business, or alternatively, if the business enterprise remains in existence, the overpayment may be credited towards the estimated occupational tax due for the current year.
(d)
Refunds of the occupational tax shall be permitted where there has occurred a clerical error in the submission of a return or application, or where there has been discovered a clerical error in business classification or tax computation, or where there has been a voluntary or involuntary overpayment of the tax.
