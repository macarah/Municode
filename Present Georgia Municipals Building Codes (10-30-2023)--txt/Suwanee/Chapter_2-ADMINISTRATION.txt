(Ord. of 12-18-2018(1) )
Sec. 2-182. - Methods of procurement.
The following methods of procurement shall be used for the purchase of goods and services:
(1)
Open procurement. This method is for small dollar purchases of standard operating supplies and services on an as-needed basis.
(2)
Quotes. This method is for single purchases and involves soliciting quotations from at least three vendors when practicable. These quotes can be obtained either by telephone, fax, e-mail, mail, or internet solicitations and are not normally advertised. Award is generally made to the lowest responsive and responsible vendor meeting specifications.
(3)
Formal bidding. This method is utilized when the cost of supplies, materials or equipment required on a single purchase exceeds $35,000.00. The process requires advertising in a newspaper of general circulation, receiving sealed bids, and generally awarding the purchase to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder meeting specifications. The city may utilize the reverse auction method of formal bidding over the internet, if practical.
(4)
Request for proposal (RFP). This method is used primarily for professional services and highly technical commodities. An RFP differs from a formal bid in that proposals may be solicited in a one or two-step process. The award may be granted to other than the lowest-priced vendor.
(5)
Design-build. In this method, design and construction of a project are included in a single contract. It allows the city to hire one firm to provide both professional design and construction services while reducing the administration costs typically involved with monitoring multiple contracts.
(Ord. of 12-18-2018(1) )
Sec. 2-183. - Prequalification.

(2)
Criteria for prequalification shall be available to any prospective bidder or offeror requesting such information.
(3)
There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders or offerors of the criteria for prequalification.
(4)
There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder or offeror to respond to his or her disqualification to the city manager; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal.
(c)
Where prequalification is required, no invitation to bid or RFP will be solicited until the prequalification process is complete.
(d)
No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the City of Suwanee from a prospective bidder who has not been prequalified on the procurement in question where the invitation for bids or request for proposals specified that prequalification would be mandatory.
(Ord. of 12-18-2018(1) )
Sec. 2-184. - Guidelines and source selection.
Within these guidelines, the department head has the responsibility and authority to control the funds budgeted for the operation of their department. The department head is expected to control expenditures to these budgeted amounts and effect savings where possible. It is the responsibility of the financial services department staff to assist departments with efforts toward this end.
(1)
State advertising requirements and regulations:
Compliance with O.C.G.A. 36-80-26 requires that if a formal bid opportunity is extended and it exceeds $10,000, this opportunity to bid is required to be posted on the Georgia Procurement Registry. (Suwanee's procurement policy requires formal bidding only when the purchase exceeds $35,000 or as otherwise required by law.)
If a bid or proposal opportunity is extended for public works construction contracts subject to O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 91, this opportunity is required to be posted on the Georgia Procurement Registry.
Each advertisement shall include such details and specifications as will enable the public to know the extent and character of the bid or proposal opportunity.
(http://doas.ga.gov/state-purchasing/georgia-procurement-registry-for-local-governments)
(2)
State contract items:
Items and services available under state contract do not require any additional bidding. If the department head chooses not to purchase an item that is available to the city under a state contract, he/she must document the state contract price and the reason for not selecting the contract vendor, in addition to following the guidelines below.
(Ord. of 12-18-2018(1) )
Sec. 2-185. - Purchasing levels.
The dollar limits for quotes and formal bids that will govern the proper method for the purchase of goods and services are as follows:
(1)
Tier 1—Purchases under $35,000.00. The department head may approve any purchase under $35,000.00, provided that the approved budget for the department contains sufficient funding in the appropriate line item and according to the following guidelines:
a.
Purchases under $5,000.00 (open procurement). Purchases in this category may be made without competitive price quotes via open procurement, based on the department head's knowledge of the market, responsibility for stewardship, and operational requirements. The department heads should maintain helpful resources regarding the market and pricing data and attach this information to the request for payment.
b.
Purchases between $5,000.00 and $20,000.00 (quotes). Purchases in this category require three competitive price quotes.
Telephone, fax, e-mail, mail or internet solicitations are acceptable, but all responses from vendors must be documented and maintained in the vendor file to be accompanied with the invoice for payment.
It is recognized that in certain highly specialized procurements, it may not be possible to obtain three price quotes. In those cases, the department head must document the facts and circumstances as a part of the audit trail to accompany the invoice for payment.
c.
Purchases between $20,000.00 and $35,000.00 (quotes). Purchases in this category require three written price quotes from responsible vendors.
Normally the lowest quote will be accepted; however price is not always the determining factor. When a department head selects other than the lowest quote, he or she must justify the decision to the city manager in writing before the purchase may be affected.
The city manager shall approve each purchase in this category in writing.
(2)
Tier 2—Purchases in excess of $35,000.00 (formal bidding).
a.
Purchases in this category must be decided by formal bidding or request for proposal (RFP) with exception to professional services as defined below (see section 2-186).
b.
The department head shall prepare either a RFP or an "invitation to bid" (which ever is appropriate) and forward such to prospective bidders. The time and place for submission of bids and other administrative requirements will be clearly stated. Bids shall generally be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder and any invitation to bid or RFP shall state that the city reserves the right to reject any and all bids or proposals.
c.
The city manager shall approve purchases under $50,000.00 in this category in writing.
d.
Purchases greater than $50,000.00, shall be approved by the city council.
(Ord. of 12-18-2018(1) )
Sec. 2-186. - Exceptions to competitive process.
(a)
Professional services. The bidding of a price quote for professional services is not required. Professional services include, but are not limited to, the city attorney, city auditor, architectural/engineering services, information technology systems management and other service providers designated by the city council. If the city desires to solicit bids or proposals for professional services, these services should be bid based on qualifications, performance and quality of work. Price may be considered but does not have to be a primary factor. The mayor and city council will approve all contracts for professional services above $50,000.00. Professional services contracts under $50,000.00 may be approved by the city manager.
(b)
Standard off-the-shelf equipment. Procurement awards for off-the-shelf equipment and/or standard commodities, where the dollar amount is less than $50,000.00 and approved in the adopted budget, do not require formal bidding if awarded to the lowest responsible, responsive offeror. Quote practices outlined in section 2-185(1)c should be followed.
(c)
State contract items. Items that may be purchased under state contract do not require any additional bidding.
(d)
Cooperative purchasing. The city may participate in a cooperative purchasing agreement for procurement with other governmental entities or non-governmental organizations for contracts, agreements or bids. Cooperative purchasing helps to reduce the cost of purchased goods and services through pooling the purchasing power of multiple agencies.
The city may also participate in "piggy-backing" onto existing procurements of other governmental entities or non-governmental organizations provided that the procuring entity purchasing policies are compatible with Suwanee's purchasing policies. These may include, but are not limited to, state contracts and bids, county contracts and bids, and local government contracts and bids.
(e)
Federal or other grant purchases. Periodically, the city may be given public or private grants and donations from sources such as the federal government, state government, private corporations, foundations, etc. These funding sources often include restrictive stipulations and may dictate the procurement process and methodology that the city is to follow for the contract award. Notwithstanding any other provision of the policy, the city may enter into any contract, follow any procedure, or take any action that is otherwise at variance with this policy if necessary or convenient to receiving funds from the government of the United States, State of Georgia, other governmental/public and private entities.
When using Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funds, competitive negotiation (as specified in 23 U.S.C. 112 (b)(2)(A) and 23 CFR 172.5(a)(1)) is based on qualification based selection procedures (as specified in 40 U.S.C. 1101-1104 (Brooks Act)) and shall be the primary method of procurement for engineering and design related services using Federal Aid Highway Program (FAHP) funding.
The city shall ensure that the purchase of equipment, supplies and/or services relating to the expenditures of federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds shall follow federal requirements in accordance with the "Common Rule, 24 CFR Part 85 to the CDBG Entitlement Program."
(f)
Emergency purchases. An emergency is hereby defined as any situation or circumstance that is determined to constitute a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property, or to the delivery of essential services, and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially in the short term with the passage of time.
The city manager may declare a "purchasing emergency situation" that would permit a waiver of normal competitive purchasing procedures during a bona fide emergency. However, the purchasing emergency situation shall expire within 96 hours of being declared. During this time, the city manager shall consult with the mayor and solicit formal guidance and direction on this declaration, consistent with the city Charter.
Emergency purchasing provisions shall not be used to compensate for poor planning.
(g)
Sole source or specified source purchases. A sole source situation exists when: there is a lack of responsible competition for a commodity or service which is vital to the operation and best interest of the city; a vendor possesses exclusive or predominant capabilities; a product or service is unique and easily established as one-of-a-kind; there is a patented feature providing a superior utility not obtainable from similar products; a proprietary right exists and the product is available from only one prime source; and/or the administrative costs to undertake a procurement of design process exceed the value of the product or service.
(h)
Contractual services. Ongoing services or agreements may be renewed or continued if the department head determines that it is in the best interest of the city. This decision should be based on satisfactory service, reasonable prices and the desire to avoid the interruption of city business; and/or based on good business sense if pursuant to the terms and conditions of the contract.
Contractual services are defined as, but not limited to, landscape services, paving contracts, janitorial services and building maintenance.
(i)
Change orders and contract modifications.
(1)
Original contract under $50,000.00. The city manager shall have the authority to approve all change orders and contracts up to $50,000.00 of the original contract plus all change orders, provided that the change order does not exceed the current project budget allocations. Should the original contract and change orders exceed $50,000.00, authorization by city council will be required.
ii.
Original contract over $50,000.00. The city manager shall have the authority to approve all change orders and contracts up to $50,000.00 above the original contract, provided that the change order does not exceed current project budget allocations. Should the change orders exceed $50,000.00, authorization by city council will be required.
