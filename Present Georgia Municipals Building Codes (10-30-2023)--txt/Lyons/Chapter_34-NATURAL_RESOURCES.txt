ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 34-1. - Drilling of water wells.
(a)
It shall be unlawful for anyone to drill or dig a water well, either deep or shallow, on any property within the city, provided the city has previously made available or will, upon written request, make available within a reasonable time thereafter an adequate water supply for the uses and purposes intended at the site where the supply of water is desired.
(b)
The drilling of wells in the city limits for the purpose of heating and air conditioning only is permitted, provided that the water must be returned directly to the ground and not used for any other purpose. The applicant must appear personally before the city council and must pay an inspection fee of $15.00 upon signing a contract with the city.
(c)
If a supply of water shall be desired at any site within the city which is not at that time furnished by the city water supply or which cannot, within a reasonable time, be provided by the city water supply, the city, acting by and through the city council, may, at its discretion, issue to the person desiring the water supply a license authorizing the drilling or digging of a water well, deep or shallow, the cost of such license to be set by the city council. However, no such license may be issued unless the application for such license shall be accompanied by a certificate from the proper city, county and state officials indicating that the water supply at the site of the contemplated well is safe for human and animal consumption and is in no way deleterious to the health, safety and welfare of any potential user or consumer of the supply of water or contiguous landowner or occupant.
(d)
It shall be the duty of the city officers to inspect property within the city to discover violations of this section upon the private or public property within the city.
(e)
This section shall be administered by the mayor, city council, police department, city engineer, building inspectors and other city law enforcement officers under the supervision of the city council. The owner or tenant in possession of any land or property shall be notified, in writing, of any violation within the city to abate such violation, nuisance and public health hazard by removing or closing such well within 15 days of receipt of the notice. The notice shall be served by registered mail, addressed to the owner or tenant at his last known address.
(f)
A person receiving a written notice of a violation may appeal to the city council within seven days of receipt of the notice, stating therein his reasons, in writing, which may be filed with the city clerk, as to why he is unable or should not be required to comply with this section or as to why this section is not applicable to him or to the situation in question, and these issues shall be heard and tried by the city council, which shall decide the questions in issue according to the evidence submitted by the parties.

DIVISION 2. - ON-SITE SEWAGE MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS

Sec. 34-76. - General provisions.
(a)
Permit required. No building, mobile home, structure, or land within the city shall hereafter be erected, constructed, located, moved, used, subdivided, altered or disturbed except in conformity with the regulations herein and without first obtaining a permit from the city. This provision does and shall apply to the location of all manufactured housing and industrialized buildings in the city.
(b)
Minimum lot size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the city shall be of such size as necessary to meet all requirements, rules, and regulations of the Georgia Department of Public Health according to the "Rules of Georgia Department of Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems" manual for on-site sewage management systems and as necessary to comply with the minimums set forth in the tables MT-1 and MT-2 hereby attached to and made a part of this article as Appendix I, if on-site sewage management is utilized, and/or with the county health department determination under the manual, whichever is stricter (i.e., requires the largest lot size).
(c)
On-site sewage management permit required. No person or business shall construct an on-site sewage management system on any lot within the city until a site approval letter or an on-site sewage management construction permit has been issued by and obtained from the county health department.
(d)
Permit coordination. The permit under section 34-76 (a) shall not be issued until the county health department issues an on-site site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this article.
(e)
Requirements are minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this article shall be the minimum requirements.
(f)
Compliance with state and federal laws, rules and regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the city shall also meet the requirements of all other applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations in effect, including but not limited to state and federal department of transportation regulations, state fire marshal regulations, uniform Construction Codes, Erosion and Sedimentation Acts, and all other Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Environmental Protection Division environmental rules and regulations.

DIVISION 3. - WETLANDS PROTECTION REGULATIONS

Sec. 34-101. - Findings of fact.
The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities.
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-102. - Reference map.
The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the city and to be regulated areas under this article will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Toombs County, Georgia. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps"), and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by the Corps.
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-103. - Wetlands development permit requirements.
No activity or use besides those identified in section 34-104 shall be allowed within wetlands without a wetlands use permit issued by the city, except as otherwise set forth herein. Activities or uses permitted under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act may receive a wetlands use permit issued by the city after the applicable federal permit or federal letter of permission/determination has been obtained, as described below, and once any other applicable provisions of this article are satisfied:
(1)
If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development, which is subject to permit herein, would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this article section is necessary.
(2)
If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development, which is subject to permit herein, may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the Corps jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this article.
(3)
If the Corps jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this article will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at his or her own expense, obtains either a Section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the Corps that no federal permit is required.
(4)
No action in the administration of this article and no wetlands use permit issued by the city shall relieve anyone from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance.
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-104. - Uses not requiring permit.
The following uses are permitted, without a wetlands use permit issued by the city, on wetlands within the city to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging, other than as allowed herein, and provided they have no long term impairment for wetland function.
(1)
Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities, though Section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption);
(2)
Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require a Section 404 permit;
(3)
Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, bird watching, hiking, biking, boating, horseback riding, kayaking, and canoeing;
(4)
Natural water quality treatment or purification; and
(5)
Normal agriculture activities, including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock (such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture).
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-105. - Prohibited uses.
In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them:
(1)

DIVISION 4. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS PROTECTION REGULATIONS

Sec. 34-136. - Findings of fact.
Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank affluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents of the city relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies.
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-137. - Reference map.
The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the city to be regulated areas under this article is the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition)."
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-138. - Groundwater recharge areas development permit requirements.
All uses, except those identified in section 34-139 and those subject to further restrictions by any underlying zoning district, are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses:
(1)
All new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of US EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1, et. seq. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal and state requirements;
(2)
All single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses, which are located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems, shall be required to have 150 percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DPH Manual) Tables MT-1 and MT-2 (included as part of this article in Appendix I), as determined by the county health department. The minimums set forth in Tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the public health manual. Said minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations or determination specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply;
(3)
All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located;
(4)
No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other on-site sewage management system unless the county health department first approves the proposed on-site sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for on-site sewage management systems and the applicable provisions of this article;
(5)
All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins; and
(6)
All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10" 7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, or the Environmental Protection Division.
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-139. - Prohibited uses.
The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them:
(1)
All new hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities;
(2)
New facilities handling hazardous materials regulated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources as to require a permit;
(3)
Permanent storm water infiltration basins; and
(4)
All new sanitary or other landfills.

DIVISION 5. - MAJOR RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION DISTRICT REGULATIONS

Sec. 34-171. - Findings of fact.
Perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to the State of Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb flood waters.
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-172. - District delineation.
Protected rivers as defined under the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-2-8, includes any perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Altamaha River and the Ohoopee River through Toombs County and meet this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective 100 foot natural vegetative buffer, as defined in Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division's Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria Chapter 391-3-16, is hereby established along the entire length of this river(s) within the jurisdiction of Toombs County. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank, if any, within the city. Under the method prescribed by the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a 100 foot buffer of the river bank except for certain permitted uses as set forth in section 34-173.
(Ord. No. 1308, § 1, 4-3-2018)
Sec. 34-173. - Permitted uses.
No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity shall occur within the 100 foot buffer from the protected river except for the following permitted uses, as long as they do not impair the long term functions of the protected river or the protected river corridor. In addition, the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction within the river corridor in connection with the following permitted uses:
(1)
Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the county health department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drain field is located outside of the 100 foot buffer area;
(2)
Any residential use existing or under construction prior to the date of the adoption of this article; provided that, such use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the county health department prior to the date of adoption of this article;
(3)
Any industrial or commercial use existing prior to the date of the adoption of this article; provided that, such use does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meets all other federal and state environmental rules and regulations;
(4)
Road and utility crossings, and utility locations if no other location is reasonable, providing the construction of these crossings and uses meet the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any other state or local requirements, if stricter, protect the integrity of the buffer area to the extent reasonably possible, and are located as far from the river bank as is reasonably possible;
(5)
Timber production and harvesting; provided that, it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended;
(6)
Agricultural production and management; provided that, it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission or its successor, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended;
(7)
Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, as amended;
(8)
Natural water quality treatment or purification;
(9)
Wastewater treatment; and
(10)
Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation.
