PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 66-114. - Purpose.
The purpose of a planned unit development is to encourage the development of large tracts of land to produce logically organized development with compatible land uses. Planning for an entire development encourages higher-quality growth rather than development conducted in incremental, uncoordinated stages. Planned unit developments allow for flexibility in the application of area, height, bulk, and other zoning regulations, preservation of open space and unique environmental features, development of harmonious design and architecture, creative arrangement and mixes of land uses and housing types in site planning, and more efficient road and utility network. It is anticipated that a pattern of innovative neighborhood development, inclusive of alternative residential designs and commercial land uses, will accommodate residents in all stages of life by providing them with a setting that is integrated with civic spaces, supportive services, and various amenities.
(Ord. of 12-4-2020(1) )
Sec. 66-115. - Type of PUD districts permitted.
(a)
Residential Planned Unit Development (R-PUD). This is a planned development concept that concentrates buildings in specific areas on a site to allow the remaining land to be used for recreation, common open space, limited agricultural uses, and the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas. A mix of residential dwelling unit types is also desirable in this concept to promote a balanced community. Innovative concepts such as zero lot lines, townhouse-condominiums, traditional neighborhoods, villages, cluster-type or conservation subdivisions are encouraged.
(b)
Commercial Planned Unit Development (C-PUD). This is a planned development concept that all more than one type of use in a building or set of buildings, including some combination of residential and selective nonresidential uses such as commercial, agricultural, office and institutional uses.

Sec. 66-116. - Utilization.
This district is to be utilized as a "floating zone" which shall mean that areas will not be pre-designated as planned unit development districts, but rather each such designation shall result from a specific and separate application for amendment to the zoning ordinance and map. Planned unit development districts are separate zoning districts and shall follow the approval procedures set forth in section 66-161. The development standards and the land uses which are presented in the PUD application for amendment to the zoning ordinance and map shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and shall become a part of the zoning regulations for the subject property. For purposes of zoning compliance, a PUD district property shall be treated as one (1) lot or parcel.
Previously approved developments of a nature substantially in accord with the intent of these regulations, may be rezoned to PUD status, and shall thereafter be subject to the regulations and requirements for such districts.
(Ord. of 12-4-2020(1) )
Sec. 66-117. - General requirements.
(a)
Single entity. A PUD is to be planned, developed, operated, and maintained as a single entity whether by a single owner or under unified control) containing one or more structures to accommodate residential, commercial and industrial uses, or an appropriate mix thereof, and appurtenant common areas and other uses incidental to the predominant uses.
(b)
Location. A PUD shall be located on roads with a minimum classification or status of major collector.
(c)
Common open space required. The following standards shall apply for open space in a PUD.
(1)
Within an R-PUD or C-PUD, no less than 20 percent of the gross residential area excluding rights-of-way, easements, paved areas must be set aside as common area open space. Each two square feet of existing or natural water surface, periodically flooded (based on the 100-year flood contour elevation), or inundated land may be credited as one square foot of land area for required open area. Half of allocated open space must be usable for active or passive recreation, which is accessible to all residents of the PUD and not include any part of a golf course.
(2)
Common open space must be used for amenity or recreation purposes and must be suitably improved for its intended use. Common open space containing natural features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. The buildings, structures, and improvements which are permitted in the common open space must be appropriate to the uses which are authorized for the common open space. Open space shall not be interpreted to include rights-of-ways, easements, paved areas, pending area of service areas.
(3)
The common open space shall be situated such that is will best serve the residents and be totally integrated within the various land uses of the planned unit development.
(4)
The common and open space areas and facilities shall be held in common by a legally constituted association of property owners with the financial capability to maintain the open space and shall be on a recorded plat as permanent common area open space for the use of residents, workers, patrons and visitors to the development.
(5)
Maintenance of common areas shall be one of the following:
a.
Maintained by the county if common areas are accepted by the county as a part of a final development agreement; or
b.
By a mandatory property owner's association which shall be responsible for ownership, operation, maintenance and insurance of all land and facilities within the common areas of the development.
(d)
Connectivity. Pathways for bicycles and pedestrians shall be incorporated throughout the planned unit development and along all perimeter streets to ensure connectivity between uses and with adjacent properties.
(e)
Compatibility and buffers. Land uses developed at the perimeter of the site shall be developed in a manner that is compatible with adjacent off-site land uses or zoning, or a 100-foot wide buffer shall be provided between the uses in the PUD and the perimeter of the site. Compatibility shall be judged on the basis of similar land uses, average lot sizes, setbacks, and other development standards.
