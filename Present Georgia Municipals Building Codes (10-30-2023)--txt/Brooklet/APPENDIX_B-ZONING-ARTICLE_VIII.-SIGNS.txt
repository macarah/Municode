ARTICLE VIII. - SIGNS[2]

Footnotes:
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. of 4-19-2012 repealed former Art. VIII, §§ 8-1—8-16, and enacted a new Art. VIII as set out herein. The former article pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 7-31-2003, §§ 8-1—8-15; Ord. of 3-18-2004.

Sec. 8-1. - Purposes.
The City Council of Brooklet has determined that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city that a comprehensive and balanced system of control and regulation be enacted as to the placement, maintenance and removal of signs within the limits of the city, said determination having been derived from, but not limited to the following concerns:
(1)
The safe and efficient flow of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic through the city which may otherwise be impeded by the indiscriminate proliferation of signage erected to attract the attention of the traveling public, and which if left unregulated, may result in hazards to travelers through the erection of increased numbers of larger, brighter or more distracting signs by owners attempting to convey competing messages;
(2)
The protection of property values, both public and private, by assuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses while balancing the community's variant interests of enhancing the commercial and economic atmosphere of the city with the desire to maintain a tranquil aesthetic environment that eliminates visual clutter and blight through the management of hardscape features, including signage;
(3)
The interference with the ability of property owners to enjoy or use their property without undue visual obstruction, distraction or hazard;
(4)
The preservation and protection of properties and areas having historic, recreational, educational, cultural, or religious values and environments, and prominent community gateways and major thoroughfares which, through orderly design and maintenance of the built environment—including signage—provide for community pride and exhibit clear community expectations that promote investment through a predictable development pattern;
(5)
The elimination of potential hazards arising during times of inclement weather or other natural disaster;
(6)
The provision of some signage that has the targeted purpose of promoting public safety but is difficult to describe without referring to its incidental function, such as address numerals or subdivision or major development entrance signage, which signage is a tool for enabling the traveling public and emergency personnel to locate point of ingress and egress during visitation or emergency call response. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners;
(7)
The control of the proliferation and placement of signs in an indiscriminate manner so as to pose a threat to the aesthetic and environmental values and qualities of life within city limits of Brooklet; and
(8)
Increasingly vibrant and distracting signs, including those incorporating LED and similar technology, cause unique and substantial hazards to traffic caused by a higher level of distractibility, are inconsistent with the standards established for major community thoroughfares and gateways, and demand greater diligence and resources in enforcing proper use and display than those signs not incorporating such technology.

Action. Within 15 business days of the submission of an application for a sign permit, including required and accompanying materials as provided in section 8-3(b) of this article, the zoning administrator shall either:
(1)
Issue the permit where it is found that such sign application is complete and the proposed sign adheres to the standards of this article and other applicable requirements of city ordinances and state law; or
(2)
Deny the permit where the application is incomplete, contains false material statements or where the proposed sign would violate standards of this article or other ordinances or state laws regulating signage. Any denial of a permit shall be in writing and shall include a specification of the section(s) of the ordinance, or applicable provision of other city ordinances or state laws with which the sign is inconsistent. The denial shall be based upon and shall cite to the specific articulated standards in this article, or other law, and shall not be based upon or cited to the general concerns contained in section 8-1 herein. A denied application later resubmitted in conformity with this article shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, rather than on the date of original submission. A decision to deny a permit shall be in writing and shall be served on the permit applicant either by hand delivery or by first class mail to the address provided by the applicant no later than 15 business days after initial receipt of the application.
(e)
Lapse of permit. If construction of a sign for which a permit has been issued has not begun within six months of the issuance of the permit, the permit shall lapse and become null and void. Thereafter, the applicant shall be required to obtain another permit prior to constructing or modifying the sign.
(f)
Inspections. Upon substantial completion of the construction or modification of a permanent sign for which a permit has been issued, the permittee shall notify the building official and request an inspection. If the construction is substantially complete, but not in full compliance with this article and other applicable codes, the zoning administrator or his designee shall give the owner or applicant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days from the date of such inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the permit shall lapse. If the permit lapses, the zoning administrator may require the owner or applicant to remove the sign or obtain another permit to correct the deficiencies.
(g)
Appeals. In the event of denial of an application for a permit, the applicant may appeal the decision in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XI, Appendix B—Zoning.
(h)
Work without permit issuance. If any person, owner, authorized agent or contractor commences any work before securing permits required by this article, fees upon application shall be doubled.
(i)
Revocation. In the event it is determined that a permit was issued in violation of this article or other ordinance or law regulating the sign at issue or where the sign has been erected in violation of such standards, the zoning administrator may issue the permit holder a written notice of revocation of the permit, stating the grounds for such revocation action. The zoning administrator's decision to revoke a permit may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XI, Appendix B—Zoning.
(j)
Multiple lots. If several lots of record which are contiguous and adjacent have been combined for a single purpose, then the lots shall be considered as a single lot in determining the size, height and use requirements as set forth by this article.

A current and valid sign permit shall be freely assignable to a successor as owner of the property or holder of a business license for the same premises, subject to any filing of such applications as the zoning administrator may require; no fees shall be charged for filing an assignment with the city. The assignment shall not require city approval. However, a modification of the sign by an assignee shall require a permit and payment of fee as for a new sign.

(d)
Dimensional standards by sign district. Signs may be erected in those districts where the applicable sign type is allowed as provided within the Tables 2, 3, and 4 contained in this section. The following principles shall control when computing the sign area, height and other miscellaneous provisions provided in Tables 2, 3, and 4:
(1)
Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face shall be calculated by means of the smallest shape (i.e., square, circle, rectangle) that surrounds the extreme limits of writing or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework.
(2)
Computation of area of multifaced signs. The area of a sign with more than one face shall be calculated by totaling the areas of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two faces are identical and back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time, the sign shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
(3)
Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be calculated as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign.
(4)
Computation of aggregate sign area for a lot. The aggregate sign area for a lot shall be computed by adding together the area of all permanent signs on the lot that require a permit, including portions of any signs that are changeable copy or electronic message centers.
