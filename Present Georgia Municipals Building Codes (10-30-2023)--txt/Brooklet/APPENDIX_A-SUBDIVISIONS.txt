APPENDIX A - SUBDIVISIONS[1]
Footnotes:
--- (1) ---
Editor's noteâ€” Printed herein is the city's subdivision ordinance, being an appendix to the zoning ordinance adopted on March 4, 2002. Amendments to the original ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended sections. The absence of a history note indicates that the section remains unchanged from the original zoning ordinance. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, and expression of numbers in text has been used to conform to the city Code. Material encased in brackets has been editorially supplied.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

Sec. 1. - General definitions.
Except as specifically defined herein, or as set forth in section 2 of this article, all words used in this chapter [ordinance] shall carry their customary dictionary meanings.
Sec. 2. - Additional definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter [ordinance] shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Cul-de-sac means a dead end street where there is room to turn at a circular end.
Master plan (same as a comprehensive plan) means any part or element of the overall plan for development adopted by the city council.
Street means, relates to, and includes a right-of-way affording primary access to abutting property including avenues, boulevards, roads, highways, expressways, lanes, alleys, and other public or private ways.
Subdivider means an individual, firm, association, syndicate, partnership, corporation, trust or any other legal entity (or agent therefor) that undertakes the activities covered by these regulations. Inasmuch as the subdivision plat is merely a necessary means to the end of assuring satisfactory development, the term "subdivider" is intended to include terms "developer" and "builder" even though the persons involved in successive stages of the project may vary.
Subdivision means a division of a tract or parcel of land (which existed at the time of the enactment of this zoning ordinance as one contiguous parcel for zoning purposes) into three or more lots, building sites, or divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of conveyance, transfer, improvement, sale, legacy or building development, and includes all division of land involving a new street (regardless of the number of lots) or a change in existing streets, and includes a resubdivision, provided however, that the following are not included within this definition: The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards set forth in this chapter [ordinance].
Sec. 3. - Purpose.
This chapter [ordinance] is enacted to encourage the development of an economically sound and stable community; to assure the provision of required streets, utilities, and other facilities and services to new land developments; to assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in new land developments; to the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, education, and other public purposes; to assure, in general the development of areas in harmony with the master plan of the community; and to secure equitable handling of all subdivision plans by providing uniform procedures and standards for observance both by the subdivider and the planning commission.
Sec. 4. - Four-step review.
The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a subdivision plat consists of four separate steps. These are:
A.
Review of sketch plans by the building inspector and zoning administrator;
B.
Consideration and approval of sketch plans by the planning commission;
C.
Review of preliminary plats by the building inspector and zoning administrator with subsequent approvals by the planning commission and city council; and
D.
Review of final plat by the building inspector and zoning administrator.
Steps A, B and C shall be completed prior to making any street improvement or installing any utilities. Step D shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision.
Sec. 5. - Conflict with other laws.
When the provisions of this chapter [ordinance] specify more restrictive standards than required by any other statute, the requirements of this chapter [ordinance] shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other statute require more restrictive standards, the provisions of such statute shall govern.
ARTICLE II. - SKETCH PLANS

Sec. 1. - Sketch plan review procedures.
At least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the planning commission, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning administrator 12 copies of a sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. If phase development is contemplated, then a sketch plan for each phase will be required simultaneously. Included with the sketch plan must be a sketch map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat and to enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. Utilizing the comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance, the building inspector, zoning administrator and the planning commission shall review and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan within 45 days from the meeting at which it is considered. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission meeting. Failure of the subdivider to submit a preliminary plat within 18 months from the approval of the sketch plan will require resubmittal of the sketch plan to the planning commission for reconsideration.
Sec. 2. - Sketch plan.
Scale. The sketch plan shall be drawn at a scale of not less than 100 feet to one inch.
Vicinity map. The sketch plan shall include a vicinity map at a scale not less than one inch equals one mile showing the relationship of the proposed subdivision to surrounding development.

modified
The subdivider shall be required to install or have installed, at its own expense, the following improvements:
(1)
Monuments: Two concrete monuments at least 36 inches in length and four inches square with a suitable center point at each street intersection on the right-of-way line, and iron pin monuments less than three-fourths inch in diameter and 24 inches long at all points on boundary lines of lots where there is a change in direction, and at all lot corners.
(2)
Streets: At least two inches of Georgia DOT specification hot plant mix asphalt on a base of at least six inches of stabilized gravel or eight inches of crushed limestone, or equivalent. No final grading or paving of the street, or construction or installation of utilities in the bed of a street shall be permitted until the grade has been officially established. No paving shall begin until underground utilities are installed and approved and the compacted base has been inspected and approved by the city engineer, which shall be a licensed professional engineer selected by the city.
(3)
Water mains: Where a public water main is within 1,500 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point, the subdivider shall at its sole expense connect with such water main. In all cases, where feasible, water systems shall be looped. In such cases, mains of at least six inches shall be required. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs of all tap-ons and extensions to existing municipal facilities. The water systems connected to the public water main shall be approved by the official representative of the city prior to final plat approval, which official may be a licensed professional engineer selected by the city. Provided, however, as a temporary incentive to subdividers who have begun the subdivision process by submitting a sketch plan to the zoning administrator in accordance with Brooklet's subdivision ordinance (appendix "A" of the Brooklet Code) on or before September 30, 2022, but excluding any subdivider who has had a final plat approved under said subdivision ordinance, that enters into a contract with the city contractually agreeing to construct the streets within said subdivision without an inverted crown design, and to install curb and gutter along said streets, the city shall pay the costs of materials only for the extension of Brooklet's water system from an existing Brooklet public water main within 1,500 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point, to include the portion of the water system within the subdivision, which will ultimately become part of the city's water system (but not including any part that will be on an individual customer's property), to the extent that such project is reasonably economically feasible, considering the costs involved, potential revenues to the city, and monies available to fund such project. Where such criteria are met, the contract may provide that the city shall in fact pay for such materials.
(4)
Sanitary sewer: Wherever a public sanitary sewer is within 1,500 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point and connection by gravity flow is feasible, the subdivider shall connect with such sanitary sewer and provide connection for each lot. The size of the mains shall be at least eight inches. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs of all taps, life [lift] pump stations, manholes, and extensions to existing municipal facilities. Where sanitary sewers are not available, an oxidation pond, septic tank, or other disposal device designed and installed according to standards of the appropriate governmental agency may be permitted.
(5)
Storm sewers: Storm sewers, catch basins, and culverts shall be provided in each subdivision, and shall be constructed of concrete. They shall be designed to carry not less than the storm water from a rainfall expected to occur once in ten years, with a runoff factor of 90 percent for pavements and buildings and a variable runoff factor depending on the topography of the ground for other areas. Storm drainage design shall be based upon Talbot's Formula. All storm sewage calculations shall be verified by a licensed professional engineer employed by the subdivider.
(6)
Curbs and gutters: Upon review, the planning commission may or may not require that curb and gutters be installed. If required, valley gutters may be permitted on grades over six percent.
(7)
Easements: Except where alleys are permitted for the purpose, the developer shall provide easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines for utilities; such easements shall be at least 20 feet wide.
(8)
Sidewalks: Pedestrian sidewalks of at least four feet in width. Pedestrian easements shall also be provided to grant access to recreation areas and/or school sites when, in the opinion of the planning commission, sufficient access is not provided by proposed streets. All sidewalks are to be a minimum of four feet in width, four inches in thickness of 2,500 p.s.i. concrete, with three-foot wide handicap ramps at intersections.
(9)
Street signs: There shall be placed at least one standard reflectorized street name sign at every intersection, and two diagonally opposed when deemed necessary by the planning commission.
(10)
Utility installation: Public utility installation costs for gas, telephone, electrical, cable television, and street lights shall be borne by the developer or utility company. Installation shall be on street rights-of-way, specified easements, or under streets prior to paving of streets. All utilities shall be underground.
(11)
Fire hydrants: One fire hydrant within 500 feet of each residence or other structure measured over streets, and at any other location designated by the city water department.
(12)
Variances or other improvements: Where the subdivider can show that a provision of these regulations would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, and where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, in opinion of the planning commission a departure may be made without destroying the intent of such provisions, the planning commission may authorize a variance. Likewise, because of particular conditions or circumstances relative to a particular subdivision, the planning commission may require the installation of sidewalks, streets, trees or other improvements not specifically set forth herein. Any variance thus authorized or additional improvements thus required are to be stated in writing in the minutes of the planning commission with the reasoning on which the variance or addition was justified set forth.
(13)
Street light requirement: Subdivider shall install street lights for the benefit of the subdivision in a manner sufficient to light the streets. Subdivider shall maintain the street lighting system. The subdivider shall submit/obtain the design approval of a licensed professional engineer as to the appropriate configuration of the lighting system. Provided, however, as a temporary incentive to subdividers, for any subdivision for which the final plat is approved by the planning commission of the City of Brooklet between the date of this ordinance and the earlier of June 30, 2024, or the repeal of this section, the subdivider shall not be required to maintain the street lighting system after the date on which the streets within said subdivision are accepted into the City of Brooklet as per the terms of the city's subdivision ordinance, article VII, section 5 of Appendix Aâ€”Subdivisions, and the city shall be responsible for maintaining said street lights along the streets accepted by the city as city streets. Provided further, if all of the streets within the applicable subdivision are not accepted by the city as city streets, this incentive shall apply only to that portion of the street lighting system located on the streets actually accepted by the city as city streets.
(14)
Curb and gutter: Concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed in accordance with approved plans and specifications by the city. Approval of the subdivider's plans by the city engineer is required. Curbs and gutters shall be designed to provide a ramp for bicycles and/or wheelchairs as required by state law and according to the ADA requirements. The standard curb and gutter shall be a minimum of 18 inches wide. Roll-over curb and gutter is permitted. Curbs and gutters shall have a minimum gutter thickness of six inches. All concrete used for curbs and gutters shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Georgia Department of Transportation State of Georgia Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and bridges. Curbs and gutters shall be constructed with Portland cement concrete having a compressive strength of equal or greater to 3,000 p.s.i. Curbs and gutters shall be constructed of Class B concrete. Asphalt curbs and gutters will not be acceptable within publicly maintained right-of-way. Curbs and gutters shall be constructed prior to the construction of the pavement.
