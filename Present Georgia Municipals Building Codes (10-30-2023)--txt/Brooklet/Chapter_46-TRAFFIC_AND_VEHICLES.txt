Secs. 46-8—46-19. - Reserved.
ARTICLE II. - PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES

Sec. 46-20. - Short title.
This article shall be known as the "Brooklet Personal Transportation Vehicle Ordinance."
(Ord. No. 2017-2, 8-17-2017)
Sec. 46-21. - Findings and intent.
The ordinance from which this article is derived is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Personal transportation vehicles (PTVs) and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of PTVs on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in PTVs on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of PTV on roads, sidewalks, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates a PTV or other similar vehicle is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any state law or this article as a condition of operating PTVs and other similar vehicles on the roads of the city.
(Ord. No. 2017-2, 8-17-2017)
Sec. 46-22. - Definitions.
The definitions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 40-1-1, as it may be amended from time to time, are adopted and incorporated by reference herein. The current definition of personal transportation vehicle (sometimes referred to herein as "PTV") set forth in O.C.G.A. § 40-1-1 is, in relevant part, as follows: "Any motor vehicle: (i) with a minimum of four wheels; (ii) capable of a maximum level ground speed of less than 20 mph; (iii) with a maximum gross vehicle unladen or empty weight of 1,375 pounds; and (iv) capable of transporting not more than eight persons.
(Ord. No. 2017-2, 8-17-2017)
Sec. 46-23. - Registration.
(a)
A fee of $15.00 shall be paid to the city to register each and every PTV by the owner for use of such PTV on the public streets and roads within the city, which fee shall be charged by the city to cover the costs of implementing and maintaining this article. It shall be the duty of every owner of a PTV that is operated on public streets, roads, right-of-way or other public property in the jurisdiction of the city to register the PTV with the city clerk prior to operating the PTV on any public street, road, right-of-way or other public property within the city.
(b)
Registration with the city shall include a record of the model, make, any vehicle identification number or serial number on such PTV, the name and address of the owner, a contact phone number, and any other such information as the city shall require, all of which shall be maintained by the city clerk.
(c)
Upon registration with the city, each PTV shall be issued a registration decal from the city signifying such registration. The decals must be affixed in the vicinity of the left rear taillight in such a manner as to be visible at all times and shall remain permanently with such PTV unless the PTV is sold or the registration decal is destroyed. A PTV registration is valid for two years.
(d)

(e)
The registration decal issued by the city shall be non-transferrable from the PTV for which it was obtained.
(f)
Upon transfer of the PTV to the ownership of another person, the PTV must be re-registered with the city within ten business days of the change in ownership. Such re-registration fee shall be in an amount of $15.00. If the registration is not transferred within ten business days it shall be considered an unregistered PTV and subject the owner of such PTV to penalties set forth in section 1-8.
(g)
PTV dealers and distributors, along with other commercial establishments may rent PTVs to the public for use on designated public streets, roads, rights-of-way or other public property. Each such establishment renting PTVs shall be required to maintain a written record of each person who rents each PTV. Renters shall be required to furnish positive identification, shall be provided a copy of this article to read, and must be at least 18 years of age. The registration fee, along with all licensing and operation regulations, shall be the same as those which apply to other PTVs under this article. Each dealer or other commercial establishment obtaining registration decals for rental PTVs must provide a copy of liability insurance at the time such dealer or commercial establishment obtains the registration decals.
(h)
Only those persons 18 years of age and older may register a PTV. PTV registration may be in one person's name only, and the registration form must be signed by that person.
(i)
Any owner registering a PTV with the city agrees to abide by all of the requirements of state law and this Code. By registering a PTV with the city, the owner verifies that the vehicle qualifies to be classified as such under state law and this Code.
(j)
The city council may, at its discretion, and by resolution, waive registration requirements for special events of a limited duration to which out-of-city residents may bring PTVs as participants. Such special events shall last no longer than seven calendar days.
