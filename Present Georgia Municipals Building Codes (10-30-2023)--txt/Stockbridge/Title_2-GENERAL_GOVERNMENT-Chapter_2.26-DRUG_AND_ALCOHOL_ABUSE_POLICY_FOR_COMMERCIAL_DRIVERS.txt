Chapter 2.26 - DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE POLICY FOR COMMERCIAL DRIVERS

2.26.010 - Purpose.
To provide a drug and alcohol abuse policy that will assist in creating a safe driving environment and meet the requirements of the guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Transportation. This policy is intended to meet all regulatory requirements and, to the extent that any part of this policy is in conflict with the regulations found at 29 CFR Part 40 or Part 382, the terms of those regulations control.
(Ord. 96-2 § 1, 1996)
2.26.020 - General policy.
A.
The city recognizes that drug and alcohol abuse by employees could seriously endanger its employees and the public and detrimentally affect work performance. Therefore, current use of, or performing job duties while under the influence of, unlawfully used controlled substances or alcohol is strictly prohibited. A positive result on a drug or alcohol test conducted pursuant to this policy shall indicate current drug or alcohol use for the purposes of this policy. A refusal to take a drug test required by this policy may be deemed a positive result.
B.
An employee either reporting to work visibly impaired or observed to be visibly impaired while on duty will be deemed unable to perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, unlawful use or unlawful possession of hallucinogenic drugs, narcotics, or other controlled substances (or paraphernalia related to the abuse of such substances) is prohibited during working hours or at any time on city property.
C.
Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, use or possession of alcoholic beverages is prohibited during working hours or at any time on city property.
D.
Additionally, no employee may operate a commercial motor vehicle while in possession of an unlawful controlled substance or alcohol, unless that alcohol or unlawful controlled substance is manifested and transported as a shipment. No employee may use alcohol or an unlawful controlled substance while driving or otherwise performing a safety-sensitive job function. No employee may operate a commercial motor vehicle or perform any other safety-sensitive task within four (4) hours of using alcohol, even if the alcohol was used during off-duty time and off of city property.
E.
If an employee has an accident while operating a commercial motor vehicle, the employee may not use alcohol for eight (8) hours after the accident or until the employee undergoes an alcohol test administered under this policy, whichever comes first.
(Ord. 96-2 § 2, 1996)
2.26.030 - Designated representative for information.
Any questions about this policy or its application to a specific situation should be directed to the city manager or his designee.
(Ord. 96-2 § 3, 1996)
2.26.040 - Procedure.
A.
Employees and Applicants Covered by this Policy.
1.
In order to be covered by this policy, an employee must operate a commercial motor vehicle meeting certain weight or cargo standards. As to weight, a covered vehicle is: (1) a tractor trailer or similar vehicle with a gross combination weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more (inclusive of a towed unit with a gross vehicle weight rating of at least ten thousand (10,000) pounds) or (2) a single vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more. As to cargo, a covered vehicle is one of any weight which (1) is designed to transport sixteen (16) or more, including the driver, or (2) transports hazardous materials (as defined in 49 CFR Part 172, subpart F).
2.
Employees holding a commercial driver's license and employed in a position whose duties include operating any of the vehicles described above, or applicants for such positions, are covered by this policy. Covered employees and applicants (hereinafter referred to as "drivers") are subject to alcohol and drug testing as discussed below.
B.
Situations in Which Drug and Alcohol Testing Will Occur. Generally, drivers are not subject to alcohol or drug testing except in conjunction with certain on-duty job functions, i.e., just before, just after, or during the performance of "safety-sensitive" job duties as defined in 49 CFR § 395.2. Such duties include, but are not limited to: (1) time spent at the driving controls of a covered vehicle, (2) on-duty time waiting to be dispatched, (3) time spent inspecting, servicing, repairing or conditioning a covered vehicle, (4) nondriving time spent on or attending a covered vehicle (except time spent resting in a sleeper berth), or (5) time spent loading or unloading, (or supervising or assisting the loading or unloading) of a covered vehicle. Such "safety-sensitive" duties are hereinafter referred to in this policy simply as driving duties. A driver must submit to an alcohol and/or drug test when indicated by this policy. Particular circumstances which will trigger a drug or alcohol test in conjunction with driving duties are as follows:
1.
Testing on Reasonable Cause. A driver shall submit to a drug or alcohol test whenever the city has reasonable cause to believe that the driver is using a prohibited drug (as identified in subsection F of this section) or alcohol. The city's decision to test a driver for reasonable cause shall be based on the actions, appearance, speech, body odors or conduct of an on-duty driver which indicate the possible use of a prohibited drug or alcohol. The actions, appearance, speech, body odors or conduct of the driver indicating possible drug or alcohol use must be witnessed by at least one supervisor who has received DOT-approved training in the detection of probable drug or alcohol use. The supervisor(s) who witness conditions warranting a drug test shall prepare and sign a statement describing the driver's conduct within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the test are released, whichever is earlier. Third-party reports that an employee is impaired in his or her driving duties due to the use of prohibited drugs or alcohol shall not constitute reasonable cause, but may be cause for the observation of the employee by his or her supervisor(s). The city will provide transportation to the testing site for employees who will be tested for reasonable cause. If an alcohol test cannot be performed within two (2) hours following a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not administered. If an alcohol test is not performed within eight (8) hours of a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the test shall not be performed and the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not performed.
2.
Pre-Employment and Pre-Transfer Testing. In no case will a driver be allowed to assume first-time driving duties before the driver is tested for drugs. All applicants whom the city intends to hire for a driver position and all current employees whom the city intends to transfer into a driver position shall submit to a drug test as a prequalification condition. Such applicants and current employees shall be notified before a urine specimen is collected for testing that the specimen will be screened for evidence of drug use. A failure to pass the drug test or a refusal to submit to the drug test will result in the city's refusal to hire the applicant or transfer the employee. In certain instances, no pre-employment or pre-transfer drug test will be required of a driver who has participated in a DOT-qualified drug testing program within the previous thirty (30) days if either of the following is also true: (a) the driver passed a drug test administered within the six (6) months prior to the driver's application date, or (b) the driver was subject to random testing for the twelve (12) months prior to the driver's application date. If a pre-employment or pre-transfer test is not performed pursuant to this provision, the procedures set forth in 49 CFR § 382.301(d) will be followed prior to the performance of any driving duties.
3.
Post-Accident Testing. A driver who is involved in an accident involving loss of human life or who receives a citation for a moving traffic violation in connection with the accident shall submit to a drug and alcohol test as soon as possible after the accident. No drug test will be administered later than thirty-two (32) hours after the accident. No alcohol test will be administered later than eight (8) hours after the accident. Whenever a test cannot be administered within these time limits, the driver's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not timely administered. Whenever an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours after the accident, the employee's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. A driver who is unable to submit to testing at the time of the accident because of serious injuries received in the accident shall provide to the city the necessary authorization for obtaining hospital reports or other documents that would indicate the presence of any controlled substances or alcohol in the driver's system.
4.
Random Testing. Drivers shall be subject to random selection process whereby drivers will be selected and requested to be tested for use of controlled substances and alcohol. The selection method shall be scientifically valid and give each driver an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. Under this program at least fifty percent (50%) of the city's drivers will be subject to drug testing each calendar year, and at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the city's drivers will be subject to alcohol testing each calendar year.
5.
Return-to-Duty and Follow-up Testing. A driver who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns alcohol may not resume driving duties without first passing an alcohol test. A driver who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns controlled substances may not resume driving duties without first passing a controlled substances test. A driver who has completed drug rehabilitation or a recommended course of treatment for alcohol abuse under this policy shall, on resumption of driving duties, be subject to unannounced testing. Such testing shall be conducted over a period of twelve (12) to sixty (60) months and shall include at least six (6) unannounced tests during the first twelve (12) months of his/her return to duty. The type, frequency and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of the city's substance abuse professional, who may terminate the testing at any point after the first six (6) tests under this provision. Each such unannounced alcohol test shall be administered either just before the driver is to perform driving duties or just after the driver has finished performing driving duties.
C.
General Fitness for Duty Requirements.
1.
These general fitness for duty procedures are designed to apply even in situations in which no reasonable cause drug or alcohol test can be administered under this policy.
2.
An employee either reporting to work visibly impaired or observed to be visibly impaired while on duty will be deemed unable to perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's impaired status. If, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, the employee is impaired, the employee may be sent home or to a medical facility by a safe means of transportation (after any reasonable cause drug or alcohol testing required by other parts of this policy). The employee may be accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. Under no circumstances will an apparently impaired employee be allowed to drive a car or other vehicle.
3.
If a drug or alcohol test cannot be administered under this policy, the apparently impaired driver shall nonetheless remain ineligible to perform any driving duties for at least twenty-four (24) hours.
4.
If an employee, during work, must use prescribed drugs that have the potential to impair work performance or physical or mental abilities or if an employee will be under the influence of such prescribed drugs during work, the employee must report these facts to management and present appropriate medical documentation. A decision will then be made as to whether the employee should be able to perform his/her job safely and properly.
D.
Discipline for Violations of the Policy.
1.
Employees will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for any violation of this policy.
2.
Additionally, employees found to have violated any part of this policy shall be immediately disqualified from further driving duties, including any situation in which a driver refuses to submit to a required drug or alcohol test or fails to pass a drug or alcohol test. A driver who does not remain readily available for testing following a covered accident may be deemed by the city to have refused to take a drug or alcohol test. Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test includes: (a) the failure to provide an adequate breath or urine specimen absent a valid medical justification; (b) the intentional refusal to submit to the testing procedure; or (c) the engaging in any conduct that clearly obstructs the testing process. Drivers currently holding a position subject to drug testing who become disqualified from employment because of a refusal to submit to a required drug test or a failure to pass a required drug test shall be subject to discipline up to and including discharge.
3.
A driver who has refused to submit to a required drug test or failed to pass a drug test shall be eligible to resume driving only after the driver completes an approved drug rehabilitation program. A driver who has refused to submit to a required alcohol test or failed to pass an alcohol test shall be eligible to resume driving duties only after the driver completes any course of treatment recommended by the city's designated substance abuse professional.
E.
Condition of Employment. Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant or employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or any procedure under this policy or by signing any consent form or other documents required by the testing laboratory shall be grounds for refusal to hire or termination.
F.
Drug Testing Procedure. The laboratory performing drug testing for the city under the terms of this policy shall be certified by the Department of Health and Human Services under the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR Part 40. The mayor shall designate the laboratory for performing drug tests pursuant to this policy. Drug testing of covered employees shall conform to the following procedures:
1.
Drug tests shall be performed on urine specimens collected in accordance with procedures and standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR §§ 40.23 and 40.25.
2.
All analysis of drug tests performed pursuant to this policy shall meet the standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR § 40.29. Urine specimens shall be tested only for evidence of use of the following prohibited drugs: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP).
3.
Urine specimens shall be collected at a designated collection site by a "collection station person" (CSP). A collection site will be any suitable location at which a specimen of urine can be collected under the required conditions for privacy, security and temporary storage of the specimens. The collection site will have at least an enclosure for private urination, a toilet, some surface for writing, and a source of water for washing hands which, if practical, will be located outside of the privacy enclosure. The collection site under this policy shall be designated by the mayor.
4.
During specimen collection, the CSP will restrict access to the collection site. If the CSP is not a medical professional or if the driver has less than complete privacy, the CSP shall be of the same gender as the driver. Once the driver has completed giving the specimen, no person other than the CSP shall be permitted to handle the specimen until it is secured for transport. The CSP shall not observe the collection of urine except when there is reason to believe that the driver may alter or substitute the specimen. If the CSP has reason to believe the driver has tampered with a sample, another sample shall be drawn under same gender observation. The CSP will use a standardized custody and control form to ensure that the chain-of-custody is maintained over a sample from the time it is received from the driver to the time of the analysis of contents to the ultimate return of results to the medical review officer. The CSP will also use a tamperproof seal system that prevents undetected opening of the specimen bottle and that identifies the sample with a number also appearing on the custody and control form. The CSP will also use a tamperproof shipping container which may be sealed and which allows the paperwork to be attached.
5.
Each urine specimen collected will be subdivided into two (2) bottles labeled as a "primary" and a "split" specimen. Only the primary specimen will be opened and used for urinalysis. The split specimen bottle will remain sealed and will be stored at the laboratory. If analysis of the primary specimen confirms the presence of an illegal, controlled substance, the driver will have seventy-two (72) hours from the time of notification by the medical review officer to request that the split specimen be sent to another certified laboratory for a second analysis. A request for analysis of the split specimen will not stay any city actions or procedures otherwise required by this policy.
6.
Urine samples shall be analyzed using both a screen test and a confirmatory test. If the screen test result is negative, the laboratory will report the result of the test as negative. If a positive result for one or more controlled substances is obtained through a screening test, then a confirmatory test shall be performed for each identified drug. Only if the confirmatory test result is again positive will the laboratory report a positive result to the medical review officer.
7.
The refusal of an applicant or employee to submit to a drug test or the failure to pass a drug test required by this policy shall be cause for the refusal to hire an applicant into a driver position and shall be cause for disqualification from all driving duties, as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.
G.
Drug Reporting Procedures. The medical review officer (MRO), to be designated by the mayor, shall receive, review, report and file drug test information transmitted by the testing laboratory. The MRO is a licensed physician who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and who has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate drug test results.
1.
The testing laboratory shall report test results only to the designated MRO. Test results shall not be transmitted verbally by telephone to the MRO. The testing laboratory and the MRO shall ensure the confidentiality of the transmitted information and shall limit access to any data transmission, storage and retrieval system to ensure the security of the data transmission.
2.
The MRO shall review drug test results in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR § 40.33 and by the Federal Highway Administration in 49 CFR § 391.97.
3.
If the MRO determines that there is no legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed, positive drug-test result other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, the MRO shall notify management of his/her conclusions for further proceedings in accordance with this policy.
H.
Alcohol Testing Procedures. Alcohol tests shall be conducted using a breathalyzer approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). A "Breath Alcohol Technician" (BAT) who is trained in DOT testing procedures shall administer all alcohol breath tests under this policy.
1.
The breath test shall be conducted in a place that offers visual and aural privacy to the driver. All necessary equipment shall be provided at the testing location, which shall be secured from unauthorized entry.
2.
Prior to the test, the BAT will require the driver to provide positive identification. The BAT will explain the testing procedure to the driver before administering any test.
3.
A breath test shall consist of a screening test and a confirmatory test. The screening test will be conducted by first opening an individually sealed mouthpiece in view of the driver and attaching it to the testing device. The BAT will then instruct the employee to blow into the mouthpiece for a minimum of six (6) seconds or until the device indicates that an adequate amount of breath has been obtained. The driver must then be shown the result shown on the device and the result recorded. If the screen test reveals a blood alcohol level below .02, no further testing is required and the test result is considered negative. If, however, the screen test result is .02 or greater, the BAT must perform a confirmatory test.
4.
The BAT shall not conduct a confirmatory test until the expiration of a waiting period of not less than fifteen (15) minutes nor more than twenty (20) minutes from the initial test. A new mouthpiece shall be used. The confirmatory test shall be conducted using a testing device that prints out or otherwise provides a hard copy of the test results, the date and time, a sequential test number, and the name and serial number of the testing device. Whenever the results of the screen test and confirmatory test are not identical, the confirmatory test shall be deemed the final test result. A blood alcohol level of .04 or greater on the final test shall constitute a positive alcohol test result.
5.
The refusal of an employee to submit to an alcohol test or the failure to pass an alcohol test required by this policy shall be cause for disqualification from all driving duties, as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Drivers who have a blood alcohol level of .02 or greater but less than .04 when tested just before, during or just after performing any driving duties, are ineligible to return to duty for at least twenty-four (24) hours or until another breath test is administered for which the result is less than .02.
6.
Employees who violate this policy as to alcohol will be referred to a substance abuse professional for evaluation. The employee shall comply with any recommended treatment as a precondition to resuming driving duties.
7.
The collection site under this policy shall be designated by the mayor.

B.
In addition, the city shall provide training for supervisory personnel who will determine whether a covered employee must be tested for alcohol or drug use based on reasonable cause shall include two sixty (60) minute periods of training on the specific, contemporaneous physical, behavioral and performance indicators of probable drug and alcohol use. Additional supervisory training may cover the effects and consequences of drug use on personal health, safety and the work environment.

Furthermore, each driver employee who engages in any conduct prohibited by this policy shall be evaluated by the city's substance abuse professional, who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and controlled substances use.
B.
No aspect of this policy shall require the city to provide an employee assistance program (EAP) for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy and for supervisory personnel. From time to time, the city may provide an EAP for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy. The availability of, and eligibility for, benefits under any such EAP shall be governed by the terms of the EAP; however, entry into, or participation in, any EAP shall not excuse an employee from this policy's testing provisions or requirements for removal from duty.
(Ord. 96-2 § 7, 1996)
2.26.080 - Responsibility.
A.
