A.
The decibel level of any noise regulated by this chapter may be measured by the use of a sound level meter which measures sound pressure levels. Such measurements shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the level of noise at issue in any court or legal proceeding to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
B.
The sound level meter must be certified, and the calibrator must be recalibrated at least once each year by the manufacturer or by a person that has been approved by the noise control administrator (NCA). A copy of written documentation of such recertification and recalibration, in a form approved by the NCA, shall be kept with the equipment to which it refers.
C.
The accuracy of the sound level meter shall be tested by a calibrator recommended by the sound level meter manufacturer before and after each series of readings. Any sworn report of the results of any test of the calibrator for the accuracy of a sound level meter shall be admissible in court in any criminal or civil proceeding, as evidence of the facts therein stated.
D.
An individual operating a sound level meter pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall complete a sworn report to indicate:
1.
That the sound level meter used to take the decibel level reading was operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications;
2.
That the city has on file a certificate which states that the sound level meter has been tested within the past twelve (12) months and has been found to be accurate;
3.
