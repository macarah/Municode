Chapter 9.03 - SOUND PRODUCTION PERMITS

9.03.010 - Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this ordinance is to prescribe a method by which the city can regulate sound produced at subject establishments to prevent disturbances of the public peace in nearby residential areas. Although the city zoning ordinance allows and encourages many for-profit or not-for-profit businesses, offices, organizations or institutions to conduct their operations near residential areas and the city wishes to continue to permit such uses proximate to residential areas, some of these uses have generated sound at levels beyond those tolerable to the average residents of the city. These disturbances have generated numerous complaints and forced the city to bring legal actions against offensive businesses. Therefore, it is the city's intent to regulate the time, place and manner of sound produced at or by subject establishments as defined herein through the issuance and enforcement of sound production permits. Said permits are intended to protect the public safety and welfare as well as nearby residential property values from the adverse impacts of intolerable sound emanating from subject establishments.

"Measurement marker" is a marker on the property of a subject establishment indicating the location most directly in line with the most proximate residence, residential area or hospital at which the on-site tester measured the sound emanating from a sound source of an ASPD. A measurement marker must be made in such a way as to be readily identifiable by enforcement personnel for a period of at least one year.
"Off-site tester" is a tester who assists with determination of whether an establishment qualifies as a subject establishment or establishment of maximum permitted sound levels by measuring audible sound emanating from subject establishments while standing at a location designated by this chapter.
"On-site tester" is a tester who assists with determination of whether an establishment qualifies as a subject establishment or establishment of maximum permitted sound levels by adjusting and measuring the sound levels of sound production devices at establishments or ASPDs at subject establishments as required by this chapter.
"Sound measuring device" means the CESVA model SC-30 integrating sound level meter with real time frequency analyzer.
"Sound producing device" is any device, system or instrument, electrically powered or not, including but not limited to musical instruments, stereos, karaoke machines, jukeboxes, speakers, disc-jockey arrangements, live entertainment and the like, used by an establishment or located on the property of an establishment and, when operated, played, or performed, produces sound at a level greater than fifty decibel (50db) on an A-weighted scale or the designated hertz levels.
"Sound source" means any part of a sound producing device or ASPD from which sound can be made to emanates at a level greater than fifty decibel (50 db) on an A-weighted scale or any designated hertz level when measured within twenty feet (20') of said part.
"Subject establishment" means any establishment that operates or allows to be operated an ASPD and is thus subject to the permitting requirements of this chapter.
"Sound production permit" is a permit issued under this chapter for the purpose of regulating sound emanating from subject establishments.
"Tester" is a city approved, individual, company or partnership of good repute located in the state of Georgia who or which specializes in acoustical testing and is employed by the applicant or by the city to assists with a sound production test required by this chapter.

(Ord. 03-71 § 1 (part), 2003)
9.03.050 - Sound production test.
A.
The maximum permitted sound levels shall be established using the following sound production test.
1.
For this test, the on-site tester shall cause to be used music that produces sound that will register on both an A-weighted scale and at each designated hertz level (i.e., both treble and base sound). Also, during this test, doors and windows of the subject establishment shall be closed.
2.
Initially, each sound producing device of an establishment must be tested to determine whether it qualifies as an ASPD. To make such a determination, an on-site tester will cause said device to be operated, played, or performed at its highest sound producing level. If the sound produced by said device is detected above fifty decibels (50 db) on an A-weighted scale or above any of the designated hertz levels by an off-site tester using a sound measurement device at a distance of one hundred feet (100′) from the sound source, if outside, or from the exterior of the building or structure in which a sound source is located, then it shall be deemed an amplified sound production device.
3.
For each ASPD, an off-site tester shall stand outside of the nearest residence or hospital within ten feet (10′) of the exterior side which most directly faces the subject establishment while an on-site tester causes the volume of each ASPD to be increased to the point where the sound emanating from the ASPD is detectable at levels above fifty decibels (50 db) on the A-weighted scale and each of the designated hertz levels by the off-site tester.
4.
At that level of volume, the on-site tester causes the volume of the ASPD to be decreased to a level where the sound is no longer detected above fifty decibels (50 db) on an A-weighted scale or any of the designated hertz levels by the off-site tester. At that level using a sound measuring device, the on-site tester shall take and record a measurement of the A-weighted scale and each designated hertz level while standing as directly in line with the off-site tester's location as is reasonably possible and twenty feet (20′) from the exterior side of the building from which the sound is emanating. If an approximate in-line location is twenty feet (20′) from the exterior side of the building is not possible and easily accessible for enforcement purposes, then the on-site tester shall record a measurement at some other location easily identifiable for enforcement purposes and as close as possible to the above prescribed location. For the said location, the tester shall cause a measurement marker to be created and a description of and map indicating the location of the measurement marker shall be provided in the application for a sound production permit.
5.
Thereafter, the on-site tester shall take and record the same types of measurements twenty feet (20′) from each of the exterior sides of the building from which the sound is emanating.
6.
Each measurement shall be taken for a period of one minute and during the absence of background noise.
7.
A general description of each ASPD, the time, date and location of each recorded measurement along with the name and signature of the recorder shall be recorded and said record shall be attached to the affidavit described in subsection (A)(9) of this section.
8.
Of all the measurements taken and recorded for each ASPD on the premises of the subject establishment, the lowest of the A-weighted scale measurements and the lowest measurement for each designated hertz level shall be the maximum permitted sound levels for the subject establishment when measured at the measurement marker.
9.
The off-site and on-site testers shall execute an affidavit stating their company or partnership name; individual names, initials, titles, if any, and contact information; the maximum permitted sound level determined; the serial number, maker, name and type of sound measurement device used; a statement that the sound measurement devise was properly calibrated immediately prior to conducting this test and the time and date of said calibration; and a statement certifying that the recorded measurements are accurate and the same as those detected when the testers conducted the sound production test.
B.
The maximum permitted sound levels shall then be included in the application for a sound production permit and the permit itself.
C.
The sound measurement device shall be provided by the city and shall be used, properly calibrated and maintained by the city in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. A tester using a city owned sound measurement device shall not in anyway alter or tamper with the device. Doing so will be a violation of this chapter and grounds for revocation of any permit issued based on a sound production test using an altered or tampered device.
D.
Except where provided in this subsection or in subsection E of this section, applicants shall bear the cost of conducting a sound production tests and use testers as defined herein. As an alternative, applicants may allow the city to use its own testers provided applicants commit in writing to cover the costs incurred by the city to conduct sound production tests.
E.
If the city or its designee's determines, through its own sound production test, that the results of the sound production test preformed on behalf of the establishment or subject establishment is erroneous or inaccurate, the city council may take those actions permitted under subsection E of Section 9.03.040 provided it complies with the procedures set forth therein. Moreover, if the test reveals that the test results were inaccurate or erroneous, the applicant shall be liable to the city for the costs of such tests.
