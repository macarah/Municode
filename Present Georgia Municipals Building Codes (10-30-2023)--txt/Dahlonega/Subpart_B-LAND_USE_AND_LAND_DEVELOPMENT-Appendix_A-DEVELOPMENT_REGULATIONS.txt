ARTICLE V. - LOT AND BLOCK STANDARDS

Sec. 5.1. - Lots.
In general, lots should be designed such that they are no more than four times as deep as they are wide at the building setback line. For lots which include 1) particular or unusual difficulties to meet minimum setback limits, 2) unusual building sites due to easement configuration, 3) possible floodplain encroachment, 4) stormwater detention facilities, 5) zoning imposed buffers, and/or 6) unusual or severe topographic features, the City shall require a final plat notation requiring an approved Site Plan prior to issuance of a building permit. All lots shall conform to the requirements of the City of Dahlonega Zoning Ordinance. Minimum lot sizes, widths, and setbacks are specified in the City of Dahlonega Zoning Ordinance.
Sec. 5.2. - Side lot lines.
In so far as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must front for at least fifty (50) feet on a dedicated public street unless the lot upon which the building permit is requested is an approved lot in an approved Planned Unit Development.
Sec. 5.3. - Corner lots.
Corner lots shall have extra width to permit prescribed setback limits from all streets on which the lot has frontage.
Sec. 5.4. - Double frontage lots.
Double frontage lots other than corner lots shall be required for residential subdivisions along arterial or primary collector streets where internal access can be provided. When approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, double frontage lots can be used to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation and/or property size. Otherwise, double frontage lots other than corner lots shall be prohibited.
To properly separate residential subdivisions employing double frontage lots from traffic arteries, the Planning and Zoning Commission will require a planted buffer of ten-foot minimum width along the lot line abutting the traffic artery. The easement for the buffer will be required to deny right of access to the lot on which it is located.
Sec. 5.5. - Panhandle or flag lots.
Panhandle or Flag lots, of required width and area, may be allowed where terrain makes standard design or frontage impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access shall not be less than 20 feet wide, and the panhandle access shall not be more than 200 feet long. Not more than two (2) such panhandle access points shall abut each other, and if so combined the width of each panhandle may be reduced to not less than fifteen (15) feet. All such access points or combinations thereof shall be separated from each other by the frontage of a standard lot required under the applicable provisions of these Regulations.
Sec. 5.6. - Blocks.
The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to:
(a).
Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
(b).
Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions.
(c).
Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
(d).
Limitations and opportunities of topography.
The Planning and Zoning Commission may, when existing or proposed pedestrian/bicycle circulation patterns or public gathering places so justify, require pedestrian/bicycle ways or access easements through blocks.

ARTICLE VII. - STREET IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS

Sec. 7.1. - Street improvements.
Streets, whether abutting or internal, existing or new, shall be constructed or improved under those circumstances and to the standards as established in these Regulations. Roadway improvements shall be in accordance with the street classification system defined in these Regulations. Specific street classification designations shall be as shown in adopted transportation plans of the City or as established by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Sec. 7.2. - Minimum right-of-way and pavement widths.
The minimum widths for rights-of-way and pavements shall be as specified in these Regulations and shown on standard drawings.
On any existing street having a right-of-way less than the minimum which abuts a property being developed, Â½ of the required width of right-of-way, measured to the centerline of the existing right-of-way, shall be dedicated at no cost to the City along the entire property boundary abutting the existing street.
Additional street right-of-way width may be required to be dedicated at intersections or other locations fronting the property where turning lanes, storage lanes, medians, islands, or realignments are required for traffic safety and minimum right-of-way standards would be inadequate to accommodate these improvements.
Sec. 7.3. - Street widening.
When property fronting on an existing City street is to be developed and when the property is to be accessed from the existing City street, roadway improvements (pavement, curb and gutter and drainage) are required along the existing road across the entire property frontage. Required improvements shall not be less than provided in these Regulations for the designated street classification.
Road widening, curb, gutter, and drainage shall be provided from the centerline of the existing roadway along the side of the road upon which the property abuts. In lieu of installation of curbs and gutters and/or related improvements, the developer must have presented to and received approval by the City for a Street Improvements and Storm Water Drainage Plan for the development and its affected environs. Said plan must provide for adequate storm water drainage and will further address, as a minimum, street grading, paving, curbs and gutters, and or other innovative provisions for said drainage. This plan must conform to the applicable standards and specifications established by the City and be prepared, signed, and sealed by a Georgia registered professional civil engineer.
The developer shall be responsible for the relocation and/or modifications of public and/or private utilities as necessitated by the required street improvements.
Sec. 7.4. - New streets.
All public streets proposed to be constructed in a subdivision or other development shall be designed and constructed at least to the standards contained in these Regulations in accordance with the appropriate street classification of said streets.
Sec. 7.5. - Substandard streets.
In the event that a development has access to a substandard street and if that substandard street provides the primary means of access to the development, the substandard street, except as indicated below, shall be fully upgraded along the entire property frontage and continuing to the nearest standard paved road along the route of primary access.
In the event that a development has access to a substandard street and if that substandard street is other than the primary means of access to the development, the substandard street, except as indicated below, shall be fully upgraded only along the entire property frontage and shall be paved on the opposite side of the road from the development, 12 feet from the street centerline.
The upgrading of substandard streets used for access will not be required if any of the following conditions are met:
(a)
The development consists of a single one- or two-family residence on an existing recorded lot within the City;
(b)
Total traffic on the substandard street is less than 2,000 vehicles per day including projected traffic volume from the development; or
(c)
The development is a small business with ingress/egress of less than 100 vehicles per day.
Sec. 7.6. - Acceleration/deceleration lanes.
Except as indicated, acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be provided for new street and driveway connections to existing streets. The lanes will not be required if any of the following conditions are met:
(a)
The driveway is for a one- or two-family residence;
(b)
Total traffic on the existing roadway is less than 2,000 vehicles per day (count of existing traffic must have been made within one year of the development plan submittal date);
(c)
The driveway is for a small business with ingress/egress of less than 100 vehicles per day; or
(d)
Construction cost of the lanes exceeds 25 percent of the estimated development cost.
Sec. 7.7. - Improvements along state and federal highways.
For any development which abuts a State or Federal highway, improvements to the highway and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the highway shall comply with the standards and requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation. A copy of the approved Georgia DOT permit shall be provided to the City prior to issuance of building permits.

Employ, at Contractor's expense, an independent testing laboratory to perform quality control testing during trenching and backfilling operations.
The City may perform sampling, surveying, inspection or testing activity during construction for its use, but such activity does not relieve the Contractor from responsibility to achieve specified results.
SUBMITTALS:
Quality Control Testing Reports: After completing utility earthwork construction and prior to acceptance by the City, the Contractor must file a copy of the quality control test results demonstrating compliance with these specifications with the City. At any time during the construction process, representatives of the City may request to review and the Contractor shall provide quality control test results.
SITE INFORMATION:
Verify existing site grades to be substantially consistent with grades shown on the drawings before commencing work. Report any significant conflict in grades to the design engineer before proceeding.
Subsurface conditions presented, if any, are not intended as representations or warrants of continuity of such conditions between soil borings or pits. It is expressly understood that the Contractor is solely responsible for interpretations or conclusions drawn therefrom. Data are made available for the convenience of the Contractor who may, without cost to the City, perform additional test borings and other exploratory operations, provided such operations are acceptable to the City.
Existing Utilities: Locate all existing underground utilities in the areas of work including verification of nature and exact location of any utility indicated on drawings. If utilities are to remain in place, provide adequate means of protection during earthwork operations.
Should unexpected piping or other utilities be encountered during excavation, consult the utility owner immediately for directions. Cooperate with City and other utility companies in keeping respective services and facilities in operation. Repair damaged utilities to satisfaction of utility owner.
Do not interrupt utilities serving existing facilities except when permitted in writing by City and then only within time periods acceptable to the City.

Provide stone free of rounded, or worn surfaces and also free of segregation, seams, cracks, pyrite intrusions and other defects tending to reduce weather resistance.
PART 3 - EXECUTION
PROTECTION OF PERSONS AND PROPERTY:
Prior to commencing other work, accurately locate above and below ground utilities and structures which may be affected by the Work, using whatever means be appropriate. Mark the location of existing utilities and structures, not otherwise readily visible, with flagging, stakes, barricades, or other suitable means.
Barricade open excavations and post warning lights for safety of persons. Operate warning lights during hours from dusk to dawn each day.
Protect structures, utilities, sidewalks, pavements, and other facilities immediately adjacent to excavations, from damage caused by settlement, lateral movement, undermining, washout and other hazards.
Take precautions and provide necessary bracing and shoring to guard against movement or settlement of existing improvements or new construction. Contractor is entirely responsible for strength and adequacy of bracing and shoring, and for safety and support of construction from damage or injury caused by the lack thereof or by movement or settlement.
Use work methods and provide temporary facilities as necessary to prevent washing, erosion, siltation or dust damage, or hazard to persons and property, within and outside the work area.
Place excavated material compactly alongside of the trench, and keep such material trimmed up so as to present the least practicable inconvenience to the public. Where necessitated by traffic conditions, remove from the roadway the first material excavated from a working length of trench so that further excavation is immediately used for backfilling, and thereby avoid stockpiling of material upon the roadway. Afterward, return first excavated material if needed for final backfilling.
Maintain all streets, alleys, sidewalks, pipe crossings, fire hydrants, water and gas valves, and other utilities accessible for their intended use except while the work is steadily advancing in the immediate vicinity of each such facility.
Keep every drain, gutter, culvert, sewer, and surface drainage route encountered, open for both temporary and permanent flow unless other effective provision for drainage is made.
Do not permit any hazardous condition to result from trenching and backfilling operations.
USE OF EXPLOSIVES:
Do not bring explosives onto site or use in work without prior written permission from authorities having jurisdiction.
Use explosives only as legally permitted and when other work methods are impractical.
Do not permit explosives on the project site other than during the least practicable use period.
Assume sole responsibility for handling, storage, and use of any explosive materials.
TRENCHING:
Trenching consists of removal and disposal of material encountered to obtain required subgrade elevations, usually, but not necessarily limited to that incidental to installation or modification of underground pipelines and appurtenances.
Unauthorized trenching consists of removal of materials beyond indicated subgrade elevations or dimensions without specific authorization of the City.
Rock excavation consists of removal and disposal of natural material encountered that cannot be excavated without continuous and systematic drilling and blasting or continuous use of a ripper or other special equipment. Intermittent drilling or blasting performed to increase production and unnecessary for excavation of material encountered will not be classified as rock excavation.
Stability of Excavation: Slope sides of excavations to comply with Subpart P of Part 1926 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act as amended. Shore and brace or use trench box where sloping is not possible either because of space restrictions or stability of material excavated.
Maintain sides and slopes of excavations in a safe condition until completion of backfilling.
Shoring and Bracing: Provide portable trench boxes and materials for shoring and bracing, such as sheet piling, uprights, stringers and cross-braces, in good serviceable condition.
Maintain shoring and bracing and/or portable trench boxes in excavations regardless of time period excavations will be open. Carry down shoring and bracing as excavation progresses.
Provide trench boxes and/or shoring and bracing to comply with Subpart P of Part 1926 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act as amended.
Dewatering: Perform earthwork in a manner to prevent surface water and minimize subsurface or ground water from flowing into excavations, and to prevent water from flooding project work and surrounding area.
Do not allow water to accumulate in excavations. Remove water using dewatering methods which will prevent softening of foundation bottoms, undercutting footings, and soil changes detrimental to stability of subgrades and foundations. Provide and maintain pumps, sumps, suction and discharge lines, and other dewatering system components necessary to convey water away from excavations.
Limit opening of additional trench length to that which can be dewatered with available equipment or methods.
Do not use trench as temporary drainage ditch.
Material Storage: Locate and retain materials away from edge of trench.
Dispose of excess soil material and waste materials, such as unsatisfactory excavated soil material, trash and debris, as specified hereinafter.
Excavating: Do not extend excavation below or wider than that which is necessary to construct work except as otherwise provided herein. Repair any unauthorized trenching as necessary to obtain an adequate subgrade.
Limit open trench excavation to a maximum of 300 feet ahead of completed backfill.
Where specific utility system elevations or depths are indicated on the Drawings or elsewhere herein, accurately conform with such requirements. Otherwise, achieve a minimum earth and/or pavement cover of 30 inches above top of underground utilities being constructed unless a greater cover is made necessary by easement or permit requirement, by maintaining a minimum clearance of 18 inches below any existing or proposed structure or channel, or by achieving proper alignment with existing or proposed facilities.
Maintain a horizontal separation of at least 10 feet between sanitary sewers and any existing or proposed water main. A sewer may be laid closer than 10 feet to a water main if it is laid in a separate trench.
Maintain a vertical separation of at least 18 inches between the crown of sanitary sewers and the invert of existing or proposed water mains with the sewer located below the water main. Where a vertical separation of 18 inches cannot be provided and the water main cannot be relocated to provide adequate clearance, center one full length of water main over the sewer so that both joints of the water main will be as far from the sewer as possible.
Confine trench width from an elevation of one foot above top of underground pipe to the trench bottom, to that minimum which is necessary to pipe laying operations, but do not exceed maximum trench width determined by pipe foundation requirements.
Remove rock, masonry and concrete material to a distance of at least six inches from all parts of pipe and appurtenances being installed. Backfill and thoroughly compact to proper trench bottom elevation with select excavated material.
Do not mix excavated rock, masonry or concrete with backfill material placed within two feet of installed pipe, or within one foot of finished grade.
Pavement Removal: Remove all pavement, including curb and gutter, sidewalk and the like, which must be disturbed by trenching operations.
Saw cut edges of bituminous pavement. For concrete pavement, saw cut edges or remove and replace to nearest joint.
At sidewalks, curbs and gutters, and the like, remove entire width of damaged sections.
Extend pavement removal to the width required to accomplish trenching operations without damage to edge of remaining pavement. Correct any edge damage which occurs as requested by the City.
Removal of Unsatisfactory Soil Materials: To the extent necessary, over-excavate those soil materials which are unsatisfactory in the opinion of the City and backfill with approved materials.
COMPACTION:
General: Control soil compaction during construction providing minimum percentage of density specified for each area classification.
Percentage of Maximum Density Requirements: Achieve not less than the following percentages of maximum density of soil material compacted at optimum moisture content, for each layer of soil material-in-place as determined by ASTM D 698 (Standard Proctor) test procedures:
Rights-of-Way: Conform with the more stringent requirements of the permit issuing authority and the requirements herein.
Roadways: Under and within five feet horizontal distance of traffic using surfaces, compact each layer of backfill and fill material to 95 percent of maximum dry density.
Walkways: Under and within two feet horizontal distance of paved walks, compact top six inches of subgrade and each layer of backfill and fill material to 95 percent of maximum dry density.
Driveways and Parking Lots: Under and within two feet horizontal distance of traffic-using surfaces, compact each layer of backfill and fill material to 95 percent of maximum dry density.
Lawn or Unpaved Areas: Compact each layer of backfill or fill material to 85 percent of maximum dry density.
Spoil Areas: Compact each layer of backfill or fill material to 85 percent of maximum dry density.
Moisture Control: Where a layer of soil material is too dry to achieve required compaction, uniformly apply water to layer as necessary to bring moisture within limits which permit compaction to at least the specified densities.
Remove, dry and replace, or scarify and air dry in place, soil material that is too wet to achieve required compaction.
BACKFILL AND FILL:
General: Place acceptable soil material in uniform layers, to required elevations. Backfill excavations as promptly as work permits.
Backfill and Fill Materials: Use acceptable trench excavated soil material, free of stumps, trees, roots, muck, trash and other objectionable matter.
Placement and Compaction: Place backfill and fill materials in layers not more than eight inches in loose depth. Before compaction, moisten or aerate each layer as necessary to provide the proper moisture content. Compact each layer to not less than the required percentage of maximum density for each area classification. Do not place backfill or fill material on surfaces that are muddy, frozen, or contain frost or ice.
Commence backfill and fill operations close behind utility laying operations. Take care to prevent wedging action of backfill or fill against structures by carrying the material uniformly around structure to approximately same elevation in each lift.
GRADING:
General: Uniformly grade areas within limits of earthwork, including adjacent transition areas. Smooth and compact finished surface within specified tolerances, with uniform levels or slopes between points where elevations are shown, or between such points and existing grades, or between existing grades.
Grading Outside Structures: Grade finished areas adjacent to structures to drain away from structures (except drainage inlets), and to prevent ponding. Finish surfaces free from irregular surface changes, and as follows:
Grassed or Landscaped Areas: Finish areas to within not more than 0.10 feet above or below the required elevations.
Walks and Pavements: Shape surface of areas under walks and pavements to line, grade and cross-section, with finish surface not more than Â½ inch above or below the required subgrade elevation.
Compaction: After grading, compact subgrade surfaces to the depth and percentage of maximum density for each area classification.
RIP RAP SURFACE STABILIZATION:
General:
Prior to placing rip rap, bring ground surface to correct line and grades. At Contractor's option, provide either soil cement bag rip rap or stone rip rap at all stream crossings, and/or at locations indicated on Drawings or requested by the City.
Soil Cement Bag Rip Rap:
Proportion select pipe line excavation material and cement in the ratio of 5:1 by volume. Uniformly fill bags to maximum capacity which will permit satisfactory tying, and which produces an in-place thickness of 6 inches. Place bagged rip rap by hand with the tied joint ends facing the same direction with close staggered joints.
When rip rap is placed above water level, do not add water to mix until bags have been finally placed. Then lightly sprinkle bags with water using methods which moisten soil-cement through its entire depth without causing washes or permitting bagged material to become fluid. Use minimum water necessary to moisten mix.
When rip rap is placed below water, temporarily place bagged mix above water level and moisten as outlined above. Use care in uniformly shaping bagged mixture to approximately rectangular cross section before adding water. After moistened bagged mixture has set up sufficiently to be handled without cracking, but not less than 7 days, the rip rap may be placed in its final position. Where bagged mix can be placed below water without danger of contents being washed out of bags, bags may be placed under water in the same manner as specified for placing above water.
When placing rip rap above water level, ram and pack bags against one another to produce the required thickness and form a consolidated mass. When placing rip rap below water, carefully handle bags so as not to crack the soil-cement. Place bags neatly and so that finished rip rap units are free of tendency to slip out of position. Place all rip rap so that no more than 3 inches variation exists above or below the required plane.
Stone Rip Rap:
Hand place stone rip rap into final position to form a compact layer not less than 6 inches in-place thickness. Use well graded stone sizes to eliminate void spaces between stones.
Place stones neatly and anchor units to be free of tendency to slip out of position. Place rip rap so that no more than 3 inches variation exists above or below the required plane.
MAINTENANCE:
Protection of Graded Areas: Protect newly graded areas from traffic and erosion, and keep free of trash and debris.
Repair and re-establish grades in settled, eroded, and rutted areas to specified compaction and tolerances.
Reconditioning Compacted Areas: Where completed compacted areas are disturbed by subsequent construction, adverse weather, traffic, or other cause, scarify surface, re-shape, and compact to required density prior to further construction.
Maintain temporary erosion and sediment control measures until permanent measures become effective.
DISPOSAL OF EXCESS AND WASTE MATERIALS:
Disposal of Excess Excavation: Transport excess excavated material, including unsatisfactory soil material, to any designated spoil areas, and spread as specified; otherwise remove from the project work area and legally dispose of such material which cannot be acceptably distributed within project work area.
Disposal of Waste Material: Remove trash, debris, and waste materials from the project work area and legally dispose of such material.
RESTORATION:
Plan and execute total work so as to minimize damage to property. Restore all surface materials, shrubbery, fences, lawns, walls, structures and other improvements to a condition no less desirable than that which existed before construction operations began.
Conduct all construction operations such that upon completion of any part of the work, the contour and topography of the construction area has not been substantially altered. No alteration of previously established storm drainage patterns will be permitted unless such alteration can be proven to the City's satisfaction to improve the drainage pattern without adverse impact on affected property owners.
Where necessary to temporarily remove or damage improvements of any significance, take professional quality photographs of such improvements before disturbing them. Make copies of such photographs available to the City on request.
Restore work area and accomplish site cleanup immediately after backfilling and fill operations.

INSPECTION:
Examine areas and conditions under which tunneling is to be done, and notify design engineer in writing, of conditions detrimental to proper and timely completion of Work.
GENERAL:
Carry out Work in a safe manner, taking all necessary precautions and measures necessary to maintain a stable construction system which does not weaken existing earth or structures nor cause settlement of the overpassing roadway or railway section.
When tunneling operations are carried out under railroad tracks, highways, streets, or any other existing thoroughfare, perform operations in such manner as not to interfere with nor in any way endanger the normal operation of such thoroughfares.
Complete all tunneling work at one particular location before starting work at another location.
EXCAVATION:
The following requirements are supplemental to Section 02204, Trenching and Backfilling, of these specifications.
When required, excavate suitable pits or trenches for tunneling operations. Provide all necessary bracing, sheeting and/or other temporary means to ensure safety of persons and property. Comply with Subpart P of Part 1926 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act as amended.
Maintain excavation free from water, mud and debris which will interfere with an efficient tunneling operation. Neatly dry-excavate material of whatever nature encountered within the tunnel. Do not use sluicing or jetting excavation techniques.
Limit excavation to the minimum diameter required for tunnel liner installation.
Pressure grout all excessive voids which may develop about the tunnel liner exterior.
Promptly backfill all pits and trenches.
JACKING:
When installing tunnel liner by jacking method, use guide rails or other jacking frame structure to effectively maintain tunnel liner at proper line and grade. Force tunnel liner into place with suitable jacks which apply uniform pressure around the tunnel liner end section. Excavate at the lead end of the tunnel as the jacking operation progresses, but do not excavate more than six inches in front of tunnel liner. Reduce the two feet distance where material character results in excess loss of soil. Remove excavated material through the tunnel liner. Once jacking is begun, continue operation without interruption to prevent the pipe from becoming firmly set in the embankment.
Perform tunneling such that the final tunnel liner position is within the following limits:
Lateral Alignment: Within two percent of tunnel liner length.
Vertical Elevation: Within one percent of tunnel liner vertical grade, provided that the final grade of flow line is in the direction indicated on the Drawings.
BORING:
Mechanically bore by use of a cutting head on a continuous auger. Install tunnel liner in hole by jacking or other suitable methods. Accomplish boring of hole and tunnel liner installation simultaneously. Do not permit boring to proceed more than one foot in front of tunnel liner.
At contractor's option and to minimize abandoned tunnel liner, conduct initial boring using a pilot hole approximately 2 inches in diameter for the entire installation length. Verify required line and grade and use pilot hole as the center line of the larger hole to be bored. If rock is encountered in pilot hole, withdraw equipment and relocate tunnel location. Conduct pilot hole installation in revised location and repeat procedure. No extra payment will be considered for installations that encounter rock and must be abandoned.
Perform tunneling such that the final tunnel liner position is within the following limits:
Lateral Alignment: Within two percent of tunnel liner length.
Vertical Elevation: Within one percent of tunnel liner vertical grade, provided that the final grade of flow line is in the direction indicated on the Drawings.
MINING:
When installing tunnel liner by mining methods, handle, maintain, and install liner plate sections in such manner as to avoid damage to plates and surface coating thereon. Install liner plates immediately after excavated material is removed from the tunnel. Do not permit liner plate installation to fall more than 24 inches behind the tunnel working face. Do not leave more than 12 inches of unlined tunnel at the end of the day's operation.
Provide all necessary bracing bulkheads and/or shields required to ensure safety of persons and property. Provide well braced, temporary bulkhead against excavation face during each cessation of work while the heading is within 20 feet of railroad tracks or roadway pavement.
Pressure grout voids between excavated tunnel bore and liner plate at least daily as tunnel excavation and liner plate installation proceeds. In addition, do not extend liner plate installation more than 10 feet without placing grout. Introduce grout through all grout holes in tunnel liner plate at or near tunnel invert, continue grouting until grout mixture bleeds through grout holes located at tunnel crown. Use grouting pressure sufficient to fill all voids.
Perform tunneling such that the final tunnel liner position is within 0.2 feet of specified position, both laterally and vertically.
ABANDONMENT:
Should it become necessary to abandon a tunnel for any reason, pressure grout the abandoned hole to prevent damage to surrounding earth and structures. When the tunnel liner is retained, fill entire tunnel with grout and pressure grout any voids about the tunnel liner exterior.
TUNNEL LOCATIONS:
Locate tunnels as indicated on the drawings or by City.
To facilitate construction, changes in tunnel location may be permitted. Proposed changes must be submitted by the Contractor. Changes in location must be acceptable to the City, and any utility company or public agency having jurisdiction over the location.

  â€ƒ Definition of Pipe Foundation Terms:
Trench depth is the vertical distance from pipe invert or flow line to finished ground surface.
Trench width is the horizontal distance between trench walls at any point from one foot above top of pipe to trench bottom.
Class B Bedding may be achieved by either of the following two construction methods.
(1)
Shaped Bottom with Tamped Backfill: Shape bottom of trench excavation to conform to a cylindrical surface with a radius at least 2 inches greater than the radius to the outside of the pipe and with a width sufficient to allow six-tenths of the width of the pipe barrel to be bedded in fine granular material fill placed in the shaped excavation. Carefully place and compact backfill at sides of pipe to a thickness of at least 12 inches above top of pipe. Limit use of this bedding method to trenches with firm bottom and sides.
(2)
Compacted Coarse Granular Bedding With Tamped Backfill: Bed pipe in compacted coarse granular material placed on a flat trench bottom. Thickness of granular bedding must be at least one-fourth the outside pipe diameter, but not less than 4 inches thick under pipe barrel, and extend at least halfway up the pipe barrel at the sides. Carefully place compacted backfill above the granular material up a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of pipe.
Class C Bedding may be achieved by either of the following two construction methods:
(1)
Shaped Bottom: Bed pipe with ordinary care in an earth foundation formed in the trench bottom by a shaped excavation which fits the pipe barrel with reasonable closeness for a width of at least 50 percent of the outside pipe diameter. Place compacted fill to a minimum depth of six inches above top of pipe.
(2)
Compacted Coarse Granular Bedding with a Tamped Backfill: Bed pipe in compacted granular material placed on a flat trench bottom. Thickness of granular material must be at least 4 inches under the barrel and must extend one-tenth to one-sixth of the outside diameter up the pipe barrel at the sides. Place compacted backfill above the granular material to a minimum depth of six inches over top of pipe.
Class C Modified Bedding is defined as bedding pipe on a bedding blanket of sandy material roughly shaped to fit bottom of pipe. Thickness of bedding blanket must be not less than 0.1 of the nominal pipe diameter. Place compacted backfill above bedding blanket to a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of pipe.
PIPE LAYING:
When either bituminous coated corrugated aluminum or corrugated plastic pipe is used, pipe installation must be observed by a Georgia registered professional engineer engaged by the contractor or developer. Upon completion of the pipe installation and prior to acceptance by the City, the observing engineer is to furnish to the City a certification that the storm drainage pipe has been installed in accordance with the approved plans and these specifications. Acceptance by the City will not be considered without the engineer's certification.
Clean interior of pipe and all joints before laying. When pipe laying activity is not in actual progress, tightly cover open ends of sewer. Avoid permitting mud or other material from entering sewer at all times.
Avoid damage or shock in handling pipe and accessories. Inspect each length of pipe, and reject any defective piece. Carefully protect pipe in place from damage or displacement until backfilling operations are complete.
Lay and joint pipe in strict conformance with manufacturer's written recommendations as submitted to and accepted by the City.
Where cement joints are used, provide wet burlap or earth protective cover for joints immediately after initial grout [is] set. Maintain protective cover until joint is covered by backfilling. Lay all pipe upgrade with spigots pointing downgrade.
Control geometric position of pipe as necessary to ensure that pipe and fittings accurately conform with required grade and alignment after sewer is completed.
Prevent water from accumulating or running in trench during pipe laying operations, and until the trench or excavation has been backfilled.
Remove and re-lay any length of pipe which does not accurately conform with required line or grade, is crushed, or is excessively deflected.
PIPE CONNECTIONS:
Make all pipe connections with standard fittings, manholes, structures, or special construction detailed on Drawings.
At manholes and structures, neatly cut all connecting pipe flush with inside surface, and provide flexible pipe joint within 18 inches of outer surface. Make pipe connections to manholes and structures by laying pipe in mortar bed or concrete. Use supplemental materials and techniques as required to obtain watertightness.
Do not connect any flow to new work until authorized by the City.
SEWER STRUCTURES:
Conform with applicable provisions contained in Article V of the City's Development Regulations.
LINE CLEANING:
Avoid permitting dirt, rubbish, surplus construction material, and other foreign matter to enter structures or pipe during construction. Use whatever means may be necessary to obtain a clean and internally smooth sewer system prior to final acceptance.
SEWER LEAKAGE:
General Leakage Requirements:
Make entire sewer line system as near watertight as practicable. Eliminate all visible points of ground water infiltration, and any other significant points of leakage which can be located.
