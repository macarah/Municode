ARTICLE XIII. - PUD, PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT

Sec. 1301. - Purpose and intent.
The Planned Unit Development District is intended to provide flexibility in the application of area, height, bulk, placement, and other zoning controls; provide for mixing a wide variety of residential housing types and arrangements; provide for the mixing of compatible residential, office, commercial and industrial land uses; encourage imaginative and innovative design for the unified development of tracts of land; provide an alternative for more efficient use of land, resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets, thereby resulting in lower construction and maintenance costs to the public; preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within the development; and to promote land development in proper relation to the surrounding neighborhood.

Sec. 1304. - Site plan approval required.
Applications for rezoning to, or development within a Planned Unit Development District shall require a site plan including, as a minimum, those items enumerated in Section 2606, Site Plan Requirements, of these regulations. The Zoning Administrative Officer, Planning Commission and/or City Council may require, in addition, such other information, studies, plats, plans, or architectural elevations deemed necessary to perform an adequate review of the proposed application.

Sec. 1306. - Revisions to approved PUD application.
Any additions in the types of land uses, increases in square footage or density, decreases in lot sizes, changes in the location or dimensions of streets, decreases in dwelling unit floor areas, major alterations in the land use patterns, or other substantial changes which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrative Officer, result in a development of such intent and character which has not been conceptually approved by the Governing Body shall require additional approval in accordance with procedures established in Article XXVI. Otherwise, minor changes may be approved by the Zoning Administrative Officer prior to issuance of building permits.

Sec. 1308. - Suggested site planning guidelines.
The following specifications are not regulations, but recommended guidelines to be utilized in preparation of site plans for Planned Unit Developments:
1.
Land uses which have traditionally been viewed as incompatible (e.g. single-family subdivision and a manufacturing plant) should not be proposed in the same Planned Unit Development unless considerable screening and physical separation is provided.
2.
Office, commercial and/or industrial uses should be located adjacent to major thoroughfares or in other areas with suitable access that will not result in traffic through residential areas.
3.
Lot sizes, lot widths, unit sizes and other characteristics of residential development within the Planned Unit Development should be similar to those characteristics of adjacent or nearby residential subdivisions or provide a suitable transition from such adjacent uses.
4.
Location of land uses should conform substantially with land use plan goals, policies and suggested types of uses.
5.
Street lengths, alignments, patterns and other characteristics should conform to city subdivision regulations or standard planning principles.
6.
Proposed developments should make maximum use of natural features of the land.
7.
For developments that are predominantly residential, only limited commercial uses (up to 10,000 square feet, or 10% of the total development site area) of a convenience retail nature, internally oriented and intended to serve the needs of the residents of the development, should be proposed.
