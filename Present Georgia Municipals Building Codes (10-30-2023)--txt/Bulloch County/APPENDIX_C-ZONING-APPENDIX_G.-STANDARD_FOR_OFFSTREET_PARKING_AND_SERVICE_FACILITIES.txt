In any case in which provision for ingress and egress involves the lowering or cutting away of curbs, such a curb cut is subject to the following provisions:
(1)
Only one combined entrance and exit is allowed for any parcel of property with a frontage on any one street of less than 50 feet. No more than two combined entrances and exits are allowed for any parcel of property with a frontage on any one street of between 50 feet and 200 feet. For parcels of property having frontage on any one street of more than 200 feet, additional entrances or exists are permitted only after the developer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning commission that more curb cuts are needed for safety reasons, and such additional curb cuts are approved by the planning commission.
(2)
At street intersections, curb cuts must be located at least 25 feet from the intersections of the two curb lines (or such lines extended) or at least 15 feet from the intersection of the two intersecting property lines (or such lines extended), whichever is less.
(3)
The distance between any two curb cuts on the same side of the street and located on one property must be at least ten feet. That distance is measured between the points at which the two curb cuts begin to deviate from the established curb line of the abutting street (in other words, between the intersections of the curb return radii and the established curb line of the abutting street).

However, the zoning administrator may approve a specified larger width for a truck stop, if he determines that a larger curb cut is needed for safety reasons.
(7)
The sum of the two curb return radii for any one curb cut must not exceed 15 feet.
