d.
When an employee has been accused of serious misconduct or criminal behavior, the employee may be suspended with pay for a period of five days, during which the city administrator will conduct or have conducted an investigation to determine whether the pending charges will affect the employee's job performance or whether the conduct which resulted in the arrest is the basis for disciplinary action. Where the city administrator determines that an employee's return to work would not be in the best interests of the city, the employee will be given notice of his proposed indefinite suspension without pay, including the reasons for the suspension, and the employee will be given an opportunity to respond to the city administrator concerning those reasons. After the employee has had an opportunity to respond, the city administrator will issue a decision on the indefinite suspension.

Sec. 28-12. - Grievance and appeal procedures.
(a)
Intent.
(1)
City employee grievances should receive prompt consideration and equitable resolution. Wherever possible, grievances should be resolved or adjusted informally, and both supervisors and employees shall be expected to make every effort to do so. With respect to those grievances which cannot be so resolved, employees shall be entitled to process the grievances as hereinafter provided.
(2)
These procedures governing the processing of grievances and providing the right of appeal are established for the purpose of eliminating or correcting justifiable complaints or dissatisfaction of regular employees or certain complaints of probationary employees and applicants (see subsection (b) of this section); ensuring that all employees shall be afforded fair, equitable and expeditious review of their grievances without fear, coercion or discrimination; and providing a systematic and orderly method for resolving complaints and differences between employees and supervisory or management personnel.
(b)
Procedure for grievance resolution. Any regular employee in the classified service who has been demoted, suspended, dismissed or subjected to any other type of disciplinary action (except oral or written reprimand), or who is aggrieved as a result of the interpretation and application of these rules and regulations, and any applicant or employee (regular or probationary) who has been subjected to any alleged discriminatory action that is prohibited by federal law, shall have the right to utilize the grievance and appeal procedure hereinafter set forth.
(1)
A formal grievance shall not be initiated unless and until the employee has discussed the grievance with the department head and city administrator or in the case of an applicant, with the city administrator. Such discussion shall be held within ten working days after the employee becomes aware of the occurrence of a grievable matter. The department head, or city administrator, in the case of an applicant, shall render a decision on the matter within ten working days after the grievance has been discussed.
(2)
Should the employee or applicant not be satisfied with the decision of the department head or city administrator, the employ or applicant, within five working days, shall state the grievance in writing and file a standard grievance form with the city administrator setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The city administrator shall make appropriate inquiries; consider all facts surrounding the action, and make effort to resolve the grievance to the satisfaction of the department head and the employee, or the applicant.
(3)
Should no decision resulting in the settlement of the grievance be reached within ten working days after the filing of the written grievance, the employee or applicant, within five working days, may appeal to the city council. Such appeal shall be submitted through the city administrator and shall be accompanied by all of the facts and information concerned with the grievance as well as any written responses of the department head.
(4)
The city council shall, within 15 working days after the receipt of an appeal, hold a hearing upon same and consider the action complained of in the grievance.
a.
Whenever possible, the hearing shall be scheduled during normal working hours and employees, supervisors, applicants and their representatives and witnesses shall have the right to appear before the council for the purpose of presenting facts, information and relevant evidence.
b.
At the hearing before the city council, technical rules of evidence shall not apply. All testimony before the council shall be under oath or affirmation. Any member of the council shall have the power to administer oaths and call witnesses and may compel the production of relevant books, records and documents.
c.
A copy of the decision of the city council shall be given to the affected employee and the department head of same, or to the applicant, within three working days following the completion of the hearing.
(5)
The failure of supervisory employees to follow the steps outlined above shall result in conferring upon the employee the right automatically to proceed to the next step in the grievance procedure. The failure of the employee to follow the steps outlined above may result in the dismissal of the grievance at any step.
(6)
In those cases where dismissal of an employee is involved, the city administrator shall immediately notify the affected employee that, if requested, a hearing before the city council will be set up and held within 15 working days of the action taken. At all such hearings, the department head shall be required to appear and explain the reasons for the dismissal.
(7)

Sec. 28-17. - Nepotism.
It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that no department head, the mayor or member of the city council, or city administrator shall appoint or employ any person to any regular classified position in the city who is a member of the immediate or extended family of such officer if such appointment or employment would cause a relative of such officer to come under the direct supervision of such officer. The employment of relatives is not prohibited by the city as long as none of the related persons are employed in a supervisory role when they might have an effect on a relative's progress, performance or welfare as an employee. An employee may not be promoted into a position in which they would have supervisory responsibility over a relative, unless the relative can be transferred to another position that would not be under the supervision of the relative that is being promoted. For this nepotism policy, relatives are defined as spouse, mother, father, stepmother, stepfather, son, daughter, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, stepson, stepdaughter, half-brother, half-sister, grandchild, grandparent and grandparents of spouse.

(b)
Publicity. The city administrator shall see that information about job opportunities and the equal employment policy of the city is readily available to all citizens of the city and especially to all potential job applicants.
(c)
Appeals based on alleged discrimination. Any applicant or employee who believes that he has been discriminated against shall have the right to counsel with city administrator and to avail himself of the grievance procedure outlined in section 28-12.

Affirmative action plan. The mayor and city council may adopt an affirmative action plan to formulate actions to correct employment practices which have, or potentially could have, a negative impact upon minority groups or females.
(Code 1985, § 3-918)
Sec. 28-19. - Political activities.
No employee in the classified service shall engage in political activities at the workplace or during business hours.
(Code 1985, § 3-919)
Sec. 28-20. - Substance abuse policy.
The city is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when any city employee illegally uses drugs on or off the job, comes to work under the influence, possesses, distributes or sells drugs in the workplace, or abuses alcohol on the job. Therefore, the city has established the following policy:
(1)
Violations.
a.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job.
b.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or while possessing in his body, blood, or urine illegal drugs in any detectable amount.
c.
It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or impaired by alcohol.
d.
It is a violation of the city policy for any employee to use prescription drugs illegally, i.e., to use prescription drugs that have not been legally obtained or in a manner or for a purpose other than as prescribed. However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications.
e.
Violations of this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
(2)
Employee assistance.
a.
The city offers resource information on various means of employee assistance in our community, including, but not limited to, drug and alcohol abuse programs. Employees are encouraged to use this resource file, which is located in the city hall personnel office.
b.
Information will be distributed to employees for their confidential use, upon request.
(3)
General procedures.
a.
An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to properly perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status.
b.
The supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse has occurred.
c.
If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, one of the following actions will be taken:
1.
The employee will be sent home.
2.
The employee, if unable to care for himself, will be sent to a medical facility.
Depending on the determination of the observed impairment, the employee may be accompanied by a supervisor, if necessary. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive.
(4)
Opportunity to contest or explain results.
a.
Employees and job applicants who have a positive confirmed test may explain or contest the result to the city within five working days after the city contacts the employee or job applicant and shows him the positive test result as it was received from the laboratory in writing.
b.
Any disciplinary action taken as a result of the test results will proceed once the test results are received and are not dependent upon the employee's right to explain or contest the results.
(5)
Confidentiality. The confidentiality of any information received by the city through a substance abuse testing program shall be maintained, except as otherwise provided by law. All information received through substance abuse testing is confidential, but may be disclosed in a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding in accordance with state law.
(6)
Pre-employment drug testing.
a.
Applicants to the city for positions that are sensitive from a safety, health or security standpoint will undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment. Any applicant with a confirmed positive test will be denied employment.
b.
Applicants will be required to submit voluntarily to a urinalysis test at a laboratory chosen by the city, and by signing a consent agreement will release the city, its officers and agents from liability. An applicant who refuses to submit to substance abuse testing will not be eligible for hire.
c.
If the physician, official, or lab personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe that the job-applicant has tampered with the specimen, the applicant will not be considered for employment.
d.
The city will not discriminate against applicants for employment because of a past history of drug abuse. It is the current abuse of drugs, preventing employees from performing their job properly, that the city will not tolerate. Individuals who have failed a pre-employment test may initiate another inquiry with the city after a period of not shorter than six months; but they must present themselves drug-free as demonstrated by urinalysis or other test selected by the city.
(7)
Employee testing.
a.
The city has adopted testing practices to identify employees who use illegal drugs on or off the job or who abuse alcohol on the job. It shall be a condition of employment for all employees to submit to substance abuse testing under the following circumstances:
1.
When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol. Reasonable suspicion is based on a belief that an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of the employer's policy drawn from those facts in light of experience. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon, but not limited to, the following:
(i)
Observable phenomena while at work such as direct observation of substance abuse or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being impaired due to substance abuse.
(ii)
Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance.
(iii)
A report or suspicion of substance abuse provided by a reliable and credible source.
(iv)
Information that any employee has caused or contributed to an accident while at work.
(v)
Evidence that any employee has used, possessed, sold, solicited, or transferred drugs while working or while on the city's premises or while operating the city's vehicle, machinery, or equipment.
2.
When employees have caused or contributed to an on-the-job inquiry that resulted in a loss of worktime, which means any period of time during which an employee stops performing the normal duties of employment and leaves the place of employment to seek care from a licensed medical provider. A supervisor may send employees for a substance abuse test if they are involved in on-the-job accidents where personal injury or damage to city or private property occurs.
3.
As part of a follow-up program of treatment for drug abuse.
4.
When a substance abuse test is conducted as part of a routinely-scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination that is part of the city's established policy or that is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification group.
5.
Upon request as part of a random drug screening program.
b.
Employees with a confirmed positive test result may, at their option and expense, have a second confirmation test made on the same specimen. An employee will not be allowed to submit another specimen for testing.
c.
If the physician, official, or lab personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has tampered with the specimen, the employee is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
d.
An employee who refuses to submit to substance abuse testing will be subject to disciplinary action.
(8)
Alcohol abuse.
a.
The consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages on the city's premises is prohibited.
b.
An employee whose normal faculties are impaired due to the consumption of alcoholic beverages, or whose blood alcohol level tests positive, while on duty or on city business shall be guilty of misconduct, and shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination.
c.
Failure to submit to a required substance abuse test is misconduct and shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination.
(9)
Responsibility of city supervisors. It is the responsibility of the city's supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a drug problem. Although it is not the supervisor's job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and co-workers should encourage anyone who has a drug problem to seek help.
(10)
Goals and intent of policy. The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive, and drug-free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment with the city.
(Code 1985, § 3-921; Ord. of 1-3-2000)
