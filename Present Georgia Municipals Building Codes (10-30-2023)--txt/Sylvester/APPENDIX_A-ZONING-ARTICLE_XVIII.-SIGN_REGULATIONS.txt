Editor's note— Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1, adopted Mar. 19, 2007, deleted Art. XVIII in its entirety and supplied provisions for a new Art. XVIII to read as set out herein. Former Art. XVIII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2004-12, § 1, adopted July 19, 2004; and Ord. No. 2003-02, adopted Jan. 21, 2003.

Section 18.01. - Purpose and findings.
The mayor and city council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. In addition with the volume of traffic in the city, uniform regulation of signage providing directional, commercial and non-commercial information to the public is essential.
By enacting this amendment, the mayor and council intend to:
(a)
Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
(b)
Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan;
(c)
Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings;
(d)
Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
(e)
Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
(f)
Maintain the historic image of the city;
(g)
Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
(h)
Promote economic development; and
(i)
Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
