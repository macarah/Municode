Adjacent residential property.

These districts shall be screened from such contiguous residentially zoned district. Such greenbelt shall be planted with deciduous trees, evergreens, flowering trees and/or ornamental trees set not closer than six feet to the fence or wall.
The remainder of the landscaped area which is not planted with the aforementioned stock shall be in well-kept lawn. All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition.
All planting plans shall be first submitted to the planning commission for approval as to suitability of planting materials and arrangement thereof in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, subject to city approval.

Section 4.17. - Conditional uses.
(Public hearing required). Before a building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a conditional use, application shall be made to the planning commission, which, after careful review of any applicable sections of this ordinance, may recommend to the city council the issuance of such permit or approval, if, in the judgment of the planning commission, it will not be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of the City of Sylvester.
An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a review by the planning commission and a determination by the City of Sylvester Mayor and Council that:
A.
The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this ordinance.
B.
The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood, nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers.
C.
The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fume generation, or type of physical activity.
D.
The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses; and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use.
E.
The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted have been met.
F.
Provided that the city council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and, provided that, wherever the city council shall find, in the case of any permit granted, pursuant to the provision of these regulations, that any terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
Section 4.18. - Appeals and variances.
modified
A.
The City of Sylvester Mayor and Council shall hear and decide appeals where there is alleged error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in enforcement of this ordinance.
B.
The mayor and council may authorize, in specific cases, such hardship variances from the terms of this ordinance as will not, in its opinion, be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance will be observed, and public safety and welfare secured. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the mayor and council that:
1.
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; and
2.
The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and
3.
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
4.
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building which use is prohibited by this ordinance. The city will control the actual use of properties through zoning and conditional uses and not through a grant of variance.
C.
Variances will first be reviewed by the Sylvester Planning Commission and recommendation made to the city council. (Public hearing required.).

Section 4.19. - Guesthouses.
A.
Number. Guesthouses are accessory structures which are allowed in the agricultural and residential zoning districts, subject to City of Sylvester water, gas and light, and sewage hookup approvals. Only one guesthouse is allowed per parcel or lot. Any living area included in a detached garage or swimming pool cabana is a guesthouse.
B.
Size. The heated and finished floor area of a freestanding guesthouse shall not exceed 75 percent of the square footage of the heated and finished floor area of the principal dwelling. When a guesthouse is combined with a detached garage or cabana, the guesthouse portion of the structure shall not exceed 75 percent of the heated and finished space contained in the principal dwelling.
C.
Use prohibited. A guesthouse which is inhabited by a person or persons based upon an oral or written lease for value is prohibited. In the event an accessory structure which satisfies the requirements of this section is inhabited by a person or persons based upon an oral or written lease, the accessory structure, for purposes of this ordinance, shall be construed to be a principal structure. No more than one principal structure shall occupy any residentially or agriculturally zoned lot or parcel.

Should the mayor and council determine at any time that any of the terms, conditions, or restrictions upon which special permission was granted are not being complied with, the mayor and council may rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
