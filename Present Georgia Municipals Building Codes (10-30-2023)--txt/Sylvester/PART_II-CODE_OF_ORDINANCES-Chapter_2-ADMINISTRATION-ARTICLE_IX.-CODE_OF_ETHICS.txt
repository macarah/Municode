--- (10) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-07, § 1, adopted June 15, 2009, supplied provisions to be added to this Code as §§ 2-430—2-441. In order to maintain the style of the Code, at the discretion of the editor, these provisions have been redesignated as §§ 2-670—2-681 to read as set out herein.

Sec. 2-670. - Intent.
It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the City of Sylvester that the members of its governing authority be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the governing authority. The governing authority finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority in situations where a conflict may exist.
(Ord. No. 2009-07, § 1, 6-15-2009)
Sec. 2-671. - Definitions.
