A.
Planned unit developments. The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in lots of record, would, in certain cases of large scale developments, have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects in adjoining properties. Therefore, the zoning regulations, relative to area, height, bulk and placement, may be modified by the planning commission and city council in the case of a plan for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the planning commission and city council, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed that of the zoning regulation requirements, and, provided further, that the minimum site for residential planned unit development is three acres.
B.
Refer to section 7.01 (R-PUD).
C.
Refer to section 13.01 (C-PUD).
