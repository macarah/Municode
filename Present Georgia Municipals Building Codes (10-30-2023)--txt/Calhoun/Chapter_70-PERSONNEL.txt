Sec. 70-31. - Purpose of personnel system.
(a)

This system shall provide means to recruit, select, develop, and maintain an effective and responsive work force, and shall include policies for employee hiring and advancement, training and career development, salary administration, fringe benefits, discharge and other related activities. This article does not limit the right of an "at-will" employee or the city to terminate the employment relationship at any time. The system herein established shall be consistent with such principals as:
(1)
Recruiting, selecting, and advancing employees on the basis of their relative ability, knowledge and skills, including open consideration of qualified applicants for initial appointment;
(2)
Providing equitable and adequate compensation;
(3)
Training employees, as needed, to assure high quality performance;
(4)
Retaining employees on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, correcting inadequate performance, and separating employees whose inadequate performance cannot be corrected;

Assuring fair treatment of applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to political affiliation, race, color, national origin, sex, age, disability or religious creed and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights as citizens; and
(6)
Assuring that employees are protected against coercion for partisan political purposes and are prohibited from using their official authority for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or a nomination for office as stipulated in this article.
Nothing in this article shall prohibit the establishment or continuing use of an affirmative action program that is in compliance with all applicable state and federal legislation and constitutional provisions.
(b)
The city will base all decisions on employment so as to further the principal of equal employment opportunity.
(c)
All personnel hired and promoted will be selected from all applicants on the basis of qualification felt essential for an employee to perform well, including such factors as ability, availability, capability, aptitude, experience, education, health, and willingness to work and serve. All personnel hired after the date of the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived and any personnel on probationary status on said date shall be considered as employed at will, which means that the city may terminate from service the employee at any time, with or without cause.
(d)
The city will ensure that promotion decisions are in accordance with the principal of equal employment opportunity by imposing only valid requirements for promotional opportunities. All personnel actions such as compensations, benefits, transfers, layoffs, and returns from layoffs, will be administered without regard to race, creed, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, mental and physical condition, marital status, or political belief.

Sec. 70-34. - Nature of employment, appeals and hearings.
(a)
Any city employee who becomes employed after the date of passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived will be classified as an employee "at-will." The term "at-will" means an employee is free to resign at any time, with or without cause. Likewise, the term "at-will" means the city may terminate an employee's employment, with or without cause or advance notice, as long as the city does not violate any applicable federal or state law. An at-will employee is not entitled to appeal the decision of the city to dismiss the said employee.
(b)
Any city employee whose office or position is allocated to permanent appointment (the appointment of an employee to a full-time position which is considered to be a continuous year-round position, with benefits associated with the type of position) and was so employed before the passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived, who has been demoted for cause, suspended, dismissed, or has been given a third written reprimand within a 12-month period (hereinafter called a "disciplinary action") shall be allowed the following appeal rights by filing a written demand for a hearing with the director ofhuman resources (DHR) within five working days of written notice from the city of such disciplinary action:
(1)
The mayor and council shall serve as the city personnel review panel (hereinafter "panel") or they may appoint a city personnel review examiner (hereinafter "examiner"). The panel or examiner shall be impartial and shall conduct hearings to review the disciplinary action. The panel or examiner is granted the authority to sustain or reverse the disciplinary action. If a panel is convened, the mayor shall act as the presiding officer and shall vote in the event of a tie vote among the panel members. A quorum of three shall be competent to conduct hearings and should the mayor not be a part of the quorum, then a presiding officer shall be elected from the quorum from its assembled members and such presiding officer shall conduct the hearing and vote only in the event of a tie vote among the remaining panel members.
(2)
The charges supporting the disciplinary action shall be specified by the city attorney in a written notice which, together with a copy of this section, shall be delivered personally or by mail addressed to the employee either at his last known address within ten working days after a written demand for a hearing is timely filed by the employee with the DHR.
(3)
In the event of such demand, a hearing shall be scheduled by the panel or the examiner, with not less than five working days' notice to the parties. The notice shall be in writing and shall include the date, time, and place of the hearing, and a short statement of the issue(s) involved.
(4)
The hearing is intended to be less formal than a court hearing, but orderly. To ensure orderliness, the hearing procedures of a civil case in courts of record in the state will be followed, however, the Georgia Civil Practice Act does not govern the hearing proceedings. The city attorney will represent the interests of the city at any hearing and the employee may represent himself or may choose to be represented by an attorney.
(5)
With respect to any such hearing, the mayor, upon written application of any party, shall issue subpoenas requiring the appearance of witnesses for the purpose of taking evidence or requiring the production of any books, papers or documents relevant to the inquiry.
(6)
The panel or examiner shall enter its written decision within ten working days after completion of the hearing or the compilation of any written transcript if the hearing was recorded and either serve a copy of such decision upon the employee personally or by mail addressed to the employee at his last known address.
(7)
Any employee aggrieved by a decision of the panel or examiner regarding his or her appeal of a disciplinary action may apply for a writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Gordon County, Georgia.
(8)
All hearings either before the panel or examiner involving a disciplinary action shall be open to the public.

If there is a question as to whether or not an employee's concern is clearly a grievance, either the employee or his immediate supervisor must contact the director of human resources (DHR) immediately in writing.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohols, including methyl and isopropyl alcohol.
Alcohol level or concentration means the alcohol in a volume of breath expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as indicated by an evidential breath test conducted using a breathalyzer approved by the state department of public safety.
Controlled substance means any drug, substance or immediate precursor in schedules I through V of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-13-25—16-13-29, and schedules I through V of 21 CFR 1308, and marijuana.
Drug and alcohol testing may include, but is not limited to, urinalysis, breath analysis or blood sample testing and is limited to the detection of the following substances: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).
Illegal drugs means drugs for which the possession, use, sale or distribution is unlawful pursuant to the laws of the state or any federal law or regulation. Illegal drugs for the purpose of this article include drugs which are legally obtainable but have been obtained illegally.
Intoxicating substance means any substance which produces changes in one's physical, mental or emotional state or behavior, including but not limited glue, paint thinner, etc.
Possession means having controlled substances which are not obtained either directly from a doctor or pharmacist using a valid prescription, or having controlled substances, the possession of which is unlawful pursuant to the laws of the state or any federal law or regulation.
Refusal to submit (to an alcohol or controlled substance test) means that a city employee:
(1)
Fails to provide adequate breath for alcohol testing as required under this article, without a valid medical explanation, after he has received notice of the requirement for breath testing in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(2)
Fails to provide an adequate urine sample for controlled substances testing as required under this article, without a genuine inability to provide a specimen (as determined by a medical evaluation), after he has received notice of the requirement for urine testing in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(3)

Reportable incident means any personal injury or property damage involving a city employee that occurs on or off city property during assigned work hours, or any time a city employee is using a city vehicle or wearing a city uniform.
Safety sensitive positions means any position or activity which has a direct and imminent impact on public health and safety, tasks or activities which are fraught with such risks of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of attention can have disastrous consequences, and tasks or activities that can cause a great human loss before any signs of impairment become noticeable to supervisors or others. Such positions or activities can include, but are not limited to, the operation of any city motor vehicle or "industrial" equipment, the use of deadly physical force or weapon (typically a firearm), tasks which involve high voltage or hazardous chemicals, or activities which involve life saving techniques.

For the purposes of this definition, a blood alcohol level of 0.04 percent alcohol in the blood by weight shall be considered to be sufficient to establish that an employee is under the influence.

(a)
The city is concerned with those situations where use of alcohol, intoxicating substances or other drugs is detrimental to the public trust or safety of employees or citizens.
(b)
Early recognition and treatment of chemical dependency problems is important for successful rehabilitation to improve job performance and reduce personal, family and social disruption. Employees who participate in a program for the purpose of treating alcoholism or drug addiction may do so without jeopardizing their employment with the city, provided they stop all involvement with alcohol or other drugs. Participation in such programs will not automatically prevent disciplinary actions for incidents that have already occurred. Should a rehabilitation program be necessary, leaves of absence may be used in accordance with current policies.
(c)
To implement this article, the rules set forth in this division are established as conditions of employment with the city.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3, 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3, 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-92. - Preemployment and pretransfer testing.
(a)
After a conditional offer of employment, all applicants for any city job position shall submit to a test for drugs and alcohol. The city will not hire any applicant who tests positive on a detection test for illegal drugs. The city will not hire any applicant who tests positive for alcohol at any level which could impair his ability to perform the job for which he applied to any appreciable degree. Such individuals will be prohibited from employment with the city for one year from the application date, unless they provide certified documentation of successful completion of a substance abuse rehabilitation program. Applicants who have completed a rehabilitation program will be subject to a drug screening prior to being employed.
(b)
Any city employee, before being transferred from a city job position to a city safety sensitive position (as defined in section 70-71), as a condition of such transfer shall submit to a test for drugs and alcohol. A refusal to submit to such tests will result in the city's refusal to transfer the employee to the safety sensitive position.
(c)
In instances where this article regarding preemployment and pretransfer testing conflicts with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the provisions of ADA and the Act of 1973 shall be followed.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(1), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(1), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-93. - Post-reportable incident testing.
Any city employee who is involved in a reportable incident (as defined in section 70-71) shall submit to a drug and alcohol test as soon as possible after such incident. No drug test will be administered later than 32 hours after the incident. No alcohol test will be administered later than eight hours after the incident. Whenever a test cannot be administered within these time limits, the employee's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the tests were not timely administered. Whenever an alcohol test is not administered within two hours after the incident, the employee's supervisor shall prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. An employee who is unable to submit to testing at the time of the incident because of serious injury received in the incident shall provide the city the necessary authorization for obtaining hospital reports or other documents that would indicate the presence of any controlled substances or alcohol in the employee's system at the time of the incident. Refusal to provide such authorization may be treated by the city as a refusal to submit to testing under this article.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(2), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(2), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-94. - Safety sensitive positions; random testing.
Any city employee in a safety sensitive position (as defined in section 70-71) shall be subject to a random selection process whereby such employees will be selected and requested to be tested for use of controlled substances and alcohol. The selection of method shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' social security numbers, payroll identification numbers or other comparable identifying numbers. Under this procedure at least 50 percent of city employees in safety sensitive positions will be subject to drug testing each calendar year and at least 25 percent of such employees shall be subject to alcohol testing each calendar year. Under the selection process used, each city employee in a safety sensitive position shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. All tests conducted under this section shall be unannounced and the dates for such random tests shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Upon notification of the random test, the employee shall proceed to the test site immediately; provided, however, if the employee is performing a safety sensitive function at the time of notification, the employee's supervisor shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety sensitive function in a safe manner before proceeding to the testing site.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(3), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(3), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-95. - Reasonable cause testing.
(a)
Any city employee shall submit to a drug or alcohol test whenever the city has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is using a controlled substance, illegal drug or alcohol. The city's decision to test an employee shall be based upon reasonable cause as determined from observation of the employee's actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct during assigned work hours or any time an employee is using a city vehicle or wearing a city uniform, which indicate the possible use of a controlled substance, illegal drug or alcohol. The actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct of the employee indicating possible drug or alcohol use must be witnessed by at least one supervisor in the department to which the employee is assigned. The supervisor who witnesses conditions warranting a drug test shall prepare and sign a statement describing the employee's conduct within 24 hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the test are released, whichever is earlier. Third-party reports that indicate the possible use of a controlled substance, illegal drug or alcohol in contravention of this article shall not constitute reasonable cause, but may be cause for the observation of the employee by a supervisor. The city will provide transportation to the testing site for any employee to be tested based upon reasonable cause.
(b)
If an alcohol test cannot be performed within two hours following a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not administered. If an alcohol test is not performed within eight hours of a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the test shall not be performed and the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not performed.
(c)
Reasonable cause or suspicion that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol includes, but is not limited to, any of the following criteria:
(1)
An employee seems disoriented.
(2)
Confirmed reports from police, citizens or other employees of drug or alcohol use or abnormal, potentially dangerous behavior.
(3)
Medical or physical information such as track marks.
(4)
Absenteeism or tardiness.
(5)
Any articulable facts which lead supervisors or department heads to believe an employee is in possession of drugs or alcohol, or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
(6)
The accumulation of facts that indicate an employee, because of drug or alcohol abuse, is unfit for duty.
(d)
The areas of observation listed in section 70-75 will be used as a guide for such determination.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(4), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(4), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-96. - Return to duty and followup testing.
Any employee who is not discharged following a violation of this article as it concerns alcohol may not resume his job without first having completed a recommended course of treatment of alcohol abuse and passing an alcohol test. Any employee who is not discharged following a violation of this article as it concerns controlled substances may not resume his job without first having completed a drug rehabilitation program and passing a controlled substances test. Upon resumption of his duties after completion of the alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, the employee will be subject to unannounced testing over a period of 12 to 60 months. At least six unannounced tests shall be conducted during the first 18 months after his return to duty. The type, frequency, and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of the city's substance abuse professional, who may terminate the testing at any point after the first six tests under this provision. Any positive test for either alcohol or controlled substances in a return to duty or follow up situation shall result in the immediate permanent discharge of the employee.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(5), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(5), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-97. - Fitness for duty.
Supervisors shall take appropriate action to protect city personnel and city property by removing from the work premises or site any individual not in condition to perform assigned work in a normal and safe manner. An employee who appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol shall be taken to the designated collection site for drug and alcohol testing. Employees shall not be allowed to drive any vehicle if it appears that they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If a drug or alcohol test cannot be administered under this article, the apparently impaired individual shall nonetheless remain ineligible to perform his duties for at least 24 hours.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(6), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(6), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-98. - Reports by employees.
If a city employee has reasonable suspicion that a supervisor is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the employee's observations shall be reported to the supervisor's immediate superior. If the employee feels that reporting these observations in this manner would adversely affect the employee's working conditions, the report may be made to the director of public works or the city administrator.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(7), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(7), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-99. - Exemption for prescribed medical treatment.
The use of a legally controlled substance as part of a prescribed medical treatment by a licensed physician will not subject a city employee to disciplinary action or a denial of employment if that treatment does not adversely affect job performance. Prescribed use must be substantiated by a physician's report or statement. If the use of the prescribed drug adversely affects an employee's job performance or is detrimental to the public trust or safety of other employees or citizens, it is in the best interest of the employee and the city for the employee to be placed on a leave of absence. Leaves of absence will be used in accordance with current personnel policies.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(8), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(8), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-100. - Compliance to be condition of employment.
Compliance with this article is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant conditionally offered employment or of an employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or procedure under this article or to sign any consent form or other document required by the testing laboratory or collection facility personnel shall be grounds for refusal to hire, termination or other disciplinary action.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 3(9), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 3(9), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-101. - Retesting; appeals.
Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a retest conducted of the original sample at a laboratory of the employee's or applicant's choice provided such laboratory shall be certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40. An employee or applicant shall request such retest within 72 hours from the time of notification of the original test results. The laboratory used for the retest shall have chain of custody procedures to ensure proper identification, labeling and handling of test samples and proper exchange with and return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following such retest, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug or alcohol test may file an appeal under the applicable appeal procedure.

DIVISION 3. - TESTING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES

Sec. 70-121. - Drug testing procedures.
(a)
The laboratory performing drug testing for the city under the terms of this article shall be certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40. The designated laboratory for performing drug tests pursuant to this article is Labcorp, 13900 Park Center Road, Herndon, VA 22071, and other future approved labs. Drug testing of covered employees shall conform to the following procedures:
(1)
Drug tests shall be performed on urine specimens collected in accordance with procedures and standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40.23 and 40.25.
(2)
All analysis of drug tests performed pursuant to this article shall meet the standards prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40.29. Urine specimens shall be tested only for evidence of use of the following prohibited drugs: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).
(3)
Urine specimens shall be collected at a designated collection site by a collection station person (CSP). A collection site will be any suitable location at which a specimen of urine can be collected under the required conditions for privacy, security, and temporary storage of the specimens. The collection site will have at least an enclosure for private urination, a toilet, some surface for writing, and a source of water for washing hands which, if practical, will be located outside of the privacy enclosure. Unless an employee is notified otherwise prior to a test, the designated collection site under this article shall be at Gordon Urgent Care located at 100 Hospital Court, Calhoun, Georgia 30701. Any one of the physicians affiliated with Gordon Urgent Care is also designated as the medical review officer for the purposes of this article. During specimen collection, the CSP will restrict access to the collection site. If the CSP is not a medical professional or if the employee has less than complete privacy, the CSP shall be of the same gender as the employee. Once the employee has completed giving the specimen, no person other than the CSP shall be permitted to handle the specimen until it is secured for transport. The CSP shall not observe the collection of urine except when there is reason to believe that the employee may alter or substitute the specimen. If the CSP has reason to believe the employee has tampered with a sample, another sample shall be drawn under the same gender observation. The CSP will use a standardized custody and control form to ensure that the chain of custody is maintained over a sample from the time it is received from the employee to the time of the analysis of contents to the ultimate return of results to the medical review officer. The CSP will also use a tamperproof seal system that prevents undetected opening of the specimen bottle and that identifies the sample with a number also appearing on the custody and control form. The CSP will also use a tamperproof shipping container which may be scaled and which allows the paperwork to be attached. Each urine specimen collected will be subdivided into two bottles labeled as "primary" and "split" specimen. Only the primary specimen will be opened and used for urinalysis. The split specimen bottle will remain sealed and will be stored at the laboratory. If analysis of the primary specimen confirms the presence of illegal controlled substances, employee will have 72 hours from the time of notification by the medical review officer to request that the split specimen be sent to another certified laboratory for a second analysis. A request for analysis of the split specimen will not stay any city actions or procedures otherwise required by this article.
(4)
Urine samples shall be analyzed using both a screen test and a confirmatory test. If the screen test result is negative, the laboratory will report the result of the test as negative. If a positive result for one or more controlled substances is obtained through a screening test, then a confirmatory test shall be performed for each identified drug. Only if the confirmatory test result is again positive will the laboratory report a positive result to the medical review officer.
(5)
The refusal of an applicant or employee to submit to a drug test or the failure to pass a drug test required by this article shall be cause for the refusal to hire an applicant as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge of an employee.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 4(A), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 4(A), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-122. - Drug reporting procedures.
(a)
The medical review officer (MRO) designated to receive, review, report, and file drug test information transmitted by the testing laboratory is Gordon Urgent Care, located at 100 Hospital Court, Calhoun, Georgia 30701. This MRO is a licensed physician who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders and who has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate drug test results.
(b)
The testing laboratory shall report test results only to the designated MRO. Test results shall not be transmitted verbally by telephone to the MRO. The testing laboratory and the MRO shall ensure the confidentiality of the transmitted information and shall limit access to any data transmission, storage, and retrieval system to ensure the security of the data transmission.
(c)
The MRO shall review drug test results in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR 40.33 and by the Federal Highway Administration in 49 CFR 391.97.
(d)
If the MRO determines that there is no legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed, positive drug test result other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, the MRO shall notify the human resources officer of his conclusions for further proceedings in accordance with this article.
(Ord. No. 623A, § 4(B), 11-24-1997; Ord. No. 756, § 4(B), 6-16-2003)
Sec. 70-123. - Alcohol testing procedures.
(a)
Alcohol tests shall be conducted using a breathalyzer approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). A breath alcohol technician (BAT) who is trained in department of transportation testing procedures shall administer all alcohol breath tests under this article.
(b)
The breath test shall be conducted in a place that offers visual and aural privacy to the employee. All necessary equipment shall be provided at the testing location, which shall be secured from unauthorized entry.
(c)
Prior to the test, the BAT will require the employee to provide positive identification. The BAT will explain the testing procedure to the employee before administering any test.
(d)
A breath test shall consist of a screening test and confirmatory test. The screening test will be conducted by first opening an individually sealed mouthpiece in view of the employee and attaching it to the testing device. The BAT will then instruct the employee to blow into the mouthpiece for a minimum of six seconds or until the device indicates that an adequate amount of breath has been obtained. The employee must then be shown the result shown on the device and the result recorded. If the screen test reveals a blood alcohol level below 0.02, no further testing is required and the test result is considered negative. If, however, the screen test result is 0.02 or greater, the BAT must perform a confirmatory test. The BAT shall not conduct a confirmatory test until the expiration of a waiting period of not less than 15 minutes and not more than 20 minutes from the initial test. A new mouthpiece shall be used. The confirmatory test shall be conducted using a testing device that prints out or otherwise provides a hard copy of the test results, the date and time, a sequential test number, and the name and serial number of the testing device. Whenever the results of the screen test and confirmatory test are not identical, the confirmatory test shall be deemed the final test result. A blood alcohol level of 0.04 or greater on the final test shall constitute a positive alcohol test result.
(e)
The alcohol testing of the city employees shall be conducted by qualified personnel of the city police department.
(f)
The refusal of an employee to submit to an alcohol test or the failure to pass an alcohol test required by this article shall be cause for disqualification from all driving duties, as well as cause for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Employees who have a blood alcohol level of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 when tested just before, during or just after performing any driving duties are ineligible to return to duty for at least 24 hours or until another breath test is administered for which the result is less than 0.02.
(g)
Employees who violate this article as to alcohol will be referred to a substance abuse professional for evaluation. The employee shall comply with any recommended treatment as a precondition to resuming his duties.

Furthermore, each employee who engages in any conduct prohibited by this article shall be evaluated by the city's substance abuse professional, who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and controlled substances use.
(b)
No aspect of this article shall require the city to provide an employee assistance program (EAP) for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this article and for supervisory personnel. From time to time, the city may provide an EAP for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this article. The availability of, and eligibility for, benefits under any such EAP shall be governed by the terms of the EAP. However, entry into, or participation in, any EAP shall not excuse an employee from the testing provisions of this article or requirements for removal from duty.
