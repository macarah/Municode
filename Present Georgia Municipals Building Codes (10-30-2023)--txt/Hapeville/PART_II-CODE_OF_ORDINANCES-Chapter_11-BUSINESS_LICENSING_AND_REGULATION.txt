ARTICLE 2. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

Sec. 11-2-1. - Findings; public purpose.
(a)
The mayor and council, which is the governing body of the City of Hapeville, Georgia (the "city"), is aware of the following evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and council of the city:
(1)
Findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986) and Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976), and in articles and studies in other communities including, but not limited to: Rome, Georgia; Adams County, Colorado; New York, New York; Newport News, Virginia; El Paso, Texas; Manatee County, Florida; Bellevue, Washington; Kent, Washington; City of Sandy Springs, Georgia; Fulton County, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and other studies, articles, and court decisions; and
(2)
The opinion of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. of Georgia v. Fulton County, Ga., 596 F.3d 1265 (11th Cir. 2010), which discusses extensive evidence of negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments in Fulton County, Georgia incorporated into the record of the proceedings before the mayor and council of the city; and
(3)
Three articles authored or co-authored by Dr. Richard McCleary, Professor at the University of California, Irvine, entitled "Rural Hotspots: The Case of Adult Business" (2008); "Do Peep Shows 'Cause' Crime? A Response to Linz, Paul, and Yao" (2006); and "Do 'Off-Site' Adult Businesses Have Secondary Effects? Legal Doctrine, Social Theory, and Empirical Evidence" (2009), incorporated into the record of the proceedings before the mayor and council of the city; and
(b)
Based upon all of this evidence, the mayor and council of the city find:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses, also known as adult entertainment establishments, lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or inadequately controlled by the operators of the establishments. Sexually oriented businesses cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use, assaults and batteries, and corruption of public officials.
(2)
Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, may occur at sexually oriented businesses. Offering or providing private or semi-private space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
(3)
Adult entertainment establishments escalate and exacerbate undesirable community conditions, including, but not limited to, blight, diminished property values, increased need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increased burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council find such business establishments bring to a community. The secondary negative effects that are caused by such businesses are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts, but other forms of sexually oriented businesses that also have a deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts, and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include , but are not limited to adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift and novelty shops, and lingerie or nude modeling studios.
(4)
Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
(5)
Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses.
(6)
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities.
(7)
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in some areas of some sexually oriented businesses.
(8)
The findings noted in subsections (1) through (7) raise substantial governmental concerns.
(9)
Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(10)
The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other secondary negative effects as described herein.
(11)
It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
(12)
The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter.
(13)
The barring of such individuals from the management of adult entertainment establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
(14)
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities as described above, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city; and based on the findings of multiple courts around the country; and based on the documentary evidence submitted to the mayor and council, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country.
It is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total), under certain circumstances, in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community.
Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with commercial nudity and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are criminal activity, depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove referenced. The mayor and council find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city, as well, unless these regulations are adopted.
Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council that nude or semi-nude live entertainment and other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in the city and surrounding communities.
The mayor and council further find that each separate adverse secondary effect of adult entertainment businesses and sexually oriented businesses constitutes a substantial governmental interest, that each substantial governmental interest includes, but is not limited to, preventing future adverse secondary effects of both pre-existing sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment businesses in the city and those that may open in the future, and the viability of each separate substantial governmental interest of the city addressed herein does not depend upon any comparative analysis between adult entertainment businesses and non-adult entertainment businesses.
The mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the city, the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council of the city find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment, and find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions. The mayor and council further find that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To all of these ends, this chapter is hereby adopted.
Also based upon all of the information, studies, and findings in court decisions, as well as the well known and self evident conditions and secondary effects caused by the commercial exploitation of commercial nudity combined with the sale, dispensing and consumption of alcoholic beverages, the mayor and council also find and conclude that the sale, dispensing, or consumption of alcoholic beverages of any kind in an adult entertainment establishment as defined herein tends to independently create, aggravate, exacerbate, and add to all of those negative secondary effects set forth in this section. The purpose and intent of this article is to address and forestall those negative secondary effects in the city within the permissible limits and parameters of the Georgia and United States Constitutions.

Provide documentation to prove that the applicant meets or exceeds the conditions pertaining to the property to be licensed; provide an "as-built" survey prepared and certified by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer depicting the location of the structure which will operate as the adult entertainment facility.

(3)
Population equals 10,000 to 14,999, then two licenses may be issued, etc.
