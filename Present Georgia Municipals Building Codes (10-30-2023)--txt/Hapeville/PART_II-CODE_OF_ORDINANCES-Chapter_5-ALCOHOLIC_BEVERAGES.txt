The businesses of manufacturing, distributing, selling, handling and otherwise dealing in or processing alcoholic beverages are privileges and not rights pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 3-3-1, and such privileges shall not be exercised within the city limits without full compliance with all applicable licensing, regulatory, and revenue requirements of local, state and federal rules, regulations, and laws, including this chapter.

Except as specifically authorized in this chapter, no person, entity and/or business shall engage in the manufacture, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages in the city without first having obtained a license as provided under this article.
(b)
Except as specifically authorized in this chapter, no person, entity and/or business licensed for the sale of a particular class of alcoholic beverages may sell other classes of alcoholic beverages without obtaining a separate license required therefore.
(c)
Generally, no entity may hold more than two licenses total. The two licenses may be in a single class. Hotels may hold up to five licenses total as long as each licensed entity or facility is physically located or operated within one building.
(d)
All licensees hereunder must, within a six-month period after the issuance of a license, open for business the establishment referred to in the license and begin the sale of the product or products authorized by the license. Failure to open the establishment and begin the sale of such products within the six-month period shall serve as automatic forfeiture and cancellation of the unused license pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. No refund of a license fee shall be made to the licensee upon any forfeiture, abandonment, revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a license. Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, an alcohol license fee may be refunded on a pro-rata basis by vote of the mayor and council, upon an applicant's showing of good cause. All requests for refunds shall be made at least 90 days in advance of the date on which the applicant seeks for such license to cease, terminate and/or expire.
(e)
Immediately upon the sale or closing of a business licensed under this chapter, it shall be the duty of the licensee to surrender such license to the city clerk. The failure to surrender such license within 30 days of the sale or closing of a business shall be a violation of this chapter.
(f)
Any licensee who is a designated representative, partner and/or employee of a corporation, and thereafter severs such relationship with the licensed business, whether he resigns, retires or is fired, shall immediately file notice of such with the city clerk, in writing. If such person is no longer the designated licensed representative for the establishment due to such separation, he shall immediately surrender his license to the clerk. Failure to surrender a license, upon the licensees' separation from the establishment, and the continued manufacture and/or sale of alcohol at such location, shall constitute violations of this chapter and shall be punishable as provided by law.
(g)
Any license holder/applicant shall promptly notify the city manager, in writing, of any change in the interests in or ownership of the licensed business, the licensee and/or any change in the information stated in the original application for license. Any such change shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter and shall require the city manager's approval. A license holder/applicant's failure to notify the city manager of any such change within 30 days of the change shall be a violation of this chapter and grounds for suspension and/or revocation. Upon filing timely notice of such change, the licensee may continue to operate under the license until a decision is rendered by the city.
