Sec. 10-4. - Estimation of gross receipts; filing of returns.
(a)
All occupation taxes levied by this article are levied on the amount of business transacted during the current calendar year and the number of employees to be employed in the business conducted. However, for convenience of both the city and the taxpayer, those businesses subject to the occupational tax shall, on or before March 15, file with the finance department a return showing all gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year ending on December 31. This return showing preceding calendar year gross receipts shall be used as the total of gross receipts for making payments on the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The number of employees reported for the current year's business operations may be based upon the number of employees employed in the business conducted during the previous year. Applicants or owners engaged in the business shall be reported as employees of the business. For continuing businesses, the return required on or before March 15 showing the business' preceding year's actual gross receipts and number of employees shall also be used to adjust the estimated return for the same period. Should a business not continue or terminate during the year, such business shall notify the finance department's business occupation tax section and file a final return reporting the actual number of employees and those gross receipts not previously reported.
(b)
Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be set forth in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.
(c)
If a business is to begin on or after January 1 of the occupation tax year, the tax on such business shall be due and payable on the date of the commencement of the business and shall be based upon estimated gross receipts of the business from the date of commencement until the end of the calendar year. The business shall also file the required registration form. Differences shall be billed or credited to the business' occupation tax subsequent year's billing as required.
(d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a lawyer begins or continues business after January 1 of the occupation tax year, the tax on such business shall be due and payable on December 31 of the year in which the business begins or continues. Any lawyer failing to pay the occupation tax within 120 days after December 31 shall be considered delinquent and shall be subject to and shall pay a ten percent penalty of the amount of tax or fee due and interest as provided by state law. Such penalty shall be assessed in full on the 121st day of the year following the tax year in addition to interest on delinquent occupational taxes. In addition, a list of all delinquent lawyers may be sent to the State Bar of Georgia. The general penalty for continuing violations of this Code shall not apply to violations of this chapter by lawyers. Specifically, failing to comply with the article will not result in the city closing the business or penalizing the continued practice of law by fining, imprisoning or criminalizing noncompliance.

(g)
