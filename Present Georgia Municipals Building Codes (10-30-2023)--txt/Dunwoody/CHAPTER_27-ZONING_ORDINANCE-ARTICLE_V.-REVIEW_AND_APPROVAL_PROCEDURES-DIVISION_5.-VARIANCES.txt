The variance request is based on conditions that (1) are unique to the subject property (2) are not generally applicable to other properties in the same zoning district and (3) were not created by the owner or applicant;

Because of the particular conditions, shape, size, orientation or topographic conditions, the strict application of the requirements of this zoning ordinance would deprive the property owner of rights and privileges enjoyed by other similarly situated property owners;

The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other similarly situated properties;
(5)
The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of this zoning ordinance would cause undue hardship or practical difficulty, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience; and
(6)
The requested variance would be consistent with the spirit and purpose of this zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan.
(b)
The zoning board of appeals may authorize variances from the provisions of the noise ordinance only after making all of the following findings:

Because of the existence of exceptional conditions that were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of the noise ordinance would deprive the property owner of rights and privileges enjoyed by other similarly situated property owners;

The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and the applicant has exhausted the best practical noise control measures, such as those promulgated by INCE, without being able to conform to the noise levels established in the noise ordinance;
(3)
The grant of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zoning district in which the subject property is located;
(4)
The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of the noise ordinance would cause undue and unnecessary hardship; and
(5)
The requested variance would be consistent with the purposes of the noise ordinance and would not allow noise to exceed:

Ten dB(A) above what is allowed by the noise ordinance during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.; and
