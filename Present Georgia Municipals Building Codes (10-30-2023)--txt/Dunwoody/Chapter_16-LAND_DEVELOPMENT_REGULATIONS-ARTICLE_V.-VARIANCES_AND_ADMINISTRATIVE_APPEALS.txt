Editor's note— Ord. No. 2021-09-13, § VII, adopted Sep. 27, 2021, amended Art. V and in so doing changed the title of said Art. V from variances to read as set out herein.

DIVISION 1. - VARIANCES

Sec. 16-271. - Authority.
(a)
The zoning board of appeals is authorized to hear and decide applications for variances from the strict application of articles III or IV, where strict application of any of the regulations of this articles III or IV would result in exceptional and undue hardship to the owner of such property. These regulations provide the minimum necessary requirements; thus, variances from the requirements of articles III or IV may be authorized only upon the zoning board of appeals making all of the following findings:
(1)
By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of articles III or IV would deprive the property owner of rights and privileges enjoyed by other similarly situated property owners in the same zoning district;
(2)
By reason of the shape or topographical conditions of a parcel of property which were not created by the owner or applicant, there is no opportunity for development under any design configuration allowed by these subdivision regulations unless a variance is granted;
(3)
The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and does not constitute the grant of a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other property owners in the zoning district in which the subject property is located;
(4)
The requested variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; and
(5)
The requested variance will not in any manner vary the provisions of the city zoning ordinance, the city comprehensive plan or the zoning map of the city.
(b)
No variance may be granted by the zoning board of appeals to:
(1)
Allow any variance which conflicts with or changes any requirement enacted as a condition of zoning or of a special land use permit by the city council;
(2)
Increase the density allowed on the property; or
(3)
Vary the requirements set forth [in] section 16-241.
(c)
Applications for variances must be submitted in writing to the community development director along with the application for sketch plat approval or if a variance becomes necessary after the approval of the sketch plat, within 30 days of discovery of the conditions requiring such a variance from the preliminary plat. Applications must contain all those materials and documents required by the community development director that are necessary to demonstrate the necessity for the variance and compliance with the requirements of this Code. At a minimum, the variance application must contain a full explanation of the reasons for the variance and must include a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed without the variance and a plat that shows the proposed subdivision designed with the variance.
(d)
When the variance application is first considered by the zoning board of appeals, the community development director must provide the zoning board of appeals with written findings of fact and a recommendation for approval or disapproval of the variance.
(e)
Applications for variances that accompany the application for sketch plat approval must be heard by the zoning board of appeals prior to the approval of a sketch plat.
(f).
After the filing of a complete application for a preliminary plat variance, the application must be placed on the next available meeting agenda of the zoning board of appeals. All land development activity associated with a proposed variance from a preliminary plat must cease until a final decision on the variance is made by the zoning board of appeals. Land development activity that is not related to the proposed variance may continue unabated.
(g)
All decisions by the zoning board of appeals approving or disapproving a variance must be issued in writing and must provide the grounds for the decision of the zoning board of appeals. The zoning board of appeals must issue a final decision on a variance submitted with the application for a sketch plat at the same time that it issues the final decision approving or disapproving the sketch plat. The zoning board of appeals must issue a final decision on a variance from the preliminary plat within 50 days after the first meeting at which the zoning board of appeals considers the variance. If a final decision is not made on a subdivision plat variance in accordance with the time constraints set forth in this section, the variance will be deemed approved.
(h)
Any person or entity (i.e., an owner, applicant, adjoining neighbor or a neighbor whose property line is within 1,500 feet of the nearest property line of the proposed subdivision) aggrieved by a variance decision of the zoning board of appeals affecting a preliminary plat, may appeal such decision by filing a petition for writ of certiorari to the county superior court in accordance with state law.
