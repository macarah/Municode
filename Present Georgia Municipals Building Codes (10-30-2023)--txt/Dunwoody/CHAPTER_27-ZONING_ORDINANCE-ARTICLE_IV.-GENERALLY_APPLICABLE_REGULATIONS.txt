ARTICLE IV. - GENERALLY APPLICABLE REGULATIONS
DIVISION 1. - PARKING AND CIRCULATION

Sec. 27-201. - General.
(a)
Purpose.
(1)
The regulations of this division are intended to help ensure provision of off-street motor vehicle parking facilities, bicycle parking areas and other motorized and non-motorized transportation circulation facilities in rough proportion to the generalized demands of different land uses. By requiring such facilities, it is the intent of this division to help avoid the negative impacts associated with spillover parking into adjacent areas, while at the same time avoiding the negative environmental and visual impacts that can result from very large parking lots and other vehicular use areas.
(2)
The provisions of this division are also intended to help protect the public health, safety and general welfare by:
a.
Promoting multi-modal transportation options and enhanced pedestrian and cyclist safety; and
b.
Providing flexible methods of responding to the transportation and access demands of various land uses in different areas of the city.
(b)
Applicability.
(1)
General. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the regulations of this division apply to all districts and uses.
(2)
New uses and development. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the parking regulations of this division apply to all new buildings constructed and all new uses established in all zoning districts.
(3)
Change of use. When an existing or previously existing use fails to provide the number of off-street parking spaces required under this zoning ordinance and a new use is proposed the existing parking (deficit) may be continued. When the number of parking spaces required for the new use exceeds the number of spaces required for the use that most recently occupied the property, additional spaces are required only to make up the difference between the number of spaces required for the previous use and the number of spaces required for the new use, based on the regulations of this zoning ordinance.
(4)
Enlargements and expansions.
a.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the parking regulations of this division apply whenever an existing building or use is enlarged or expanded to include additional dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, employees or other units of measurement used for establishing off-street parking requirements.
b.
In the case of enlargements or expansions that trigger requirements for additional parking, additional spaces are required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire building or use. In other words, there is no requirement to address lawfully existing parking space deficits.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-12.10), 10-14-2013)
Sec. 27-202. - Maximum motor vehicle minimum bicycle parking ratios.
Except as otherwise expressly stated, off-street motor vehicle and bicycle parking spaces must be provided in accordance with the following table, provided that:
(1)
No use is required to provide more than eight bicycle parking spaces; and
(2)
The community development director is authorized to reduce minimum bicycle parking ratios for multi-tenant centers and other sites occupied by multiple uses when the director determines that common bike rack locations and overall bike parking availability will be adequate to meet bicycle parking demands on the subject lot.
(3)
Maximum parking ratios may be exceeded with construction of a multi-level parking deck, provided the footprint does not exceed the area of the maximum allowable surface level parking lot.

  [1] Parking requirements for shopping centers are calculated based on the area of the entire shopping center, rather than the individual uses within the center. This parking calculation provision applies only to shopping centers in which restaurants make up less than 50 percent of the center's gross floor area. Parking requirements for any drive-through uses within a shopping center are always calculated separately.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-12.20), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-05, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2017-04-07, § 4, 4-11-2017; Ord. No. 2019-07-14, § 1, 7-22-2019)
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2019-07-14, § 1, adopted July 22, 2019, changed the title of § 27-202 from "Minimum motor vehicle and bicycle parking ratios" to read as herein set out.
Sec. 27-203. - Calculation of maximum parking.
The following rules apply when calculating the maximum number of off-street parking spaces:
(1)
Multiple uses. Unless otherwise expressly stated, lots containing more than one use may not exceed parking in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses on the lot.
(2)
Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction of less than one-half is rounded down to the next lower whole number, and any fraction of one-half or more is rounded up to the next higher whole number.
(3)
Area measurements. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all area-based (square footage) parking standards must be computed on the basis of gross floor area.
(4)
Occupancy- or capacity-based standards. For the purpose of computing parking requirements based on employees, students, members, residents or occupants, calculations must be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or membership or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.
(5)
Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the community development director is authorized to apply the off-street parking ratio specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish a maximum off-street parking requirement for the proposed use in accordance with subsection (6).
(6)
Establishment of other parking ratios. The community development director is authorized to establish maximum off-street parking ratios for unlisted uses and in those instances where authority to establish a requirement is expressly granted. Such ratios may be established on the basis of a similar use/parking determination (as described in subsection (5)), on parking data provided by the applicant or information otherwise available to the community development director. Parking data and studies must include estimates of parking demand based on reliable data collected from comparable uses or on external data from credible research organizations (e.g., Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or American Planning Association [APA]). Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. Parking studies must document the source of all data used to develop recommended requirements.
(7)
On-street parking. Nonresidential uses shall count on-street parking spaces on public street rights-of-way abutting the subject property towards the off-street motor vehicle parking maximums for nonresidential uses. One on-street parking space credit shall be taken for each 20 linear feet of abutting right-of-way where parallel on-street parking is allowed. Credit for angled parking, where allowed, will be determined by the community development director. Only space on the same side of the street as the subject use shall be counted, except that the community development director is authorized to allow spaces on the opposite side of the street to be counted if the property on that side of the street does not have the potential for future development. In calculating credit for on-street parking, all fractional spaces are rounded down.
(8)
Outdoor dining areas.
a.
Except as otherwise expressly stated in this ordinance, maximum off-street parking requirements for eating and drinking establishments must be based on the amount of indoor and outdoor floor area.
b.
Outdoor dining areas containing up to 24 seats or no more than ten percent of the indoor public floor area devoted to customer seating (whichever amount is less) are not counted in determining maximum off-street parking requirements. All portions of outdoor seating areas that exceed ten percent the indoor public floor area devoted to customer seating and all portions of outdoor dining areas with a capacity of more than 24 seats must be counted in determining maximum off-street parking requirements.
(9)
Alternative compliance. The motor vehicle parking ratios of this division are not intended to prevent development and redevelopment or to make development and redevelopment economically impractical. In order to allow for flexibility in addressing the actual expected parking demand of specific uses, alternative compliance parking ratios may be approved through the special exception process (see article V, division 6) or the special administrative permit process (see article V, division 7) only if it is determined that the maximum motor vehicle parking ratios do not accurately reflect the actual parking demand that can reasonably be anticipated for the proposed use and the applicant provides a parking study or survey or a parking demand management plan in accordance with the following:
a.
The applicant submits a parking study or survey, prepared and sealed by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia with expertise in parking and transportation demonstrating that the motor vehicle parking ratios of section 27-202 do not accurately reflect the actual parking demand that can reasonably be anticipated for the proposed use.
(10)
Shared parking. Shared parking among different users is authorized provided that:
a.
The community development director is authorized to specify the shared parking methodology to be used or to require that the analysis be prepared by registered engineer in the State of Georgia with expertise in parking and transportation. The shared parking analysis must demonstrate that the peak parking demands of the subject uses occur at different times and that the parking area will be large enough for the anticipated demands of all uses.
b.
Required residential parking and accessible parking spaces (for persons with disabilities) may not be shared and must be located on site.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-12.30), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2019-07-14, § 1, 7-22-2019)
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2019-07-14, § 1, adopted July 22, 2019, changed the title of § 27-203 from "Calculation of required parking" to read as herein set out.
Sec. 27-204. - Reserved.
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2019-07-14, § 1, adopted July 22, 2019, repealed § 27-204, which pertained to motor vehicle parking reductions and derived from Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-12.40), adopted Oct. 14, 2013; and Ord. No. 2017-04-07, § 4, adopte April 11, 2017.

(a)
General. This section allows reduction of motor vehicle parking requirements in exchange for providing bicycle parking facilities in excess of minimum bicycle parking requirements. It also establishes location and design requirements for required and non-required bicycle parking facilities.
(b)
Replacement of motor vehicle parking spaces with additional bicycle parking spaces. Any nonresidential use may convert or substitute up to ten percent of required motor vehicle parking spaces in exchange for providing additional bicycle parking spaces at the following ratios, provided that the total motor vehicle parking reduction does not exceed 25 spaces:
(1)
A reduction of one motor vehicle parking space is permitted for each six short-term bicycle parking spaces provided. Bicycle parking spaces required under section 27-202 may not be counted in determining allowed vehicle parking reductions.

(5)
Commercial vehicles prohibited. Only licensed, operable motorcycles and passenger vehicles not operated as a common or contract carrier for hire may be parked outside of an enclosed building in residential zoning districts. This provision is intended to expressly prohibit the parking of commercial motor vehicles (as defined in O.C.G.A § 40-1-1) outside of an enclosed building, except for the immediate loading or unloading of goods or people. It also expressly prohibits the outdoor parking and outdoor storage of construction equipment such as tractors, skid steers, backhoes, forklifts, cement mixers and similar equipment. This prohibition does not apply to construction staging areas.
(6)

Off-site parking.
(1)
General. Up to 25 percent of the number of off-street parking spaces required for nonresidential uses may be provided off-site, in accordance with the provisions of this section. Off-site parking areas must comply with all applicable parking area design and accessibility standards. Required accessible parking spaces and parking required for residential uses may not be located off site.
(2)
Location. Off-site parking areas must be located within a 1,500-foot radius of the use served by such parking, measured between the entrance of the use to be served and the outer perimeter of the furthest parking space within the off-site parking lot. Off-site parking lots are allowed as of right only in zoning districts that permit either the principal use to be served by the off-site parking spaces or non-accessory parking uses. Off-site parking in other zoning districts requires review and approval of a special use special land use permit in accordance with the procedures of article V, division 3.
Figure 12-1: Off-site Parking, Maximum Distance Measurement
(3)
Control of off-site parking area. The property to be occupied by the off-site parking facilities must be under the same ownership as the lot containing the use to be served by the parking. The off-site parking area may be under separate ownership only if an agreement is provided guaranteeing the long-term availability of the parking, commensurate with the use served by the parking. Off-site parking privileges will continue in effect only as long as the agreement, binding on all parties, remains in force. If an off-site parking agreement lapses or is no longer valid, then parking must be provided as otherwise required by this division.
(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-12.60), 10-14-2013; Ord. No. 2015-01-05, § 1, 1-26-2015; Ord. No. 2022-08-13, § I, 8-22-2022)

(Ord. No. 2013-10-15, § 1(Exh. A § 27-12.70), 10-14-2013)
Sec. 27-208. - Parking area design.
(a)
Tandem and valet parking arrangements. Parking areas must be designed and constructed to allow unobstructed movement into and out of required parking spaces without interfering with fixed objects or vehicles except in the case of allowed tandem and valet parking, as follows.
(1)
Tandem parking. Tandem parking spaces may be used to satisfy residential parking requirements if the tandem spaces are assigned to the same dwelling unit.
(2)
Valet parking. Valet parking may be used to satisfy minimum off-street parking requirements for nonresidential uses if an attendant is present during all hours of operation. Valet parking arrangements may involve the stacked parking of vehicles (i.e., requiring one or more vehicles to be moved to obtain access to other parked vehicles). Valet parking is not subject to the maximum 1,500-foot off-site parking limit of subsection 27-206(c)(2).
