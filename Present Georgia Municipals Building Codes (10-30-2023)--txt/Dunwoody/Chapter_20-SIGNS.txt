ARTICLE I. - INTRODUCTION AND HOW TO USE THIS SIGN CODE

Sec. 20-1. - Purpose and intent.
The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard, a detriment to property values and to the city's general public welfare, and create an aesthetic nuisance. The city further finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations.
The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The mayor and council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, public utility signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power.
The city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signs by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to those persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to common developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls or where the state authorizes the department of agriculture to regulate the display of retail fuel station pricing and for the best interest of the public to advertise said prices. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.
The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting this chapter are as follows:
(1)
To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Dunwoody, and to implement the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan of the city through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the city;
(2)
To regulate the erection and placement of signs in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians;
(3)
To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed;
(4)
To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts;
(5)
To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interest of the city;
(6)
To establish comprehensive sign regulations that effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors;
(7)
To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for businesses which are located within the city, and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods or services so as to promote the economic vitality of businesses;
(8)
To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State of Georgia and United States Constitutions;
(9)
To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts;
(10)
To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive on lots, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits;
(11)
To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances;
(12)
To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs; and
(13)
To provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2021-10-17, Att. A, 10-11-2021)
Sec. 20-2. - Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall apply to all signs erected within the corporate limits of the city that are directed to be viewed from the outdoors. All erection, construction, reconstruction, enlargement, moving, altering, or converting of signs in the city shall be performed in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 2021-10-17, Att. A, 10-11-2021)
Sec. 20-3. - How to measure sign dimensions.
(a)
Sign height measurement.
(1)
The height of a sign shall be measured from the finished grade (as defined in Dunwoody Code section 27-621—Terms defined), which shall not be raised so as to create additional sign height, or the height of the roadway crown of the adjacent street which the sign faces, whichever is higher, to the highest point of the sign structure, including the bracket, supports, and any sign face surrounds. The above diagram illustrates sign height measurement.
(2)
All sign height standards herein shall be considered as measured above grade.
(b)
Sign area measurement.
(1)
For signs on a background, the entire area of the framework or background of the sign is calculated as the sign area, including any material or color forming the sign face or background used to differentiate the sign from the sign structure against which it is placed. (See diagram "A" below).
(2)
For signs consisting of freestanding letters or features attached to a wall, the sign area is calculated as the total area of the smallest hypothetical square, rectangle, triangle, or circle surrounding all letters or features. (See diagram "B" below). Sign area does not include any supporting framework or bracing unless such framework or bracing is part of the message or sign face. (See diagram "A" below).
(3)
Diagrams A and B.
(4)
For window signs, including neon window signs, the total sign area is measured by multiplying the full width of the overall sign copy, including the lettering, logo, and graphics, by the overall height of the sign copy in a rectangular manner, regardless of the arrangement of the copy.
(5)
When two sign faces are placed back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time and are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 24 inches at its furthest distance apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of the face with the largest sign area.
(Ord. No. 2021-10-17, Att. A, 10-11-2021)
Sec. 20-4. - Sign location.
(a)
Signs shall not be situated so that they interfere with the movement or visibility for pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, or in any way obstructs views of traffic signals and other traffic devices.
Signs and their supporting structures shall not interfere with public utility equipment or communication lines/equipment that are either above or below the grade.
(b)
At a minimum, signs shall not be located within the vision clearance triangle. The vision clearance triangle means the triangular area adjacent to the intersection of any street established by measuring a distance of 15 feet from the point of intersection of two streets along the right-of-way of each of the intersecting streets, or a distance of five feet from the point of intersection of a street and a driveway and connecting the ends of each measured distance to assure adequate visibility sight lines for vehicular traffic approaching the intersection. Exception: Wall signs and any other signs that are placed flat against a building wall are not subject to this requirement.
(Ord. No. 2021-10-17, Att. A, 10-11-2021)
Sec. 20-5. - Landscaping requirement.
An area around the base of each ground-mounted sign equal to the sign face area must be landscaped to improve the overall appearance of the sign and to reduce the risk of vehicles colliding with the sign or its supports. Landscaping must include natural vegetation and may include other materials and components such as brick or concrete bases or planter boxes. Within the vision clearance triangle, landscaping shall include only grass and/or a mulched landscape bed of annual plantings that do not grow higher than 24 inches.
(Ord. No. 2021-10-17, Att. A, 10-11-2021)
Sec. 20-6. - Owner's consent required.
No sign may be permitted or posted on property without the consent of the property's owner or authorized agent. Should it be determined that a sign was erected on a lot pursuant to an alleged agent's incorrect representation that the record owner of the lot in fact gave permission for the erection of a sign, or otherwise in violation of the requirement in this section, the permit for such sign shall be revoked as set forth in section 20-132 of this sign code.
(Ord. No. 2021-10-17, Att. A, 10-11-2021)
Sec. 20-7. - Sign maintenance.
All signs shall be maintained in safe and good structural condition, in compliance with all applicable building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this chapter at all times. Such maintenance includes replacement of all defective bulbs, parts, materials, painting, repainting, cleaning, and other acts required for maintenance of erected signs. If any sign does not comply with the above maintenance and repair standards, the city shall require its removal as set forth in section 20-9 of this sign code.
(Ord. No. 2021-10-17, Att. A, 10-11-2021)
Sec. 20-8. - Building code compliance.
To the extent that it is not inconsistent with this chapter, and except for administrative and permitting provisions of this sign ordinance, the present edition of the Standard Building Code, National Electric Code and other building and construction codes as adopted and modified by the city and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs are incorporated as a part of this chapter as if fully restated herein for the same purposes stated in section 20-1 hereof and for the same purposes for which the International Building Code was promulgated and enacted, which purposes are expressly incorporated herein.

modified
Certain sign types may be illuminated as indicated herein. The type of lighting depends on the sign type and district in which it is located as set forth herein. The following defines and provides example depictions of the various sign lighting types used in this chapter.
EXPAND
Sign Lighting Type Definition Example Graphic
Direct Lighting A specific style of illumination where the source of light is internal and integral to the sign structure and where the resultant illumination radiates out in the direction of the viewer. This designation includes neon lighting, face-lighted channel letters and sign panels with routed and push-through graphics (backlit).
Internal Box Lighting Signs that use a lightbox configuration where a light fixture is inside a box with the front surface consisting of a translucent panel that becomes illuminated on which information is displayed.
Shadow/Halo Lighting A specific style of illumination where the sign face and returns are mounted on standoffs away from the wall which project illumination to the wall surface giving the sign a halo effect. In some instances, lighting that creates a shadow/halo effect may be located on the interior of the lettering—this is permissible if the light radiation is not visible on the front surface of lettering, logos, or symbols, and the front is entirely opaque.
Indirect Lighting A specific style of illumination where the source of light is external to, and independent of, the sign structure, and the illumination radiates toward the message area away from the viewer. This includes goose neck, linear sign lights, and ground mounted spotlights.
