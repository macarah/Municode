(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 9, art. I, § 1)
Sec. 2-209. - Declaration of policy.
(a)
The city government is a representative democracy. Those who are elected, appointed, hired, volunteer or campaign to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. Public trust requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; and that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair.
(b)
It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government.
(c)
In adopting this article, the city recognizes that:
(1)
Public servants are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community;
(2)
Public servants retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights;
(3)
It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for public servants to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material and avoidable;
(4)
Public servants are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain investments.
(d)
This article provides the minimum standards which a public servant's conduct cannot fall without the risk of penalty. The principal policy which forms the foundation of this article is to encourage internal commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports integrity with pride and enthusiasm. A work environment which supports integrity includes public servants who:
(1)
Recognize with gratitude that the primary reason they hold a public position is to serve the public;
(2)
Are motivated and committed to pursue ethical ideals which always exceed minimum standards and often achieve the highest standards;
(3)
Encourage ethical practices which protect, advance and promote the public interest;
(4)
Recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically themselves, and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of others;
(5)
When they observe serious unethical practices, promptly disclose them to appropriate authorities, and encourage others to do the same;
(6)
Ensure that those for whom they are responsible are aware of minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of disciplinary consequences; and
(7)
When circumstances warrant, appropriately discipline those who are proven to have engaged in unethical behavior.
(Comp. Ords. 2008, ch. 9, art. I, § 2)
Sec. 2-210. - Purposes of article.
This article, including the definitions set forth in section 2-208, is adopted to:

Identify the minimum standards of ethical conduct which public servants must meet;
(2)
Adequately educate public servants, and any subordinates, in the principles of ethics;
(3)
Encourage public servants to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve;
(4)
Provide a process by which public servants may identify and resolve ethical issues;
(5)
Provide a process to ensure the prompt disclosure by public servants of serious unethical practices, and encourage others to do the same;
(6)
Provide a fair and impartial process by which alleged violations of this article may be heard;
(7)
Provide for a just and reasonable balance among the rights of all individuals who are directly affected by the operation of this article; and
(8)
Establish penalties, as appropriate, for public servants who violate the public trust.
