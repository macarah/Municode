(2)
The purchasing agent will arrange interviews between vendor representatives and department heads when it appears to be to the advantage of the county or when such an interview is requested by an appropriate county employee.
(3)
No county employee is required to place his time at the disposal or discretion of a salesperson; however, if any interview is to be denied, such denial will be acknowledged promptly, a reason given for not granting the interview and the suggestion offered to see the purchasing agent.

County employees are expressly prohibited from soliciting or accepting any rebate, money or costly entertainment, gift or gratuity from any person, company, firm or corporation to which any purchase order or contract is, or might be, awarded. The county will not tolerate circumstances that produce or reasonably appear to produce conflicts between the personal interest of an employee and the interests of the county; therefore, the county may terminate, at no charge to the county, any purchase order or contract if it is found that substantial gifts or gratuities were offered to a county employee. The county may also take disciplinary action, including dismissal, against a county employee who solicits or accepts gifts or gratuities of any value whatsoever.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § II(G), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-298. - Bid deposits.

(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § II(J), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-301. - Award of bid-based contracts.
The board of commissioners will award bid-based contracts upon the recommendation of the purchasing agent. The award will usually be to the lowest and best responsible bidder. When an award is recommended not to be made, or not to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons for such recommendation shall be prepared by the purchasing agent and shall be filed along with other papers relating to the transaction.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § II(K), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-302. - Expediting.

Subdivision III. - Procedures

Sec. 2-321. - In general.
This subdivision outlines the county's purchasing procedure and the forms system designed to complement it. The purchasing procedure outlined in this subdivision is designed to take full advantage of a centralized purchasing system.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(A), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-322. - Purchase requisition.
(a)
The purchase requisition (PR) initiates the procurement cycle. The receipt of a PR with the necessary information and required signature gives the authority for each specific purchase. A purchase order (PO) will not be issued unless authorized by a proper requisition. The PR makes the purchasing agent accountable for filling the needs as stated on the requisition. The signature of the department head is required on all PRs.
(b)
The PR shall be used to:
(1)
Request the purchase of supplies or services, except engineering and other professional services.
(2)
Change or cancel an existing PR.
(3)
Request price and delivery information on possible future requirements.
(c)
The PR will be a single part form available from central supplies. The completed form is to be forwarded to the director of purchasing. The director of purchasing will review the PR for the purpose of ensuring that:
(1)
All required information is provided;
(2)
The price indicated is the best price;
(3)
Budget compliance/variance is known; and
(4)
Contract compliance will be discussed directly with the requisitioner.
The director of purchasing may only recommend approval or disapproval of a PR.

A PR shall include all of the following information:
(1)
Date the PR is prepared.

(8)
If known, one (1) or more suppliers should be recommended. If the requisitioner feels a particular supplier should not be used, such supplies should be stated along with the PR, with a brief explanation.
(9)
The quantity requested should clearly identify measurable units such as pieces, sheets, pounds, gallons, feet, etc.
(10)
Descriptions should be complete and detailed. Specifications should be written so that no guess work is required. If a specification such as color is not important, it should be so stated on the PR. If known, the manufacturer and part number should be shown.
(11)
List the unit price or an estimated unit price.
(12)
The requisitioner should include on, or attached to, the PR, any useful information that will assist in making the best possible buy on the needed supplies or services.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(B), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-323. - Vendor selection.
Vendors will be selected on a competitive basis. Bids, quotations and proposals will be solicited by newspaper advertising, direct mail, requests of prospective suppliers and by telephone, as appropriate. Purchase orders (POs) or contracts will be awarded to the lowest and best responsible vendor. All bids may be rejected if it is in the public's interest to do so. In determining the lowest and best responsible vendor, in addition to price, the following will be considered:
(1)
The ability, capacity and skill of the vendor to perform the contract or provide the material or service required.
(2)
Whether the vendor can perform the contract or provide the material or service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference.
(3)
The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the vendor.
(4)
The quality of performance of previous contracts, orders or services.
(5)
The previous and existing compliance by the vendor with laws and ordinances relating to the contract, order or service.
(6)
The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the vendor to perform the contract, fill the order or provide the service.
(7)
The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplier or contractual services to the particular use required.
(8)
The ability of the vendor to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract.
(9)
The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(C), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-324. - Invitation for bid; request for quotations.
(a)
The invitation for bid (IFB) will include a general description of the items to be purchased; the bid deposit and performance bond required, if any; where bid blanks and specification may be secured; and the time and place for opening bids. The purchasing agent may also solicit sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers by sending them a copy of such notice. Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated in the IFB. A tabulation of bids can be obtained from the purchasing office after the opening of the bids.
(b)
Purchases of less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) will be made in the open market without necessary resort to IFBs or request for quotations (RFQs).
(c)
Purchases of five hundred one dollars ($501.00) to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) must have three (3) bids which may be solicited either by telephone or written at the discretion of the purchasing agent; however, in those instances where the purchasing agent cannot secure at least three (3) bids within a time frame of five (5) working days, then two (2) or less bids shall be considered adequate.
(d)
Purchases of one thousand one dollars ($1,001.00) to two thousand five hundred ($2,500.00) require written bids. Purchases over five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) require written bids and must be approved by the board of commissioners.
(e)
Purchases made from state contracts, with the exception of the purchase of automobiles, require no further bid.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(D), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-325. - Negotiation.
The invitation for bid (IFB) method of formal advertising and, to a lesser extent, the request for quotation (RFQ) method involves the inflexible process of sealed bids, public opening and award to the lowest and best responsible bidder, whereas negotiation usually involves, after receipt of quotations, the process of bargaining with suppliers or offerers proffering the best deal to the county. Notwithstanding county procurement by negotiation, like procurement by formal advertising requires the observation of impartiality toward all offerers. While negotiation procedures are more flexible than advertised procedures, such flexibility demands a greater degree of care to ensure that all competitive offerers are treated equally. Negotiation, as a purchasing technique, shall be used only after authorization by the board of commissioners.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(E), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-326. - Purchase orders.
(a)
The purchase order (PO) is basically a legal contract. It represents a meeting of the minds between buyer and seller. All formal POs will be prepared by the director of purchasing and executed and issued by the purchasing agent. No PO will be issued without a properly processed purchase requisition (PR).
(b)
All purchases, except purchases of less than fifty dollars ($50.00), whether for single or multiple items, will require a PO.
(c)
The PO will be a numbered, three-part form. After the PO is executed, it will be issued as follows:
(1)
White copy. The white copy shall be mailed to the vendor.
(2)
Yellow copy. The yellow copy shall be maintained in the purchasing department.
(3)
Pink copy. The pink copy shall go to the accounting department.

(1)
PO number.

(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(G), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-328. - Charge account purchase.
(a)
The purchasing agent will issue purchase orders (POs) to selected vendors establishing charge accounts. This method of buying is intended to expedite the procurement of frequently needed low dollar value supplies. Blanket POs will have a two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) cumulative limit and no single purchase may be over fifty dollars ($50.00). Department heads will forward to the purchasing agent a list containing the names and signatures of all personnel proposed to be authorized to sign for supplies under such agreements. Any changes to the name/signature list should be made in writing and filed with the purchasing agent.
(b)
When charging supplies, the vendor's invoice must be signed by the authorized county employee receiving the material. Department heads will forward these signed invoices immediately to the director of purchasing. The director of purchasing must have all signed invoices in order to verify the accuracy of the vendor's monthly bills. Invoices signed by unauthorized personnel will not be paid.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(H), 2-3-2000)

The ordering agency shall ultimately be responsible for the receipt, inspection and acceptance of the incoming supplies and equipment. Receiving procedures shall be as follows:
(1)
When any or all items on the purchase order (PO) have been received, inspected and accepted, the delivery receipt shall be signed and forwarded to the director of purchasing.
(2)
When received items are not acceptable, the receiving agency shall forward to the purchasing agent a receiving report with the reason for rejection stated thereon. The purchasing agent will then arrange for the return and replacement of the defective items or take other action as required. In the case of defective supplies, the receiving report will also be used as a rejection report.
(3)
When items that already have been accepted are subsequently found to be defective, the using agency shall notify the purchasing agent in writing. The following information, when known, is required:
a.
Name of supplier.
b.
PO number item was purchased on.
c.
Date defective item was received.
d.
Nature of defect.
e.
Action requested (return for credit, for replacement, etc.).
(4)
When items are to be received by or delivered to someone or some place other than the using agency, the procedures set forth in subsections (1)—(3) of this section shall be modified only to the extent that:
a.
Someone other than a using agency employee may sign the delivery receipt, but he/she must notify the using agency of receipt of the order.
b.
Someone shall check the condition of the items and check the items delivered against the matching copy of the PO.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(J), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-331. - Payments.
Most vendors offer a cash discount if their invoices are paid promptly. To take advantage of this discount policy and maintain good vendor relations, it is important that all invoices, packing slips and receiving reports be promptly forwarded to the director of purchasing. These documents should reach the director of purchasing within one (1) working day after their receipt by the using agencies.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(K), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-332. - Change orders.
(a)
Using agencies wishing to change or cancel an existing purchase requisition (PR) or purchase order (PO) shall issue a PR requesting such change or cancellation. The changed PR will require the same signatures as required on the original PR. The original PR number shall always be referred to and the action requested shall be clearly stated.
(b)
Upon receipt of a properly signed and processed change request PR, the purchasing agent will issue a change order or change the original PR, as required. When a change or cancellation is decided upon, the purchasing agent should be notified immediately. A few hours' advance notice to the purchasing agent could save the county costly restocking or cancellation charges.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(L), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-333. - Vendor's catalog file.
The purchasing agent will maintain a vendor's catalog file. Catalogs in this file will be available to all interested county employees.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(M), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-334. - Sale of personal property.
Only property declared surplus and obsolete to the needs of the county will be offered for sale.

Surplus supplies will be sold on a competitive basis to the highest bidder.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(N), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-335. - Maintenance contracts.

A copy of maintenance contracts will be on file in the county clerk's office.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(O), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-336. - Maintenance garage.

(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(P), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-337. - Storeroom.
(a)
The purchasing agent will establish and control a central storeroom for selected items such as office supplies, janitorial supplies, etc. This system will enable the purchasing agent to buy storeroom items in large quantities at a considerable cost savings as compared to buying such items as normally required. The storeroom method will also allow the county to standardize frequently used supplies.
(b)
When a using agency needs any item that falls in the storeroom category, such agency will prepare a purchase requisition (PR) and present it to the purchasing agent for filing. If the requested item is not in stock, the purchasing agent will buy it, using the PR as authority to purchase. Requisitioned storeroom items will be charged to the appropriate departments at the end of each month.
(Ord. No. O-11-12-99, § III(Q), 2-3-2000)
Sec. 2-338. - Suggestions.
Suggestions that will help reduce costs, promote efficiency or improve supplier services are both welcome and requested. Cost reduction ideas should reduce costs without a corresponding reduction in quality of service.
