The customer is responsible to pay for the water lost at the regular rate as shown on their water bill. No discounts or other price reduction adjustments can be made.
b.
The customer must present receipts or other evidence to show that repairs have been made to the broken underground water line soon after the break was discovered.
c.
The Mayor may authorize the Clerk to set up an installment payment schedule agreeable to both parties which will allow a residential or business customer up to three months to pay for excess water usage resulting from the break. A residential customer of 62 years of age or over will be permitted, if necessary, to take up to six months to pay. Such agreement must be in writing and kept on file until the final payment has been received.
d.
No interest will be charged on such installment/payments. Payments must begin with the next bill following the signing of the agreement. During the months that installment payments are permitted, the customer must pay all current water charges as they are incurred.
e.
The Mayor can authorize the Clerk to make adjustments in the excess charges for sewage resulting from the break. Those charges can be reduced to an amount equal to the average charge for sewage for three months prior to the discovery of the break.
f.
These procedures will not apply in cases where excessive water usage is the result of a break in any above ground water pipes in a dwelling or building, whether occupied or vacant. The Mayor is not obligated to authorize installment payments to any customers who have had higher water bills due to underground water line breaks for several months who have made no effort to have such breaks promptly repaired.

(Ord. No. 111220-12, exh. A(70-103), 12-20-2011)
Sec. 32-181. - Drought contingency plan.
(a)
A voluntary water restriction will be placed on all customers when the flow rate of the Barber Creek Reservoir No. 6 intake or outfall drops to a level of 0.7 cubic feet per second or when plant production reaches 0.6 million gallons per day average. This restriction will ask residents to voluntarily restrict outdoor use. Residents with odd-numbered addresses are asked to wash their vehicles or water their lawns or gardens on odd-numbered days only. Residents with even-numbered addresses are asked to wash their vehicles or water their lawns or gardens on even-numbered days only.
(b)
This plan will ask residents to defer all discretionary water use until after 7:00 p.m. In addition to reducing demand during peak hours, outdoor activities using water becomes more effective after the sun goes down. Up to 30 percent of water used by sprinkler systems during mid-day heat is lost to evaporation. Water use shifted to evening hours saves water and energy.
(c)
A mandatory water restriction will be placed on all customers when the flow rate of the Barber Creek Reservoir No. 6 intake or outfall drops to a level of 0.6 cubic feet per second or when plant production reaches 0.7 million gallons per day average. These requirements will become mandatory.
(d)
A total ban on outside use will be implemented and enforced when the flow water of the Barber Creek Reservoir No. 6 drops to a level of 0.5 cubic feet per second or when plant production reaches 0.8 million gallons per day average. This will include closing of commercial car washes and restricting water use to all swimming pools, and nonessential use customers.
(e)
The main discharge valve from the elevated water tank located on Fieldcrest Drive will be partially closed when the flow rate of the Barber Creek Reservoir No. 6 intake or outfall drops to a level of 0.5 cubic feet per second or when the plant production rate exceeds 0.8 million gallons per day average. This will reduce flow to the customers but allow water to be maintained in the tank for fire protection.
(1)
Natural disaster. If a natural disaster occurs an emergency crew will be dispatched to the disaster location to assess the situation and make emergency repairs as needed. Operational personnel will be at the plant to ensure water is available for firefighting in the affected areas.
(2)
Power failures. A generator large enough to run the water plant and raw water pump station should be made available in case of prolonged power outages.
(Code 2001, § 38-107; Code 2006, § 70-30)
Sec. 32-182. - Water conservation plan.

Up to 30 percent of water used by sprinkler systems during mid-day heat is lost to evaporation. Water use shifted to evening hours save water and energy.
(c)
A mandatory restriction will be placed on all residents when the water use reaches 80 percent [0.8 mg/day] of plant capacity or withdrawal permit. These requirements will be the same as listed in Subsection (a) of this section but will become mandatory with strict enforcement.
(d)
When water use reaches 90 percent [0.9 mg/day] of plant capacity or withdrawal permit a total ban on outside use will be implemented and enforced. This will include closing of commercial car washes and restricting water use to all swimming pools.
(e)
When or if the water use reaches 0.95 mg/day of plant capacity or withdrawal permit, the main discharge valve from the elevated water tank located on Fieldcrest Drive will be partially closed. This will reduce flow to the customers but allow water to be maintained in the tank for fire protection.
