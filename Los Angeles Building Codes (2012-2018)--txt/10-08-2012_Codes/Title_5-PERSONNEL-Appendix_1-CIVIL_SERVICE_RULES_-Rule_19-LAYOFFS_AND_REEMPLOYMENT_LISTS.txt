(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
19.03 - Order of layoff.
In case there are two or more permanent employees in the class from which layoff or reduction is to be made:
A.
Employees in nonsupervisory classes and supervisory classes in bargaining units as certified by ERCOM shall be laid off or reduced on the basis of inverse order of seniority in county service, except that all employees having a performance evaluation of "improvement needed" on record for at least 30 days shall be laid off first;
B.
Employees in all other supervisory and all managerial classes (except managerial classes in the Sheriff) shall be laid off or reduced on the basis of inverse order of seniority in grade, except that all employees having a performance evaluation of "improvement needed" on record for at least 30 days shall be laid off first.

Management appraisal and performance plan tier I participants holding positions in the classified service and tier II participants shall be laid off or reduced by department according to the participant's class and last performance rating in the following order: "Failed to Meet Expectations," "Needs Improvement Meeting Expectations," "Met Expectations," "Exceeded Expectations," "Far Exceeded Expectations." In case of a tie affecting two or more persons in the same rating category, layoff or reduction shall be according to seniority in the range. In the case of a tie affecting two or more persons with the same seniority, the order of layoff or reduction shall be at the discretion of the appointing power.
(Ord. 2007-0061 § 2 (part), 2007; § 3, Board of Supervisors Amendment adopted 10/10/96: § 3, Board of Supervisors Amendment adopted 9/29/88; Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
19.04 - Ties in performance rating and seniority.

In case of a tie affecting two or more persons in the same category in Rule 19.03(B) who have the same seniority in grade, layoffs will be made according to the following order—competent, very good, outstanding.
B.
If a tie still exists for persons in the same category in Rule 19.03(A) and the persons were appointed from the same eligible list to the class from which the layoff is to be made, the person whose name was in the lower group on said eligible list shall be laid off first. If a tie still exists for persons in the same category in Rule 19.03(B), the person with the least county seniority will be laid off or reduced first.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
19.05 - Exception to order of layoff or reduction.
A.
Where the appointing power deems it to be for the best interest of the service, the appointing power may retain an employee despite the order of the layoff provided in Rule 19.03
B.
The "best interest of the service" may be defined on the basis of such considerations as:
1.
Special qualifications possessed by only the employee(s) retained, important to performance of the department's work;
2.
Loss of the employee's skills on a particular assignment would adversely affect public welfare;
3.
An employee's distinctly superior documented work performance.
C.
The appointing power shall submit written justification for such retention to the director of personnel and obtain the latter's concurrence.
D.
Where the appointing power deems it to be in the best interests of the service, the appointing power may combine, with the concurrence of the director of personnel classes of the same grade into a single group for the purpose of layoff or reduction.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
19.06 - Reduction.
A.
The appointing power may (except as provided in Rule 19.07), if the appointing power deems it for the best interests of the service, make reductions in lieu of layoff to positions at lower levels in the same or related series or positions in other series, for which the employee to be reduced has demonstrated that such employee possesses the skills and aptitudes required in the position to which the employee is to be reduced, thereby causing layoffs only in the lower ranks. Such reductions shall be made in the same order and subject to the same restrictions as provided for under Rules 19.02 and 19.03. Any employee reduced in accordance with the Rule or Rule 19.07 shall not be subject to layoff or further reduction in lieu of layoff from a nonrepresented class to which he/she has been reduced; except when the number of employees who have been or who are being reduced in lieu of layoff to a given class of positions exceeds the number of positions to be utilized in that class in a department, then the right to protection from layoff or further reduction will be afforded as follows:
B.
First, employees who at any time have been or are being reduced in lieu of layoff from a higher-grade position shall have precedence over those who have been or are being reduced from a lower-grade position;
C.
Second, among employees reduced in lieu of layoff from positions of the same grade, precedence shall be determined on the basis of seniority in that grade.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
19.07 - Voluntary reductions in lieu of layoff.
A.
An employee with restoration rights to a lower grade who anticipates being laid off or being reduced in lieu of layoff pursuant to these Rules, or who is so laid off or reduced; may, no later than 15 business days after notice of such layoff, request a reduction in grade and restoration to the employee's last prior lower-grade position held on a permanent basis. Any employee with restoration rights to a class which has been eliminated through the classification/budgetary process shall have restoration rights to the most nearly similar lower-level position in the department. On receiving such a request, the appointing power must make such restoration, thus causing layoffs or reductions only in the lower ranks.
B.
When the number of employees who request reduction and restoration to positions in a given class and department exceeds the number of positions in that class and department, employees who cannot be reduced to the position to which they have the right to request restoration shall have the right to be reduced to the position next previously held on a permanent basis, and so on to the lowest-level position previously held.
C.
An employee whose position must be eliminated or vacated for the reasons cited in Rule 19.01 and who requests a voluntary reduction in accordance with Rule 18.08 rather than cause some less-senior employee to be laid off or reduced, is entitled to have his/her name placed on a reemployment list in accordance with Rule 19.08. Such requests for voluntary demotions are subject to the approval of the appointing power and director of personnel.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
19.08 - Reemployment list.
A.
The names of persons laid off or reduced in accordance with these Rules shall be entered upon a list in the inverse of the order specified in Rules 19.03, 19.04, and 19.06, except that persons whose records of employment have not been satisfactory or who have refused the offer of a position which is paid less than 25 percent below the position from which the employee was laid off or reduced, shall be omitted from the reemployment list. Lists from different departments or at different times for the same class of position shall be combined into a single list. Such list shall be used by every appointing power when a vacancy arises in the same or lower class of position, before certification is made from an eligible list. When a vacancy occurs, the appointing power shall appoint the person highest on the reemployment list who is available and who was laid off from the department in which the appointment is to be made. If no person on the reemployment list was laid off from the department in which the appointment is to be made, the appointing power shall appoint anyone named on such list. If only two names are on the list, the appointing power shall appoint one of such persons; if only one, the appointing power shall appoint that one.
B.
Upon request of the appointing power, the director of personnel may make a selective certification for a particular qualification from a reemployment list, where it is shown that the duties of the position to be filled requires such qualification.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
19.09 - Names dropped.
Names of persons laid off or reduced in lieu of layoff shall be carried on a reemployment list for one year, except that the names of persons appointed to permanent positions of the same level as that from which laid off shall, upon such appointment, be dropped from the list. Persons reduced or reemployed in a lower class or reemployed on a temporary basis shall be continued on the list for the higher position for one year.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
19.10 - Restoration to reemployment list.
The name of any person who has been appointed to a permanent position from a reemployment list and who is separated from the service without delinquency or fault may, at the discretion of the director of personnel, be restored to the reemployment list. This restoration, however, shall not have the effect of extending the time the employee may be carried on the reemployment list beyond one year from date of original separation.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
