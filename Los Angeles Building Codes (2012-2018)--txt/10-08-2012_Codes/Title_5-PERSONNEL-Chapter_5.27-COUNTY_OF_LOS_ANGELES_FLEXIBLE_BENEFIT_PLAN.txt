Nonelective Contributions shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was completed. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, an advance of approximately one-half the monthly Nonelective Contributions received as additional Eligible Earnings in accordance with Section 5.27.050E shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month in which the requisite pay status was completed and the remainder of such additional Eligible Earnings shall be reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the requisite pay status was completed.
B.
Elective Contributions. Each Eligible Employee prior to commencing his participation in the Plan and each Participant prior to the beginning of a Plan Year may irrevocably elect to have an additional dollar amount contributed by the County during a Plan Year for each month that he participates in the Plan as an Elective Contribution, not to exceed his Eligible Earnings for such month, and to have his Eligible Earnings reduced each month by an amount equal to such Elective Contribution; provided, however, that no Elective Contribution shall be contributed for any Participant if he has not been in a pay status for at least eight hours during the prior month. Such Elective Contribution on behalf of a Participant each month shall equal the amount necessary to fund the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits chosen by such Participant pursuant to the election procedure set forth in Section 5.27.060, after first applying the Nonelective Contribution for such month to the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. In the event of contractual renegotiation, change in method of funding, or substitution of a Taxable Benefit and/or Nontaxable Benefit during a Plan Year, the County, without prior notice to Participants, may automatically adjust the Elective Contributions made for, and/or the Eligible Earnings paid to, Participants who have selected such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, in accordance with increases or decreases in the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, monthly Elective Contributions shall be apportioned over semi-monthly pay periods so that approximately one-half the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings as reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the thirtieth day of the month to which the Eligible Earnings relate and the remainder of the monthly Elective Contributions shall be deducted from the Participant's Eligible Earnings reflected in County payroll warrants issued on or about the fifteenth day of the following month.

The cost of a Taxable Benefit shall be treated as being paid to the Participant as cash and then deducted from his earnings and contributed to the Plan on an after-tax basis in an amount equal to the cost of that Taxable Benefit as determined pursuant to Section 5.27.050 D. Eligibility to receive or waive any particular Taxable Benefit by a Participant shall require satisfaction of all waiting periods, eligibility rules, election requirements and other requirements and conditions which are set forth in the Election Information or the Materials and which are applicable to him and his employment and relate to such Taxable Benefit.

The County shall notify Participants in writing prior to the commencement of a Plan Year as to any (a) Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit deletions or additions under the Plan; (b) changes in the amount of Contributions required in payment of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit or changes in the method of funding or payment of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit to the extent such changes are known prior to the commencement of a Plan Year; and (c) modifications in the terms and provisions of any Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit.
D.
Benefit Cost Determination. The CAO shall determine the cost, in dollars, to be charged to a Participant to receive a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. In determining the cost of a particular Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for each Plan Year, the CAO shall consider such factors as it determines to be appropriate, including but not limited to, the cost of purchasing insurance, if applicable, to provide such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit or the out-of-pocket expenses likely to be incurred by the County to provide the same, together with an appropriate amount of administrative expenses incurred in providing such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. The cost of receiving a particular Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit available in the Plan Year may vary among different classes of Participants who are similarly situated with respect to such factors as number of dependents, age, salary level and length of service and may be increased or decreased during a Plan Year pursuant to the renegotiation of the group insurance contract providing such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, the substitution of a comparable Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit, or a change in the method of funding such Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit. Such costs shall be disclosed to Eligible Employees and Participants in writing prior to or contemporaneously with the distribution of election forms for the Plan Year as provided by Section 5.27.060 A and any increase or decrease during the Plan Year in the cost of a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit shall be disclosed to Participants as soon as reasonably possible.
E.

2.
Except as provided in subsection E3 of this section, in the case of an employee who is either a participant under the provisions of Subdivision 2 of this Chapter 5.27 on December 31, 1994, or who, as of that date, is eligible to become a participant under said Subdivision 2, and who elects to be covered by the provisions of this Subdivision 1 beginning on or after January 1, 1995, the total cash benefit shall not exceed the Nonelective Contribution to which said Participant would have been entitled based on his Compensation as of December 31, 1994 if he had been a Participant under this Subdivision 1 on that date.
3.
The limits on taxable cash set forth in subsections E1 and 2 of this section shall not apply to any Participant who has waived all rights to have taxable cash in excess of such limits included in his "compensation" and "compensation earnable" within the meaning of Sections 31460 and 31461 of the California Government Code. Such waiver shall be made in writing pursuant to Section 31461.4 of the California Government Code. A waiver executed on or before the fifteenth day of a month shall take effect on the first day of that month. A waiver executed after the fifteenth day of a month, but prior to the end of the month shall take effect on the first day of the following month. The provisions of this subsection E3 shall only affect taxable cash earned after the effective date of the waiver described herein. Said waiver shall not be "executed" within the meaning of this subsection until it is received by the County officer, employee, or agent designated by the CAO.

Each Eligible Employee prior to commencing his participation in the Plan and each Participant prior to the beginning of a Plan Year shall elect the types of Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits to be received under the Plan during the course of such Plan Year. The form and content of the election form shall be such as the County shall from time to time determine to be appropriate. All election forms shall be due and returnable to the County on or before such date as the County may specify, which date shall be no later than the day prior to the commencement of the Plan Year to which such forms relate, or in the case of Eligible Employees the day prior to the commencement of participation.
B.
Deemed Elections. Any Eligible Employee who is enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program incorporated into the Plan as a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit on the date his election form is due to be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section, or any Participant who in the current Plan Year receives one or more Taxable Benefits or Nontaxable Benefits who fails to make a timely election of Benefits for either initial participation or continued participation in the Plan, whichever is relevant, shall be deemed to have elected to receive the same type, and if applicable, the same amount, of Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits elected for the period preceding Plan participation or for the previous Plan Year except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the dollar value of the Nonelective Contribution made on behalf of such Participant exceeds the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, the Participant shall receive the difference in additional monthly Eligible Earnings during the Plan Year except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits exceeds the Nonelective Contributions, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as may be necessary to cover the excess cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.27.040B. Any Eligible Employee or Participant who fails to submit the election form on or before the due date who was not so enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program shall be deemed to have elected to receive the entire amount of the Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf during the next Plan Year as additions to his Eligible Earnings each month during such Plan Year, except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented: 1) any additional monthly Eligible Earnings received due to a Participant's deemed election under this Section 5.27.060B shall be reflected in County payroll warrants as described in Section 5.27.040A, and 2) a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.27.040B.

In the event of an extraordinary change in a Participant's circumstances, and in accordance with any applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 125 of the Code, the County, in its sole discretion, may permit such Participant during the Plan Year to change the type and/or amount of Benefits to be received under the Plan for the remainder of such Plan Year.
E.
Compensation Reduction Agreement. If, in respect of any month during a Plan Year, the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits elected by a Participant for such Plan Year exceeds the amount of Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf for such month, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.27.040B hereof, to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as is necessary to cover the excess cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits elected by such Participant and to make corresponding Elective Contributions to the Plan on his behalf. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.27.040B.
F.
Participant Accounts. The County shall establish and maintain appropriate procedures and records with respect to Benefit elections and Contributions made by and on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section. The County may establish one or more accounts for each Participant for the purpose of recording such Participant's utilization of particular Nontaxable Benefits, such as uninsured health care or dependent care reimbursement benefits if available, to which specific dollar amounts of Nonelective and/or Elective Contributions have been credited. In no event, however, shall such accounts represent actual deposits of Contributions into any fund, nor shall any interest be credited with respect to such accounts.
G.
Forfeiture of Unused Benefits. Any amount which a Participant has elected to receive during the Plan Year as a specific Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit pursuant to the election procedure set forth in subsections A and B of this section which remains unused by the Participant at the close of the Plan Year shall be forfeited to the County; provided, however, that payments of such amount may be made to the Participant up to six months beyond the close of a Plan Year so long as such payments are made under the provisions of such specific Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for expenses incurred by the Participant during the Plan Year.

Prior to the commencement of each Plan Year, or in the case of employees who become Eligible Employees during a Plan Year, prior to the first day of their participation in the Plan pursuant to Section 5.27.230A, the County shall provide an election form to each Eligible Employee and Participant who will be entitled to begin or continue participation in the Plan for such Plan Year. Each Eligible Employee prior to commencing his participation in the Plan and each Participant prior to the beginning of a Plan Year shall elect the types of Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits to be received under the Plan during the course of such Plan Year. The form and content of the election form shall be such as the County shall from time to time determine to be appropriate. All election forms shall be due and returnable to the County on or before such date as the County may specify, which date shall be no later than the day prior to the commencement of the Plan Year to which such forms relate, or in the case of Eligible Employees the day prior to the commencement of participation.
B.
Deemed Elections. Any Eligible Employee who is enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program incorporated into the Plan as a Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit on the date his election form is due to be filed pursuant to subsection A of this section, or any Participant who in the current Plan Year receives one or more Taxable Benefits or Nontaxable Benefits who fails to make a timely election of Benefits for either initial participation or continued participation in the Plan, whichever is relevant, shall be deemed to have elected to receive the same type, and if applicable, the same amount, of Taxable Benefits and Nontaxable Benefits elected for the period preceding Plan participation or for the previous Plan Year, except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the dollar value of the Nonelective Contribution made on behalf of such Participant exceeds the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, the Participant shall receive the difference in additional monthly Eligible Earnings during the Plan Year except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. To the extent that the cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits exceeds the Nonelective Contributions, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as may be necessary to cover the excess cost of such Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.27.240B. Any Eligible Employee or Participant who fails to submit the election form on or before the due date who was not so enrolled in an insured health or welfare benefit program shall be deemed to have elected to receive the entire amount of the Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf during the next Plan Year as additions to his Eligible Earnings each month during such Plan Year, except as otherwise provided in the Election Information. Effective beginning on or after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented: 1) any additional monthly Eligible Earnings received due to a Participant's deemed election under this Section 5.27.260B shall be reflected in County payroll warrants as described in Section 5.27.240A, and 2) a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.27.240B.
C.
Irrevocability of Elections. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, all elections made by or on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section shall be irrevocable for the Plan Year for which made or deemed to be made.
D.
Election Changes During the Plan Year. In the event of an extraordinary change in a Participant's circumstances, and in accordance with any applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 125 of the Code, the County, in its sole discretion, may permit such Participant during the Plan Year to change the type and/or amount of Benefits to be received under the Plan for the remainder of such Plan Year.
E.
Compensation Reduction Agreement. If, in respect of any month during a Plan Year, the cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits elected by a Participant for such Plan Year exceeds the amount of Nonelective Contributions made on his behalf for such month, the Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the County, in accordance with the limit set forth in Section 5.27.040B hereof, to reduce his Eligible Earnings by such amount each month as is necessary to cover the excess cost of the Taxable Benefits and/or Nontaxable Benefits elected by such Participant and to make corresponding Elective Contributions to the Plan on his behalf. Effective beginning on or after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, a Participant's deemed authorization to have his monthly Eligible Earnings reduced shall include an authorization to have such reduction apportioned over County payroll periods and warrants as described in Section 5.27.240B.
F.
Participant Accounts. The County shall establish and maintain appropriate procedures and records with respect to Benefit elections and Contributions made by and on behalf of Participants pursuant to subsections A and B of this section. The County may establish one or more accounts for each Participant for the purpose of recording such Participant's utilization of particular Nontaxable Benefits, such as uninsured health care or dependent care reimbursement benefits if available, to which specific dollar amounts of Nonelective and/or Elective Contributions have been credited. In no event, however, shall such accounts represent actual deposits of Contributions into any fund, nor shall any interest be credited with respect to such accounts.
G.
Forfeiture of Unused Benefits. Any amount which a Participant has elected to receive during the Plan Year as a specific Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit pursuant to the election procedure set forth in subsections A and B of this section which remains unused by the Participant at the close of the Plan Year shall be forfeited to the County; provided, however, that payments of such amount may be made to the Participant up to six months beyond the close of a Plan Year so long as such payments are made under the provisions of such specific Taxable Benefit or Nontaxable Benefit for expenses incurred by the Participants during the Plan Year.

If the Evidence of Disability shows to the satisfaction of the CAO that an Eligible Participant is Totally Disabled, the basic monthly benefit shall become payable effective as of the expiration of the Waiting Period.

If the CAO determines after medical examination that an Eligible Participant is not Totally Disabled, no disability benefits shall be payable.

No Participant shall earn or accrue vacation benefits after January 1, 1991, or the date the Participant commences participation in the Plan, whichever occurs later (hereinafter referred to as the "Vacation Ending Date"). On the Vacation Ending Date, each Participant who is otherwise eligible for vacation benefits, as set forth in Chapter 6.18, shall receive a final crediting of vacation time. Such final crediting shall be calculated as follows:
a.
In any case where the Participant's Vacation Ending Date coincides with his vacation anniversary date, he shall receive a final crediting of vacation time equal to the number of working days of vacation to which he would normally be entitled on said date pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 6.18. b. In any case where the Participant's Vacation Ending Date does not coincide with his vacation anniversary date, he shall receive a final crediting of vacation time equal to the number of working days of vacation to which he would otherwise be entitled if he were terminating County service on his Vacation Ending Date and receiving leaving vacation benefits pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 6.18; provided, however, that no Participant shall receive any such final crediting of vacation time unless he has worked for the County for at least one year in a capacity that would otherwise entitle him to vacation benefits.
2.
All vacation time earned and credited to the books up through and including the Vacation Ending Date shall remain available for use or payoff at termination of County service pursuant to the rules set forth in Chapter 6.18; provided, however, that there shall be no limitations on the accrual and carryover of such time.

No Participant who is a general member of the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association shall be eligible to receive industrial injury leave benefits set forth in Section 6.20.070 of this Code with respect to any industrial injury occurring on or after January 1, 1991.

In the event a Participant is absent due to an industrial injury incurred on or after January 1, 1991, and the absence is charged to Nonelective Annual Leave, Elective Annual Leave, vacation, sick leave, accumulated holiday time or accumulated overtime, and the injury is subsequently determined to be compensable by the Chief Administrative Officer or the Workers Compensation Appeals Board, the Participant shall be entitled to a partial restoration of such time pursuant to the Election Information.

In such case, the Participant shall be deemed to be covered by the provisions of Chapter 5.38, including both disability and survivor benefits, until he returns to work. Further, during such period, such Participant shall be deemed ineligible for benefits under the Long-Term Disability Plan set forth in Part 4 of this Chapter 2. Effective March 1, 1991, no Participant shall be eligible for survivor benefit coverage under Section 5.38.040 except as provided under subsection 1 above.
