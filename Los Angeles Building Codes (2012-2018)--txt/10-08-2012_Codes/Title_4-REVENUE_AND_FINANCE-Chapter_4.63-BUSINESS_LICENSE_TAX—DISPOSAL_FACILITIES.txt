4.63.150 - Assessment—Administrative remedy.
A.
1. Whenever the tax administrator determines that any tax is due or may be due to the county under the provisions of this chapter, he may make and give notice of an assessment of such tax.
2.
The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of any tax known by the tax administrator to be due or estimated by the tax administrator, after full consideration of all information within his knowledge concerning the business and activities of the operator assessed, to be due under each applicable section of this chapter and shall include the amount of any penalties or interest accrued on each amount to the date of notice of assessment.
B.
The notice of assessment shall be served upon the operator either by handing it to him personally, or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the operator at the address of the location of the business appearing on the face of the registration certificate issued to him or to such other address as he shall register with the tax administrator for the purpose of receiving notices provided under this chapter; should the operator have no registration certificate issued to him and should he have no address registered with the tax administrator for such purpose, then to such operator's last known address. For the purpose of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail. Within 15 days after the date of service, the operator assessed may either apply in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the assessment or may file a written request that such hearing be waived. If the operator neither requests a hearing upon the assessment nor requests a waiver of hearing within the prescribed time, the amount of the assessment shall be final and the amount thereof shall immediately be due and owing to the county, but penalties and interest as provided by this chapter shall continue to accrue until paid.
C.
If the operator requests that the hearing be waived, the tax administrator may either grant such request and notify the operator thereof in writing or may, in his discretion, deny the request and set the assessment for hearing at the time and in the manner prescribed by subsection D hereof. If the tax administrator grants the request for waiver of hearing, the administrative proceedings prescribed by this section shall be deemed exhausted and the county shall have the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount of the assessment, plus such penalties and interest as may have accrued thereon as provided by this chapter.
D.
If the operator requests a hearing upon the assessment, or if the tax administrator denies his request for a waiver of hearing, the tax administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before the business license commission not later than 90 days after the date of the application, or as the case may be, the date of the tax administrator's denial of the request for waiver of hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed to the operator assessed not later than 15 days before the date set for hearing and, if the tax administrator desires such operator to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records required to be produced.
E.
The hearing prescribed by this section shall be before the business license commission. At the hearing the operator assessed and the tax administrator, may submit such evidence as they believe to be relevant to their respective positions. The business license commission may require the presentation of additional evidence from either the operator assessed or from the tax administrator, or from both, and may continue that hearing from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence.
F.
Decision of the Board of Review. Upon completion of the hearing, the business license commission may (1) affirm the assessment, (2) increase the assessment, or (3) decrease the assessment, as the evidence may require; but the amount of the assessment shall not be increased unless the claim for the increase is asserted on behalf of the county either before or during the hearing. Written notice of the decision of the business license commission shall be given to the operator assessed in the same form and in the same manner as the notice of assessment.
G.
Within 15 days from the date of service of the notice of decision of the business license commission, the operator assessed may file written exceptions to the decision of the business license commission, but he shall not be required to do so. If he does not do so, he shall nevertheless be deemed to have exhausted the administrative proceedings provided by this section. Upon filing of written exceptions, the business license commission may either deny the exceptions or modify its decision; it shall cause a written notice of decision as required by subsection F hereof, to be given to the operator assessed at the time, and in the manner provided therein. If the business license commission does not modify its decision within 30 days from the service of said exceptions, the exceptions shall be deemed denied.
H.
Failure of the tax administrator to set any hearing within the time prescribed in this section and failure of the business license commission to complete any procedure prescribed in this section within the period stated shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken hereunder.
I.
Acceptance of any payment upon an assessment, the validity of which has not previously been passed upon by the business license commission, shall not preclude the tax administrator from subsequently levying another assessment in any case where the original assessment does not truly reflect the correct tax liability.
(Ord. 91-0017 § 1 (part), 1991.)
4.63.160 - Confidential character of information obtained—Disclosure unlawful.
It shall be unlawful for the tax administrator or any person having an administrative duty under the provisions of this chapter to make known in any manner whatever the business affairs, operations, or information obtained by an investigation of records and equipment of any person required to obtain a business tax registration certificate, or pay business tax, or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures, or any particular thereof, set forth in any statement or return, or to permit any statement or return, or copy of either, or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person. Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent:
1.
The disclosure of information to, or the examination of records and equipment by, another county official or employee for the sole purpose of administering or enforcing any provision of this chapter;
2.
The disclosure of information to, or the tax officials of another city or county, or city and county, if a reciprocal arrangement exists; or to a grand jury;
3.
The disclosure of information and results of examination of records of particular taxpayers, or relating to particular taxpayers, to a court of law in a proceeding brought to determine the existence or amount of any business tax liability of the particular taxpayers to the county;
4.
The disclosure, after the filing of a written request to that effect, to the taxpayer himself, or to his successors, receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, of information as to the items included in the measure of any paid tax, any unpaid tax or amounts of tax required to be collected, interest and penalties; further provided, however, that the county counsel approves each such disclosure and that the tax administrator may refuse to make any disclosure referred to in this paragraph when in his opinion the public interest would suffer thereby; and
5.
The disclosure of the names and addresses of persons or operators to whom registration certificates have been issued.
(Ord. 91-0017 § 1 (part), 1991.)
4.63.170 - Severability.
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this chapter or any part thereof. The board of supervisors of the county of Los Angeles hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid.
