Sections:

5.19.001 - Restatement.
This Pension Savings Plan has been amended and restated effective January 1, 1999, to comply with and reflect certain changes made to the Code by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA") and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.
(Ord. 2004-0001 ยง 2 (part), 2004.)
5.19.010 - Purpose.
This Pension Savings Plan is designed to provide for a retirement plan effective January 1, 1992 for certain employees of Los Angeles County who are not eligible to participate in the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association. The Plan is a benefit enhancement provided to employees in lieu of participation in the Social Security System.
While the County intends to continue the Plan, it reserves the right to terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time subject to negotiations with employee representatives. Benefits under the Plan shall at all times be limited to those payable from a Participant's account to the extent funded by County contributions that have been made and credited to such account. Therefore, neither participation in the Plan nor eligibility therefor shall entitle any employee to have the Plan or any of its provisions continued for his benefit in the future.

Each such valuation shall be made on the basis of the net gain or loss to each such Investment Fund between the current Valuation Date and the last preceding Valuation Date. The net gain or loss of an Investment Fund shall include realized and unrealized earnings, interest income, dividends actually paid and other income of such Fund during such period, and shall be reduced by expenses paid, if any, that are to be charged to such Investment Fund in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement. The transfer of funds to or from an Investment Fund, the allocation of Deferred Compensation Contributions, Supplemental Deferred Compensation Contributions and Matching Contributions, and payments, distributions and withdrawals from an Investment Fund to provide benefits under the Plan for Participants or Beneficiaries shall not be deemed to be income, expenses or losses of the Investment Fund. A similar valuation shall be made at any other time the Administrative Committee or its Agent deems it appropriate to make such a valuation.
3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Committee or its Agent may, in accordance with applicable requirements of the Code and California law, (a) adopt, or instruct a Discretionary Trustee to adopt, such accounting procedures as the Administrative Committee or its Agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to establish a proportionate crediting of net gain or loss of an Investment Fund and of Contributions made to an Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date, and (b) adopt, or instruct a Discretionary Trustee to adopt, such other valuation procedures as the Administrative Committee or its Agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to determine the value of the Investment Funds. The reasonable and equitable decision of the Administrative Committee or a Discretionary Trustee, as applicable, as to the value of each Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and Beneficiaries having any interest, direct or indirect, in such Investment Fund.
C.
No Guarantee against Loss. The County, the Administrative Committee and the Trustee do not guarantee in any manner the Investment Funds or any part thereof against loss or depreciation.

If a Participant does not make a timely election regarding the distribution of his benefits after receiving the notice required under Code section 402(f), the Participant will be deemed to have elected to defer distribution of his benefits, with the exception that the Participant's benefits will be distributed in a single cash payment as soon as administratively feasible, without the Participant's consent, if the Participant's Investment Account balance is $1,000.00 or less on the date of distribution. The electing Participant or Beneficiary shall furnish such information as the County or its Agent may require.
2.
Form of Benefit Payment. A Participant who Separates from Employment with the County due to Retirement, or Participant who Separates from Employment earlier but delays distribution of his benefits until at least age 50, may, if his or her Investment Account balance exceeds $5,000.00, in lieu of receiving a single lump sum, irrevocably elect to receive his or her benefits in the form of (1) substantially equal monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installment payments over a period not to exceed twenty years, or (2) consecutive, nonincreasing monthly payments for the life of the Participant or for the lives of the Participant and his or her designated Beneficiary and the last survivor of them. The Participant or the Beneficiary, as the case may be, may only elect a form of benefit payment prior to the commencement of any distribution under the Plan. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in the event that the balance of a Participant's Investment Account does not exceed $5,000.00 at the time a distribution is elected, the Participant or the Beneficiary, as the case may be, may not elect a form of benefit payment other than a single cash payment.
D.
Death.
1.
Before Separation from Employment. In the event of the death of the Participant while he is an Employee, the County shall distribute the entire balance of his Investment Account to his Beneficiary in accordance with Section 5.19.100 C. Subject to the limitations of Section 5.19.100 E, such distribution shall commence not later than the last day of the Plan Year in which the deceased Participant would have attained age 70ยฝ unless payment of benefits has already commenced, in which event such payments shall be continued in accordance with the method of payment previously selected by the Participant.
2.
Following Separation from Employment. In the event of the death of a Participant following his Separation from Employment, the County shall distribute the balance, if any, of his Investment Account to his Beneficiary in accordance with Section 5.19.100 C. Subject to the limitations of Section 5.19.100 E, such distribution shall commence not later than the last day of the Plan Year in which the deceased Participant would have attained age 70ยฝ unless payment of benefits has already commenced, in which event such payments shall be continued in accordance with the method of payment previously selected by the Participant.
3.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if a Beneficiary does not file an election regarding distribution of the Participant's Investment Account balance within 30 days after the Plan Administrator or its Agent provides the Beneficiary with the election materials (including the notice required under Code section 402(f), if applicable), the Investment Account balance shall be distributed in a single cash payment as soon as administratively feasible.

For distributions beginning before the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Participant's Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under subsection E3b. The required minimum distribution for the Participant's first Distribution Calendar Year will be made on or before the Participant's Required Beginning Date. The required minimum distribution for other Distribution Calendar Years, including the required minimum distribution for the Distribution Calendar Year in which the Member's Required Beginning Date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that Distribution Calendar Year.
c.

d.
"Participant's Account Balance": The Investment Account balance as of the last Valuation Date in the calendar year immediately preceding the Distribution Calendar Year (the "Valuation Calendar Year") increased by the amount of any contributions made and allocated or forfeitures allocated to the Investment Account balance as of dates in the Valuation Calendar Year after the Valuation Date and decreased by distributions made in the Valuation Calendar Year after the Valuation Date. The Investment Account balance for the Valuation Calendar Year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the Plan either in the Valuation Calendar Year or in the Distribution Calendar Year if distributed or transferred in the Valuation Calendar Year.
e.
"Required Beginning Date": The applicable date specified in subsection E3 below.
2.
General Rules. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, all distributions required under this Section 5.19.100 will be determined and made in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Code section 401(a)(9). The only permissible distribution options under this Plan are a lump sum distribution, substantially equal monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installments not extending over more than twenty years, consecutive periodic payments for the life of the Participant or for the lives of the Participant and his or her designated Beneficiary and the last survivor of them, as permitted in subsection B or C, or minimum monthly distributions calculated in accordance with the rules provided in this subsection E.
3.
Time of Distribution.
a.
The Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date. Except as described in subsection 3b below, the Required Beginning Date of any Participant shall be the April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (1) the calendar year he terminates employment or (2) the calendar year he attains age 70ยฝ.
b.
If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
(1)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection 3d below is made, distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70ยฝ, if later.
(2)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection 3d below is made, distributions to the Designated Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died.
(3)
If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
(4)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection 3b, other than subsection 3b(1), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
c.
For purposes of this subsection E, unless subsection 3b(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Beginning Date. If subsection 3b(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 3b(1). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant's Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 3b(4)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
d.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant dies before distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, distribution to the Designated Beneficiary is not required to begin by the Required Beginning Date specified above if the Participant or the Beneficiary elects, on an individual basis, that the Participant's entire interest will be distributed to the Designated Beneficiary by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; provided, however, that if the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to either the Participant or the surviving spouse begin, this election will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. The election provided in this subsection 3d must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distribution would be required to begin, or by September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the Participant's (or, if applicable, surviving spouse's) death.
4.
Required Minimum Distributions during Participant's Lifetime.
a.
During the Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of:
(1)
The quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year; or
(2)
If the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant's spouse and the spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year.
b.
Required minimum distributions will be determined under this subsection E4 beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant's date of death.

5.
Required Minimum Distributions If Participant Dies after Distributions Begin.
a.
Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as follows:
(1)
The Participant's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(2)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as of the spouse's birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving spouse's death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.
(3)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated Beneficiary's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
b.
No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary (for example, if pursuant to the Plan, the Beneficiary is the Participant's estate) as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the Participant's remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
c.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations.
6.
Death before Date Distributions Begin.
a.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection E3d above is made, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in subsection E5a above.
b.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
c.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 3b(1), this subsection E will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
d.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the related Treasury Regulations.
F.
Lost Participants. If the Participant or his Beneficiary cannot be located within four years of the date the Participant's interest under the Plan is first payable, the entire balance in his Investment Account shall be forfeited; provided, however, that the amount so forfeited shall be reinstated as of the date of the subsequent filing of an application for benefits under the Plan, and payment of such benefits shall commence no later than 60 days after such application is filed.

The Amount of Participant's Investment Account which is forfeited for a Plan Year in accordance with Section 5.19.100 F shall be placed in a suspense account and applied as soon as possible to restore the accounts of lost Participants who have filed an application for benefits, if any.

If a Participant undergoes a Separation from Employment in order to accept employment with another eligible governmental employer (within the meaning of Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code) which sponsors an "eligible deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 457(b) of the Code, then that Participant may make an election not to have the vested amounts credited to such Participant's Investment Account distributed, but instead to have such amounts transferred to the "eligible deferred compensation plan" of the new employer of such Participant, provided that (a) the transferee plan specifically authorizes the acceptance of such transferred amounts, (b) the Participant's account balance under the transferee plan immediately after the transfer is at least equal to the total amount of the Participant's Investment Account immediately before the transfer, and (c) the Participant is performing services for the eligible governmental employer maintaining the transferee plan.

Such election shall be made on a form provided by the County or its Agent. Following such an election by either the Participant or the Administrative Committee, the investments in the Participant's Investment Account shall be liquidated and then the cash shall be transferred to the other County plan within a commercially reasonable period of time, unless the Administrative Committee otherwise makes arrangements for an in-kind transfer of assets.

Notwithstanding Section 5.19.170, an Alternate Payee shall have the right to make a claim for any benefits awarded to the Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO as provided in this section. If an Alternate Payee is awarded a specified interest in the Investment Account of the Participant pursuant to a QDRO, such interest of the Alternate Payee shall be segregated and separately accounted for by the Trustee in the name and for the benefit of the Alternate Payee.
B.
Upon receipt of a domestic relations order, or, if earlier, written notice that a domestic relations order may be sought, the Administrative Committee shall suspend distributions from the Participant's Investment Account, and shall take steps to ensure that the Participant and each Alternate Payee is aware of the order or proposed order and the suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Account. Moreover, the Administrative Committee shall determine, within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, whether such order is a QDRO. If the order is determined to be a QDRO, the Alternate Payee's interest under such order shall be segregated and/or distributed in accordance with the QDRO and this Section 5.19.175. The suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Account shall be discontinued only in accordance with a QDRO or other documentation as required by the Plan Administrator demonstrating that no benefits have been awarded to the Alternate Payee.
C.
Distributions to the Alternate Payee shall be made in accordance with the QDRO provided that the QDRO does not provide for distributions earlier than permitted by Code section 457(d) or otherwise conflict with the Plan's distribution provisions or the provisions of this section. On or after January 1, 2004, regardless of whether the Participant is eligible to take a distribution under the Plan, the QDRO may provide (or may be amended to provide) for an immediate distribution of the Alternate Payee's interest thereunder to the Alternate Payee. If a QDRO does not provide the form of distribution of benefits payable to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee shall have the right to elect distribution in any form provided under this section. Pursuant to the QDRO or the Alternate Payee's election, the Alternate Payee's interest may be distributed in any form of payment available to the Participant; provided, however, that such payment shall be shall be made in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) and applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
D.
Unless the QDRO provides otherwise, an Alternate Payee shall have the right, in the same manner as a Participant, to designate a Beneficiary, who shall receive benefits payable to the Alternate Payee in the event that all of the Alternate Payee's benefits have not been distributed at the time of the Alternate Payee's death. If the Alternate Payee does not designate a Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary predeceases the Alternate Payee, benefits payable to the Alternate Payee which have not been distributed shall be paid to the Alternate Payee's estate. Any death benefits payable under this section shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the Alternate Payee's death and as soon as permissible in accordance with Code section 457(d), with or without the Beneficiary's request.
