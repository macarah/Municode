Sections:

FOOTNOTE(S):
(147) Editor's note— For statutory provisions on county human relations commissions, see Gov. Code § 50260 et seq.
2.78.010 - Findings of fact—Declaration of policy.
The board of supervisors finds that the injustices and the inequities resulting from prejudice, intolerance and discrimination against any individual or group because of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, or because of any arbitrary factor such as socio-economic status, marital status or personal handicaps, promote tension and conflict and constitute an unconscionable menace to the public welfare; that to eliminate such prejudice and inequity and thereby promote public health, welfare and security, an instrumentality should be established through which practices to achieve better human relations can be provided, and private persons and groups may be officially assisted in promoting good will and better relations among all people.
