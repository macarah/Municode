12.08.020 - Declaration of policy—Nuisances deemed misdemeanors.
A.
In order to control unnecessary, excessive and annoying noise and vibration in the county of Los Angeles, it is declared to be the policy of the county to prohibit such noise and vibration generated from any sources as specified in this chapter. It shall be the policy of the county to maintain quiet in those areas which exhibit low noise levels and to implement programs aimed at reducing noise in those areas within the county where noise levels are above acceptable values.
B.
It is determined that certain noise levels and vibration are detrimental to the public health, welfare and safety and contrary to public interest, and therefore the board of supervisors of the county does ordain and declare that creating, maintaining, causing or allowing to be created, caused or maintained any noise or vibration in a manner prohibited by or not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter is a public nuisance and shall be punishable as such.

12.08.390 - Exterior noise standards—Citations for violations authorized when.
A.
Unless otherwise herein provided, the following exterior noise levels shall apply to all receptor properties within a designated noise zone:
EXPAND
Noise Zone Designated Noise Zone Land Use (Receptor property) Time Interval Exterior Noise Level (dB)
I Noise-sensitive area Anytime 45
II Residential properties 10:00 pm to 7:00 am (nighttime) 45
7:00 am to 10:00 pm (daytime) 50
III Commercial properties 10:00 pm to 7:00 am (nighttime) 55
7:00 am to 10:00 pm (daytime) 60
IV Industrial properties Anytime 70
  B.
Unless otherwise herein provided, no person shall operate or cause to be operated, any source of sound at any location within the unincorporated county, or allow the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by such person which causes the noise level, when measured on any other property either incorporated or unincorporated, to exceed any of the following exterior noise standards:
Standard No. 1 shall be the exterior noise level which may not be exceeded for a cumulative period of more than 30 minutes in any hour. Standard No. 1 shall be the applicable noise level from subsection A of this section; or, if the ambient L50 exceeds the foregoing level, then the ambient L50 becomes the exterior noise level for Standard No. 1.
Standard No. 2 shall be the exterior noise level which may not be exceeded for a cumulative period of more than 15 minutes in any hour. Standard No. 2 shall be the applicable noise level from subsection A of this section plus 5dB; or, if the ambient L25 exceeds the foregoing level, then the ambient L25 becomes the exterior noise level for Standard No. 2.
Standard No. 3 shall be the exterior noise level which may not be exceeded for a cumulative period of more than five minutes in any hour. Standard No. 3 shall be the applicable noise level from subsection A of this section plus 20dB; or, if the ambient L8.3 exceeds the foregoing level, then the ambient L8.3 becomes exterior noise level for Standard No. 3.
Standard No. 4 shall be the exterior noise level which may not be exceeded for a cumulative period of more than one minute in any hour. Standard No. 4 shall be the applicable noise level from subsection A of this section plus 15dB; or, if the ambient L1.7 exceeds the foregoing level, then the ambient L1.7 becomes the exterior noise level for Standard No. 4.
Standard No. 5 shall be the exterior noise level which may not be exceeded for any period of time. Standard No. 5 shall be the applicable noise level from subsection A of this section plus 20dB; or, if the ambient L0 exceeds the foregoing level then the ambient L0 becomes the exterior noise level for Standard No. 5.
C.
If the measurement location is on a boundary property between two different zones, the exterior noise level utilized in subsection B of this section to determine the exterior standard shall be the arithmetic mean of the exterior noise levels in subsection A of the subject zones. Except as provided for above in this subsection C, when an intruding noise source originates on an industrial property and is impacting another noise zone, the applicable exterior noise level as designated in subsection A shall be the daytime exterior noise level for the subject receptor property.
D.
The ambient noise histogram shall be measured at the same location along the property line utilized in subsection B of this section, with the alleged intruding noise source inoperative. If for any reason the alleged intruding noise source cannot be turned off, the ambient noise histogram will be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the alleged intruding noise source but at a sufficient distance such that the noise from the alleged intruding noise source is at least 10dB below the ambient noise histogram in order that only the actual ambient noise histogram be measured. If the difference between the ambient noise histogram and the alleged intruding noise source is 5 to 10dB, then the level of the ambient noise histogram itself can be reasonably determined by subtracting a one-decibel correction to account for the contribution of the alleged intruding noise source.
E.
In the event the intrusive exceeds the exterior noise standards as set forth in subsections B and C of this section at a specific receptor property and the health officer has reason to believe that this violation at said specific receptor property was unanticipated and due to abnormal atmospheric conditions, the health officer shall issue an abatement notice in lieu of a citation. If the specific violation is abated, no citation shall be issued therefor. If, however, the specific violation is not abated, the health officer may issue a citation.
(Ord. 11778 § 2 (Art. 4 § 403), 1978: Ord. 11773 § 2 (Art. 4 § 403), 1978.)
