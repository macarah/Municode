The accusation shall be verified unless made by a public officer acting in his official capacity. The verification may be on information and belief.
(Ord. 2003-0067 § 17, 2003: Ord. 10279 § 7 (part), 1971: Ord. 9431 § 2 (part), 1967: Ord. 5860 Ch. 1 Art. 11 § 135.1, 1951.)

E.
The copy of the accusation shall include or be accompanied by a statement that respondent may request a hearing by filing a notice of defense as provided in this chapter within 10 days after service upon him of the accusation, and that failure to do so will constitute a waiver of his right to a hearing. The commission shall include with the accusation a postcard or other form, entitled "Notice of Defense," which, when signed by or on behalf of the respondent and returned to the commission, will acknowledge service of the accusation and constitute a notice of defense.
(Ord. 10279 § 7 (part), 1971: Ord. 9714 § 6 (part), 1969: Ord. 9431 § 2 (part), 1967: Ord. 5860 Ch. 1 Art. 11 § 135.3, 1951.)

Within 10 days after service upon him of the accusation against an existing license, the respondent may file with the commission one or more notices of defense in which he may:

Request a hearing;

Object to the accusation upon the ground that it does not state acts or omissions upon which the commission may proceed;
3.
Object to the form of the accusation on the ground that it is so indefinite or uncertain that he cannot identify the transaction or prepare his defense;
4.
Admit the accusation in whole or in part.
B.
The respondent shall be entitled to a hearing on the merits if he files a notice of defense within 10 days, and any such notice shall be deemed a specific denial of all parts of the accusation not expressly admitted.

Unless objection is taken as provided in this section, all objections to the form of the accusation shall be deemed waived.
C.
The notice of defense shall be in writing signed by or on behalf of the respondent, and shall state his mailing address. It need not be verified or follow any particular form.
