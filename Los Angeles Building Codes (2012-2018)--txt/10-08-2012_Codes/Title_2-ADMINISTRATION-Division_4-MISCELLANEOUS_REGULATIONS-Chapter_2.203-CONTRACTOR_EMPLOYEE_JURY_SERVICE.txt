Chapter 2.203 - CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE JURY SERVICE
Sections:

2.203.010 - Findings.
The board of supervisors makes the following findings. The county of Los Angeles allows its permanent, full-time employees unlimited jury service at their regular pay. Unfortunately, many businesses do not offer or are reducing or even eliminating compensation to employees who serve on juries. This creates a potential financial hardship for employees who do not receive their pay when called to jury service, and those employees often seek to be excused from having to serve. Although changes in the court rules make it more difficult to excuse a potential juror on grounds of financial hardship, potential jurors continue to be excused on this basis, especially from longer trials. This reduces the number of potential jurors and increases the burden on those employers, such as the county of Los Angeles, who pay their permanent, full-time employees while on juror duty. For these reasons, the county of Los Angeles has determined that it is appropriate to require that the businesses with which the county contracts possess reasonable jury service policies.
