Whenever, because of an unusually high incidence of communicable disease in the community, the director deems it necessary, he may order that each child, before enrolling in a private school, private boarding school, day nursery, day nursery school and children's boarding home, be inspected for signs of communicable disease. Such inspections shall be made by and certified to, in writing, within 24 hours of enrollment, by a physician in good professional standing or by the director, and must reveal that such child showed no signs of communicable disease which would cause the child's association with other children to be in any way detrimental to their health.
B.
Every child, upon returning after an illness of more than three days to a private school, private boarding school, day nursery, day nursery school or children's boarding home, shall present a certificate, signed by a physician in good professional standing or, other practitioner authorized or permitted by law to practice in this state, or by the director, stating that personal inspection of said child within 24 hours immediately preceding had revealed no signs of a communicable disease which would cause the child's association with other children to be in any way detrimental to their health. Daily, on admission, each child shall be inspected for suspicious signs of communicable disease, and if a child is under six years of age, such inspection shall be made before the child mingles with others. It shall be the duty of the principal, or other person in charge of any of the institutions referred to in this section, immediately to isolate any child or other person affected with an illness presumably communicable, and immediately make arrangements for his care in isolation quarters or exclusion from the institutions as required by the director. Whenever required by Section 120250 of the Health and Safety Code, the department of public health shall be notified that such child has been isolated or excluded, pending presentation of a readmission certificate. If the attending physician, school physician, or the director finds, upon examination, that the child is not suffering from a communicable disease, he may submit a certificate to this effect to the school authority, who shall readmit the person. (Section 2526, Title 17, California Code of Regulations.)
C.
If upon examination the child is found to be suffering from a communicable disease which, according to State Health Department regulations is subject to strict isolation or quarantine of contacts, Section 120545 of the California Health and Safety Code shall apply. "No instructor, pupil or child who resides where any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease exists or has recently existed, which is subject to strict isolation or quarantine of contacts, shall be permitted by any superintendent, principal, or teacher of any college seminary or public or private school to attend the college, seminary, or school, except by the written permission of the Health Officer." If upon examination the child is found to be suffering from a communicable disease other than one requiring strict isolation or quarantine, the readmission certificate or permit may be signed by the attending physician, school physician or director of public health.
