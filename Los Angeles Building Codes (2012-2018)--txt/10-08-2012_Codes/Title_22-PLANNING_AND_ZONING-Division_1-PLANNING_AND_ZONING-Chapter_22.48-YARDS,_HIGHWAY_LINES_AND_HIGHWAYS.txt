(Ord. 1454 Ch. 4 Art. 2 § 452.2, 1927.)
22.48.050 - Flag lots.
Front, side and rear yards required by this Title 22 shall be established on the main portion of a flag lot exclusive of the access strip; provided, however, that in lieu of such yards, a uniform distance of 10 feet from all lot lines may be substituted. In addition, the access strip shall be maintained clear except for driveways, landscaping, fences or walls, which shall be subject to the same requirements specified for yards on adjoining properties fronting on the same parkway, highway or street.
(Ord. 1497 Ch. 4 Art. 2 § 452.3, 1927.)
22.48.060 - Front yards—On partially developed blocks.
Where some lots or parcels of land in a block are improved or partially improved with buildings, each lot or parcel of land in said block may have a front yard of not less than the average depth of the front yards of the land adjoining on either side. A vacant lot or parcel of land, or a lot or parcel of land having more than the front yard required in the zone, shall be considered for this purpose as having a front yard of the required depth.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 4 Art. 2 § 452.4, 1927.)
22.48.070 - Front yards—On key lots.
The depth of a required front yard on key lots or parcels of land shall not be less than the average depth of the required front yard of the adjoining interior lot or parcel of land and the required side yard of the adjoining reversed corner lot or parcel of land.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 4 Art. 2 § 452.5, 1927.)
22.48.080 - Front yards—On sloping terrain.
The required front yard of a lot or parcel of land need not exceed 50 percent of the depth required in a zone where the difference in elevation between the curb level and the natural ground at a point 50 feet from the highway line, measured midway between the side lot lines, is 10 feet or more; or, if there is no curb, where a slope exists of 20 percent or more from the highway line to a point on natural ground 50 feet from said highway line. Measurement in all cases shall be made from a point midway between the side lot lines.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 4 Art. 2 § 452.6, 1927.)
22.48.090 - Side yards on reversed corner lots adjoining key lots.
Where the front yard of a key lot adjoining a reversed corner lot is less than 10 feet in depth, such reversed corner lot may have a corner side yard of the same depth but not less than five feet.

B.
A person shall not use any building or structure within this supplemental yard except for openwork railings or fences which do not exceed six feet in height and except as permitted within a yard by subsections A and D of Section 22.48.150
C.
The supplemental yard requirement established by this section may be modified only by the director of planning pursuant to Part 12 of Chapter 22.56 where topographic features, subdivision plans or other conditions create an unnecessary hardship or unreasonable regulation or make it obviously impractical to require compliance with this requirement. The director shall request a recommendation from the road commissioner prior to modifying the supplemental yard requirement contained in this section.
