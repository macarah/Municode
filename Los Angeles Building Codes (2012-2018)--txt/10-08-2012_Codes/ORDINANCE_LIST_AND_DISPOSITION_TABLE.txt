ORDINANCE LIST AND DISPOSITION TABLE
PUBLISHER'S NOTE
Los Angeles County has been adopting ordinances for many years. Three series of ordinances exist: one set numbered 1—165, a second set, numbered consecutively from No. 1 through 12433, and a third series, beginning with 81-0001, and keyed to the year of passage.
Ordinance 4978, in 1947, streamlined the citation of all these ordinances by designing Ordinances 1—165 as "Old Series" (O.S.). The second group of ordinances, of which Nos. 1—4977 had already been passed with a "New Series" designation, was amended to delete the words "New Series," "in order to eliminate the continual repetition of the words 'New Series' and the letters 'N.S.' so that current ordinances may be referred to by number only without other designation."
In this volume, all Los Angeles County ordinances are listed chronologically. The number of the ordinance is shown, its contents are described briefly, and its disposition (location within the code) is given in parentheses following the description.
If numbers appear in the disposition, provisions of that ordinance will be found in the Los Angeles County Code in that particular chapter, or in footnotes or appendices to that chapter or title. Ordinances marked "(Special)" or "(Not codified)" do not appear in the code volumes buy may still be in effect. Ordinances marked "(Repealed by _____)" have either been specifically cited for repeal in the ordinance named, or are amendments to ordinances which have been specifically repealed.
