325.2.2 - Extra Hazard.
The governing body finds that in many cases because of extra hazardous situations, a firebreak around buildings, structures, or apiaries of only 30 feet (9.14 m) is not sufficient and that a firebreak of 50 feet (15.24 m) or more may be necessary. If the fire code official or commissioner finds that because of the location of any building, structure, or apiary and because of other conditions, a 30-foot (9.14-m) firebreak around such building, structure, or apiary as required by Section 325.2.1 is not sufficient, the fire code official or commissioner may notify all owners of the properties affected that they must clear all flammable vegetation and other combustible growth or reduce the amount of fuel content for a distance greater than 30 feet (9.14 m), but not to exceed 200 feet (60.96 m).
