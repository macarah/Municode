Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the Director, Fire Chief, or ocean lifeguard may designate certain areas to be used exclusively by persons using sailboards, kite boards, surfboards, or paddleboards.

(Ord. 9767 Art. 3 § 61, 1969.)
17.12.510 - Surfriders' Beach—Swimming prohibited when.
The board of supervisors finds that the regulations imposed by this Part 3, as well as safety requirements, make the use of surfboards impossible during those times when the beaches are occupied by many swimmers and bathers. The board of supervisors also finds that the use of surfboards and paddleboards is a legitimate sport, and that there should be at least one area in which surfboards safely may be used even during those days and those hours when the beaches are most heavily attended, and that it is necessary, therefore, to prohibit in such areas other persons so that such other persons will not be injured. A person shall not swim, bathe or immerse himself in the waters of the Pacific Ocean opposite Surfriders' Beach or opposite any other area designated, except while using a surfboard or paddleboard, or as necessary in order to use a surfboard or paddleboard.
