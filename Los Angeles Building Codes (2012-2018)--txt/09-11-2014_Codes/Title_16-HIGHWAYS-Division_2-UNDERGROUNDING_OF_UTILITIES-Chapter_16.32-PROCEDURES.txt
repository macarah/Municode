When the board, from time to time, after consultation with the utility affected, and after holding public hearings on the subject, finds either or both of the following are in the general public interest:

That existing overhead electric or communication facilities presently located within certain designated areas, or sections thereof, of the county be removed and replaced with underground electric or communication facilities; and
2.
That any future or new electric communication facilities located within certain designated areas, or sections thereof, of the county be underground electric or communication facilities it may, by amendment to this Division 2, declare such designated areas, or sections thereof, an underground utility district, and may, by amendment to this Division 2, add to, modify, amend or delete certain designated areas, or sections thereof, from existing districts. Each amendment shall include a description of the area, or sections thereof, comprising the district, or sections thereof, affected by the particular amendment.
B.
The board's findings may be based on one or more of the following reasons:
1.
Such undergrounding will avoid or eliminate an unusually heavy concentration of overhead electric or communication facilities;
2.
Such designated areas, or sections thereof, are extensively used by the general public and carry a heavy volume of pedestrian or vehicular traffic;
3.
Such designated areas, or sections thereof, adjoin or pass through civic areas or public recreation areas or areas of unusual scenic interest to the general public;
