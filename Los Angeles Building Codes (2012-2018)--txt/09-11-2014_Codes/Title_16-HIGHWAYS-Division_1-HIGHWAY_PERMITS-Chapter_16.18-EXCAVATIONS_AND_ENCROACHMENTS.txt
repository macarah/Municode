16.18.050 - Pipelines carrying hazardous substances—Pressure test specifications.
A.
After initial installation under this Division 1 of any pipeline used or to be used to carry toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids, such pipeline shall be subject to a hydrostatic pressure test as provided herein before it is placed in operation. The duration of the hydrostatic test for this purpose shall not be less than 24 hours.
B.
After repair or replacement of any pipeline used or to be used to carry toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids, made necessary to repair leaks or breaks, or replacements made necessary for changes required by improvements within the roadway, the affected portion of the pipeline shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test as provided herein before placing in operation. The duration of the hydrostatic test for this purpose shall be not less than 24 hours. However, no such test is required for a minor repair which does not require removal of the pipeline from operation. If the affected section is isolated and tested hydrostatically, pressure test of the tie-in welds is not required; however, tie-in welds shall be examined by radiographic means.
C.
No pipeline subject to this Division 1 used or to be used to carry toxic, corrosive or flammable liquids and over 10 years of age shall be operated beyond the successive ensuing 12-month period of time unless retested annually by a hydrostatic pressure test or other test means acceptable to the commissioner. The duration of the periodic test for this purpose shall not be less than four hours.
D.
Each pressure test, either initial or retest, shall be in accordance with the American National Standard Institute's Code for Pressure Piping, Liquid Petroleum Transportation Piping Systems (ANSI B 31.4) in its latest revision. The commissioner may authorize the use of a liquid petroleum that does not vaporize rapidly (i.e., flash point over 150 degrees Fahrenheit or 66 degrees Centigrade) as a test medium. Pressure tests after initial installation of pipelines and before they are placed in operation shall show no unexplained loss. Annual or retest pressure tests shall not show an hourly loss, for each section of the pipeline under test at the time, in excess of either 10 gallons, or the sum of one gallon and an amount computed at a rate in gallons per mile equivalent to one-tenth of the nominal internal diameter of the pipe.
E.
The commissioner may grant administrative waiver or other relief to an owner or operator under this Division 1 as to the periodic pressure testing of any pipelines as herein provided if owner or operator can demonstrate that such testing will cause the unreasonable unscheduled shutdown of plants, terminals, refineries or other facilities of which such pipelines constitute an integral part.
F.
In addition to the foregoing requirements, any pipeline authorized by this Division 1 and subject to pressure testing shall be subjected to a pressure test by the owner or operator at any time as may be required by the commissioner in the interest of public safety.
G.
Within 30 days after completion of any test made pursuant to the provisions of this Division 1, the owner or operator shall submit a certified report of such text for the commissioner's review. The report shall show the date of test, description of portion of pipeline tested (identified with respect to county highways), and the test data. The report shall be sufficient in detail to permit analysis of test results and determination of compliance with the applicable provisions of the ordinance codified in this division or any other applicable ordinance, rule or regulation. The report shall also contain any other test information as may be specifically requested by the commissioner.
