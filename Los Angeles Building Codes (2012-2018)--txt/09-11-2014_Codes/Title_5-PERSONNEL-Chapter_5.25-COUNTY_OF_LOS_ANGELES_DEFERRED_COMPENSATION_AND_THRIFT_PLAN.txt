Sections:

5.25.001 - Restatement.
This Deferred Compensation and Thrift Plan has been amended and restated effective January 1, 1999, to comply with and reflect certain changes made to the Code by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA") and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.010 - Purpose.
This Deferred Compensation and Thrift Plan (also known as the "Horizons Plan") is designed to permit Eligible Employees of Los Angeles County to defer a portion of their compensation in order to provide for themselves and their Beneficiaries supplemental retirement and death benefits. The Horizons Plan is intended to meet the requirements for an eligible deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457. The Plan also provides matching contributions to active employees who make contributions to the Plan. Benefits under the Plan shall at all times be limited to those payable from each Participant's Investment Accounts.
While the County intends to continue the Plan indefinitely, it reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan in accordance with Section 5.25.110.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)

The maximum amount that may be deferred in any of the last three Plan Years ending before the Plan Year in which the Participant attains Normal Retirement Age may be increased to the lesser of (a) $15,000.00, or (b) the sum of the Plan ceiling for the Plan Year determined as above and any deferrals (subject to such ceiling) not utilized for prior taxable years after December 31, 1978 in which the Participant was eligible to participate in any "eligible deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 457(b) of the Code.
3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount that may be deferred under the Plan for any Plan Year shall be reduced (a) by the amount deferred for such Plan Year under any other "eligible deferred compensation plan," (b) by any amount excludable from the Participant's gross income for such Plan Year under Section 403(b) of the Code on account of contributions made by the County, (c) by any amount excludable from the Participant's gross income for such Plan Year under Section 402(e)(3) or 402(h)(1)(B) or (k) of the Code, and (d) by any amount with respect to which a deduction is allowable for such Plan Year by reason of a contribution to an organization described in Section 501(c)(18) of the Code.
4.
Except as provided in subsection A.5., for purposes of this subsection A., amounts deferred under the Plan include all Deferred Compensation Contributions for such Plan Year and the greater of (a) any Matching Contributions made during such Plan Year, or (b) the amount of any Matching Contributions and the earnings thereon which have vested pursuant to Section 5.25.080F during such Plan Year. Any Matching Contributions taken into account under this Subsection when made shall not be taken into account in a later Plan Year.
5.
Notwithstanding subsection A.4. effective the 2003 Plan Year, for purposes of applying this subsection A. to Participants who are subject to the Combined Limit under the Savings Plan, Matching Contributions shall be treated as amounts deferred under the Plan in the Plan Year in which the Matching Contributions are made, and, in the 2003 Plan Year, amounts deferred under the Plan also shall include amounts that are treated as vesting in that Plan Year that were not previously taken into account under subsection A.4.
B.
This subsection B. shall apply for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, unless a later effective date is provided.
1.
The amount that a Participant may defer under a Participation Agreement and the Plan for any Plan Year shall not exceed a ceiling which shall be the lesser of (a) the Dollar Limit, as defined in this subsection, or (b) 100 percent of the Participant's Includible Compensation, provided, that the cumulative amount deferred shall not exceed 100 percent of the Participant's cumulative Includible Compensation for the current Plan Year. The "Dollar Limit" means the "applicable dollar limit" as defined in Code section 457(e)(15) or a successor provision. For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, the Dollar Limit shall be adjusted for the calendar year to reflect increases in cost-of-living in accordance with Code sections 457(e)(15) and 415(d).
2.
The maximum amount under B.1. that may be deferred in any of the last three Plan Years ending before the Plan Year in which the Participant attains Normal Retirement Age may be increased to the lesser of (a) twice the Dollar Limit in effect for such Plan Year, or (b) the sum of the Plan ceiling for the Plan Year determined under 5.25.040B.1. plus the Plan ceiling for any prior taxable years (determined under the applicable Code section 457(b)(2) limits and coordination requirements) in which the Participant was eligible to participate in the Plan, less the amount of Deferred Compensation Contributions (other than Catch-Up Contributions) made to the Plan for such prior taxable years.
3.
Except as provided in subsection B.4, for purposes of this subsection B., amounts deferred under the Plan include all Deferred Compensation Contributions (other than Catch-Up Contributions made pursuant to subsection C.) for such Plan Year and the greater of (a) any Matching Contributions made during such Plan Year, or (b) the amount of any Matching Contributions and the earnings thereon which have vested pursuant to Section 5.25.080F during such Plan Year. Any Matching Contributions taken into account under this Subsection when made shall not be taken into account in a later Plan Year.
4.
Notwithstanding subsection B.3., effective the 2003 Plan Year, for purposes of determining the limitations under subsections B.1., B.2., D. and E. and excess deferrals under subsection F., Matching Contributions shall be treated as amounts deferred under the Plan in the Plan Year in which the Matching Contribution is made, and, in the 2003 Plan Year, amounts deferred under the Plan also shall include amounts that are treated as vesting in that Plan Year that were not previously taken into account under subsection B.3.
5.
This subsection shall not apply to any Participant who is subject to the Combined Limit as defined in the Savings Plan.
C.
Beginning on or after September 1, 2003, the following provisions shall apply:
1.
A Participant who has attained the age of 50 or older before the close of any Plan Year and is eligible to make Deferred Compensation Contributions under the Plan shall be eligible to have the County make Catch-Up Contributions to the Plan from his or her Eligible Earnings during such Plan Year in excess of the Code limitations set forth in Section 5.25.040B.1 or comparable limitations or restrictions contained in the terms of this Plan.
2.
The amount of Deferred Compensation Contributions treated as Catch-Up Contributions for any calendar year shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the applicable dollar limits provided for in Code section 414(v)(2)(B); or (b) the excess, if any, of the Participant's Includible Compensation for the year over any other elective deferrals, as defined in Code section 414(u)(2)(C), made by the Participant for such year other than catch-up contributions made pursuant to Code section 414(v). For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, the applicable dollar limit shall be adjusted for the calendar year to reflect the increases in cost-of-living in accordance with Code sections 414(v) and 415(d).
3.
This subsection shall not apply to any Participant who is subject to the Combined Limit as defined in the Savings Plan.
D.
In any Plan Year in which a Participant meets the eligibility requirements both to defer the maximum amount permitted under subsection B.2. and to make a Catch-Up Contribution under subsection C., the Participant shall be eligible to defer under the Plan the greater of (i) the maximum amount that may be deferred under subsection B.1. as modified by subsection B.2., or (ii) the maximum amount that may be deferred under subsection B.1. plus the maximum Catch-up Contribution under subsection. C.
E.
In any Plan Year in which the Participant participates in more than one "eligible deferred compensation plan," within the meaning of Code section 457(b), maintained by any "eligible employer," within the meaning of Code section 457(e)(1), the limitations on Deferred Compensation Contributions and Catch-up Contributions under subsection B.1, B.2 and C., shall apply to a Participant's aggregate annual amounts deferred under all such eligible deferred compensation plans in accordance with the individual limitation under Code section 457(c). For purposes of applying the individual limitation under Code section 457(c), the Plan limitation set forth in subsection B.2. (special Code section 457 contribution for the three Plan Years prior to the Participant's Normal Retirement Age) shall be taken into account only to the extent that a Deferred Compensation Contribution is made for a Participant under the Plan as a result of such Plan limitation.
F.
In any Plan Year in which the Participant participates in more than one "eligible deferred compensation plan," within the meaning of Code section 457(b), maintained by the County, the limitations on Deferred Compensation Contributions (including Matching Contributions) and Catch-up Contributions as determined under subsections B.1, B.2, B.4 and C., shall apply to a Participant's aggregate annual amounts deferred under all such eligible deferred compensation plans.
1.
Amounts deferred under all such eligible deferred compensation plans in excess of the maximum amounts determined under subsections B.1, B.2, B.4 and C. shall be distributed to the Participant, with allocable net income, as soon as administratively practical after the amount of the excess deferral is determined. With respect to excess deferrals that are attributable to Deferred Compensation Contributions and Catch-Up Contributions, the excess deferrals shall be includible in gross income of the Participant in the taxable year in which the amounts were deferred under the Plan. With respect to excess deferrals that are attributable to Matching Contributions, the excess deferrals shall be includible in gross income of the Participant in the taxable year in which the contributions are made to the Plan or, if later, the taxable year in which the amounts (including the allocable net income on such amounts) are vested pursuant to Section 5.25.080F.
2.
Excess deferrals will be distributed from contributions that, pursuant to this provision, are treated as having been made to the Plan last. To the extent administratively practical, in any taxable year in which it is determined that excess deferrals are made to the Plan, the Plan will treat the contributions to the Plan as being made in the following order: first, Matching Contributions (including the allocable net income on such amounts) that were made to the Plan in a prior year but became fully vested in the taxable year that excess deferrals are made; second, fully vested Matching Contributions that were made to the Plan in the taxable year that excess deferrals are made; third, Deferred Compensation Contributions; and, fourth, Catch-Up Contributions.

5.25.050 - Matching contributions.
A.
Effective beginning January 1, 2001, unless another matching contribution rate is established in a memorandum of understanding affecting the fringe benefits of a Participant, for every dollar of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Contribution under the Plan, to a maximum of 4 percent of such Participant' s Compensation in any month within the period from July 1st of a Plan Year to June 30th of the next Plan Year, the County shall contribute $1 from the Matching Fund; provided, however, that for Participants who are Eligible Employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding the aggregate amount of Matching Contributions under the Plan for such July 1st to June 30th period shall not exceed the dollar cap, if any, established by the Board of Supervisors.
B.
The Deferred Compensation Contribution under this Plan of each Participant who is an Eligible Employee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding shall be matched on a monthly basis as provided herein until the dollar cap on the Matching Fund, if any, is exhausted. In the event that amounts remaining in the Matching Fund are determined by the County to be insufficient to meet the Matching Contributions required herein for the next succeeding month due to any dollar cap established by the Board of Supervisors, the County shall allocate the amount remaining in the Matching Fund to the Deferred Compensation Contributions of each such Participant for such month on a pro rata basis at a reduced ratio, and shall notify said Participants that the Matching Fund is about to be exhausted. The Board shall designate the amount, if any under such terms and conditions as it may establish, which is to be set aside as the Matching Fund for any succeeding period selected by the Board and the ratio for such period at which Deferred Compensation Contributions are to be matched on a monthly basis. Participants who are Eligible Employees not subject to a memorandum of understanding shall not be subject to an annual cap on Matching Contributions or permitted to receive Matching Contributions allocated for Participants who are eligible Employees subject to a memorandum of understanding.
C.
Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, each reference to "month" in this Section 5.25.050 shall be deemed to be a reference to "payroll period" and each reference to "on a monthly basis" shall be deemed to be a reference to "each payroll period."

Notwithstanding subsection A, unless another matching contribution rate is established in a memorandum of understanding affecting the fringe benefits of a Participant: (i) no Matching Contributions shall be made by the County with regard to Deferred Compensation Contributions made with respect to payroll periods starting January 1, 2011 and continuing through June 30, 2011; and (ii) for every dollar of a Participant's Deferred Compensation Contributions made with respect to each payroll period starting July 1, 2011 and continuing through June 30, 2012, the County shall contribute one dollar from the Matching Fund; provided, however, that: (a) for Participants who are Eligible Employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding the County's maximum contribution shall be 2 percent of such Participant's Compensation for each such payroll period, and (b) for all other Eligible Employees the County's maximum contribution shall be 3 percent of such Participant's Compensation for each such payroll period. The aggregate amount of Matching Contributions under the Plan for such July 1st to June 30th period shall not exceed the respective dollar caps to be determined by the Board of Supervisors for each category of Participants in subsections 5.25.050(D)(ii)(a) and (b). This subsection D shall not apply to Trial Court Employees or judges, who shall continue to receive Matching Contributions pursuant to the provisions set forth in the foregoing subsections of this Section 5.25.050
(Ord. 2014-0008 § 4, 2014; Ord. 2010-0063 § 6, 2010; Ord. 2010-0014, § 4, 2010; Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)

The Trustee shall invest the assets of the Trust Fund in accordance with the instructions of Participants and the Administrative Committee as provided in this Section.
B.
Investment by Participants. Each Participant may instruct the Trustee or TPA, as applicable, to allocate his or her Deferred Compensation Contributions and the portion of his or her Matching Contributions that are 100 percent vested and nonforfeitable (collectively, "Contributions") among the Investment Funds. A Participant may only instruct the Trustee or TPA to allocate amounts to the Personal Brokerage Account Window if the Participant's Investment Account balance invested in the Core Funds satisfies the threshold level determined by the Administrative Committee. A Participant may change the allocation of future Contributions among Core Funds and may transfer past Contributions, adjusted for earnings, gains and losses, and applicable Plan charges, if any, from one Core Fund to another, or between a Core Fund and the Personal Brokerage Account Window. Amounts allocated to and from the Personal Brokerage Account Window are allocated pursuant to Section 5.25.070.C. A Participant may make investment elections at the time and manner prescribed by procedures established from time to time by the Administrative Committee.
C.
Investment through Personal Brokerage Account Window. Any amount of a Participant's Investment Account allocated by a Participant to the Personal Brokerage Account Window pursuant to Section 5.25.070.B shall be transferred first into the Brokerage Money Market Fund.

5.25.075 - Trust fund allocation and valuation.
A.
Allocation.
1.
Contributions made to the Plan on behalf of a Participant shall be deposited and credited to the Participant's Investment Accounts within a period that is not longer than is reasonable for the proper administration of the accounts of Participants, but in no event later than the 15th business day of the month following the month in which the Participant's Deferred Compensation Contributions otherwise would have been payable to such Participant in cash.
2.
Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrative Committee, the assets credited to each Participant's Investment Accounts shall be allocated among the Core Funds in accordance with the investment option or options chosen by such Participant or the Administrative Committee, as the case may be, effective no later than the first business day following the business day on which the Trustee or its Agent has received appropriate instructions, or such later date as is commercially reasonable under the circumstances. Transfers from the Core Funds to the Personal Brokerage Account Window, from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to Core Funds, from the Brokerage Money Market Fund to Brokerage Investments, between Brokerage Investments, and from such Brokerage Investments back to the Brokerage Money Market Fund shall be completed within a commercially reasonable time and in accordance with the terms of any applicable TPA and Broker contracts.
3.
As of each Valuation Date, the net gain or loss of each Investment Fund, determined in accordance with Section 5.25.075B. below, shall be allocated by the Trustee or its Agent in accordance with the instructions received by the Trustee from the TPA to the Investment Accounts of Participants in such Investment Funds in proportion to the amounts of such Investment Accounts invested in such Investment Fund on such Valuation Date, exclusive of amounts to be credited but including amounts (other than the net loss, if any, determined pursuant to Section 5.25.075B.) to be debited to such Investment Accounts as of such Valuation Date.
B.
Valuation.
1.
As of the close of business each Valuation Date, the TPA or the custodian, as delegated by the Administrative Committee, shall determine or cause to be determined the value of each Core Fund. Valuation of the Participant holdings in the Brokerage Investments shall be communicated to the TPA by the Broker pursuant to the agreement between the Administrative Committee and the Broker. The TPA or custodian may rely on net asset value calculations, book values and other data with respect to the value of Plan assets held in the Investment Funds furnished to it by the Administrative Committee, Investment Managers, the County Treasurer, custodians or other entities authorized to provide valuation data. The transfer of funds to or from an Investment Fund, the allocation of Deferred Compensation Contributions, Rollover Contributions and Matching Contributions, and payments, distributions and withdrawals from an Investment Fund to provide benefits under the Plan for Participants or Beneficiaries shall not be deemed to be income, expenses or losses of an Investment Fund. The TPA or custodian shall communicate such valuations to the Trustee.
2.
One or more methods of valuation may be used in determining the value of the Core Funds. Subject to the TPA's or custodian's rights and duties under the contract between it and the County, the reasonable and equitable decision of the TPA or custodian as to the value of each Core Fund as of each Valuation Date shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and Beneficiaries having any interest, direct or indirect, in such Core Fund.
3.
The TPA shall be responsible for monthly reconciliation of its records with the records of the third-parties from which it receives valuation data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Committee or its Agent may, in accordance with applicable requirements of the Code and California law, instruct the TPA to adopt such accounting procedures as the Administrative Committee or its Agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to establish a proportionate crediting of net gain or loss of an Investment Fund and of contributions made to an Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date.
C.
No Guarantee Against Loss. The County, the Board, the Administrative Committee, the TPA and the Trustee do not guarantee in any manner the Investment Funds or any part thereof against loss or depreciation. All persons having an interest in the Investment Funds shall look solely to such Funds for payment with respect to such interest. The County, the Board, the Administrative Committee, the TPA and the Trustee are not authorized to advise a Participant as to that Participant's selection of Investment Funds, and the fact that designated Investment Funds are available to Participants for investment shall not be construed as a recommendation for the investment of contributions hereunder in all or any of such Funds. The selection of an Investment Fund by a Participant is his or her sole responsibility and shall constitute an exercise of control over the assets of his or her Investment Accounts. Each Participant who so exercises control shall, by such exercise, release and agree, on his or her behalf and on behalf of his or her heirs and beneficiaries, to indemnify and hold harmless the County, the Board, the Administrative Committee, the TPA, the Trustee and any Agent, officer or employee of any of them, from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, costs or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by or arising out of such exercise, including without limitation any diminution in value or losses incurred from such exercise. Further, it is the intent of the County and the Board that Section 53213.5 of the Government Code apply to the Plan.

In addition, effective November 1, 2003, an active Participant may apply for a loan from the Plan.

Substantially equal monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installments not extending over more than twenty years; or
c.
Consecutive periodic payments for the life of the Participant or for the lives of the Participant and his or her designated Beneficiary, and the last survivor of them; or
d.
A combination of the methods of payment described in subdivisions a, b, and c of this subsection.
In the event that the vested balance of any Participant's Investment Account (determined without regard to the Participant's Rollover Account) does not exceed $5,000.00 (or the dollar limit under Code section 411(a)(11), if greater), the Participant's interest under the Plan shall be payable only in a lump sum at such time as elected by the Participant or Beneficiary in accordance with Section 5.25.080A. If a Participant does not make a timely election regarding the distribution of his benefits after receiving the notice required under Code section 402(f), the Participant will be deemed to have elected to defer distribution of his benefits, provided, however, that the Participant's benefits will be distributed in a single cash payment as soon as administratively feasible, without the Participant's consent, if the Participant's Investment Account balance is $1,000.00 or less on the date of distribution.
2.
Participants and Beneficiaries whose distributions under this Plan have already begun or who have elected to defer the commencement of distributions, may elect to change their previously irrevocable payment elections no more frequently than once in any Plan Year, which election shall be deemed to be made at the time that the benefit election becomes effective. The election shall be made on a form approved by the Administrative Committee and shall be subject to the minimum distribution requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. This subsection B2 shall not apply to Participants and Beneficiaries whose benefits under the Plan are provided through an annuity purchased from an insurance carrier.
3.
All distributions hereunder shall be made on or begun as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant's application is filed pursuant to Section 5.25.080 A. and approved by the Administrative Committee. A Participant's election to begin distributions and selection of a payment method shall be irrevocable except as provided in subsection B2. For the purpose of benefit distributions, the date that such Participant's interest in an Investment Fund is liquidated or redeemed, partially or in full, to satisfy the distribution application shall be the applicable Valuation Date. Any amounts remaining in the Participant's Investment Accounts after the date that distribution commences shall continue to be credited with earnings and losses in accordance with Section 5.25.075
4.
If a Participant to whom benefit payments from his or her Investment Accounts have commenced pursuant to this subsection due to Separation from Employment should again become an Eligible Employee before completion of the distribution of his or her Investment Accounts, no further distribution shall be made on account of such prior Separation from Employment. Any amounts which the Participant was entitled to receive on his or her prior Separation from Employment shall be held in the Plan until the Participant or his or her Beneficiary is again entitled to a distribution under the terms of the Plan.
5.
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, if a Participant or Beneficiary elects a life annuity or joint and survivor annuity form of benefit, to provide such benefit the Administrative Committee may instruct the Trustee to purchase an annuity contract with the balance in the Participant's Investment Account, valued in accordance with subsection A(ii) of this section.
6.
Distributions will begin in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder and Section 5.25.080 C of the Plan. Such provisions will override any inconsistent distribution option.
7.
If, following the Participant's death and subject to the required minimum distribution rules under Section 5.25.080 C of the Plan, a Beneficiary elects to defer distribution of the Participant's Account, he may direct the investment of such Account as though he was the Participant in accordance with section 5.25.070; provided, however, that if a portion of the Participant's Account is invested through the Personal Brokerage Account Window, the Beneficiary will be required to enter his own contract with the Broker to open a brokerage account and retain any investments held in the Account through the Personal Brokerage Account Window.
C.
Code section 401(a)(9) Minimum Distribution Requirements. The provisions of this subsection C will apply for the purposes of determining required minimum distributions for Distribution Calendar Years beginning with the 2003 calendar year and for required minimum distributions for the 2002 Distribution Calendar Year that are made on or after the action taken by the Board to pass the ordinance adopting this restated Plan. The requirements of this subsection C will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan.
1.
Definitions. For the purposes of this subsection C, the following terms, when used with initial capital letters, shall have the following respective meanings:
a.
"Designated Beneficiary": The person who is designated as the Beneficiary as defined in Section 5.25.020 D of the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the Treasury Regulations.
b.
"Distribution Calendar Year": A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Participant's Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under subsection C3b of the Plan. The required minimum distribution for the Participant's first Distribution Calendar Year will be made on or before the Participant's Required Beginning Date. The required minimum distribution for other Distribution Calendar Years, including the required minimum distribution for the Distribution Calendar Year in which the Member's Required Beginning Date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that Distribution Calendar Year.
c.
"Life Expectancy": Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations.
d.
"Participant's Account Balance": The Investment Accounts balance as of the last Valuation Date in the calendar year immediately preceding the Distribution Calendar Year (the "Valuation Calendar Year") increased by the amount of any contributions made and allocated or forfeitures allocated to the Investment Account balance as of dates in the Valuation Calendar Year after the Valuation Date and decreased by distributions made in the Valuation Calendar Year after the Valuation Date. The Investment Accounts balance for the Valuation Calendar Year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the Plan either in the Valuation Calendar Year or in the Distribution Calendar Year if distributed or transferred in the Valuation Calendar Year.
e.
"Required Beginning Date": The applicable date specified in subsection 3 below.
2.
General Rules. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, all distributions required under this Section 5.25.080 will be determined and made in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code. The only permissible distribution options under this Plan are a lump sum distribution, substantially equal monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual installments not extending over more than twenty years, consecutive periodic payments for the life of the Participant or for the lives of the Participant and his or her designated Beneficiary, a combination of such methods of payment to the extent permitted in subsection B, or minimum monthly distributions calculated in accordance with the rules provided in this subsection C.
3.
Time of Distribution.
a.
The Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date. Except as described in subsection 3b below, the Required Beginning Date of any Participant shall be the April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (1) the calendar year he terminates employment or (2) the calendar year he attains age 70½.
b.
If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
(1)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection 3d below is made, distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70½, if later.
(2)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection 3d below is made, distributions to the Designated Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died.
(3)
If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
(4)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection 3b, other than subsection 3b(1), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
c.
For purposes of this subsection C, unless subsection 3b(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Beginning Date. If subsection 3b(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 3b(1). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant's Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 3b(4)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
d.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant dies before distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, distribution to the Designated Beneficiary is not required to begin by the Required Beginning Date specified above if the Participant or the Beneficiary elects, on an individual basis, that the Participant's entire interest will be distributed to the Designated Beneficiary by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; provided, however, that if the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to either the Participant or the surviving spouse begin, this election will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. The election provided in this subsection 3d must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distribution would be required to begin, or by September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the Participant's (or, if applicable, surviving spouse's) death.
4.
Required Minimum Distributions During Participant's Lifetime.
a.
During the Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of:
(1)
the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year; or
(2)
if the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant's spouse and the spouse is more than 10 years younger than the Participant, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year.
b.
Required minimum distributions will be determined under this subsection C4 beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant's date of death.
c.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations.
5.
Required Minimum Distributions if Participant Dies After Distributions Begin.
a.
Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as follows:
(1)
The Participant's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(2)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as of the spouse's birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving spouse's death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.
(3)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated Beneficiary's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
b.
No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary (for example, if pursuant to the Plan, the Beneficiary is the Participant's estate) as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the Participant's remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
c.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations.
6.
Death before Date Distributions Begin.
a.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection C3d above is made, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in subsection C5a above.
b.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
c.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 3b(1), this subsection C will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
d.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations.
7.
Coordination with Minimum Distribution Requirements Previously in Effect. If the total amount of 2002 required minimum distributions under the Plan made to the distributee prior to the effective date of this subsection C equals or exceeds the required minimum distributions determined under this subsection C, then no additional distributions will be required to be made for 2002 on or after such date to the distributee. If the total amount of 2002 required minimum distributions under the Plan made to the distributee prior to the effective date of this subsection C is less than the amount determined under this subsection C, then required minimum distributions for 2002 on and after such date will be determined so that the total amount of required minimum distributions for 2002 made to the distributee will be the amount determined under this subsection C.
8.
Notwithstanding the other subsections of this Section 5.25.080, a Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 2009 but for the enactment of section 401(a)(9)(H) of the Code (2009 RMDs), and who would have satisfied that requirement by receiving distributions that are (1) equal to the 2009 RMDs or (2) one or more payments in a series of substantially equal distributions (that include the 2009 RMDs) made at least annually and expected to last for the life (or life expectancy) of the Participant, the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary, or for a period of at least 10 years, will not receive those distributions for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses to receive such distributions. Participants and Beneficiaries described in the preceding sentence will be given the opportunity to elect to receive the distributions described in the preceding sentence. For the purposes of this subsection C8, any election on file to receive automated RMDs, even if received before 2009, is treated as an election to receive those distributions in 2009 except to the extent such election is revoked in accordance with a procedure established by the TPA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a direct rollover will be offered only for distributions that would be Eligible Rollover Distributions without regard to Code section 401(a)(9)(H).
D.
Voluntary In-Service Distribution. A Participant who is an active employee of the County shall receive a distribution of all or a portion of the amount payable to the Participant under the Plan if the following requirements are met:
1.
The amount of the distribution payable to the Participant under the Plan (determined without regard to a Participant's Rollover Account) does not exceed $5,000 (or the dollar limit under Code Section 411(a)(11), if greater),
2.
The participant has not previously received an in-service distribution under this section of the Plan,
3.
No amount has been deferred under the Plan with respect to that Participant during the two-year period ending on the date of the in-service distribution, and
4.
The Participant elects to receive the distribution.
Any distribution permitted pursuant to this subsection shall be paid from amounts held in the Participant's Investment Accounts in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee or its Agent (provided that, to the extent possible to satisfy the Participant's distribution request, amounts attributable to Eligible Retirement Plans described in Section 5.25.020 QQ(ii) and held in a separate Rollover Account (or subaccount) shall be used last to satisfy the distribution requested).
E.
Emergency Withdrawals.
1.
The Administrative Committee or its Agent, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant upon written request to the County to make a withdrawal from the Plan to meet an unforeseeable emergency.
2.
An "unforeseeable emergency" is a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant or the Participant's spouse or dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Code, and for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, without regard to section 152(b)(1), (b)(2) or (d)(1)(B) of the Code), loss of the Participant's property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. Whether a Participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency is to be determined by the Administrative Committee or its Agent based on the relevant facts and circumstances of each case. The following events may constitute an unforeseeable emergency: imminent foreclosure of or eviction from the Participant's primary residence, the need to pay for medical expenses, such as non-refundable deductibles and prescription drug medication, and the need to pay funeral expenses of the Participant's spouse or a dependent (as defined in section 152 of the Code, and for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, without regard to section 152(b)(1), (b)(2) or (d)(1)(B) of the Code). In applying these rules, the Plan may treat the Participant's primary Beneficiary like the Participant's spouse or dependents in determining whether the Participant has incurred an unforeseeable emergency.
3.
A withdrawal under this subsection may not be made to the extent the emergency is or can be relieved through compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the Participant's other assets (to the extent the liquidation would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or ceasing further deferrals under the Plan. As a condition of making a withdrawal under this subsection, the Participant irrevocably elects to suspend all elective contributions and employee contributions under this Plan (e.g., Deferred Compensation Contributions) and all other plans of deferred compensation maintained by the County from the date on which the withdrawal is made until the close of the six-calendar-month period that began on the first day of the month following the date on which the withdrawal is made. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "other plans of deferred compensation" include, without limitation, all qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans and any cash or deferred arrangements that are part of a cafeteria plan, except that it does not include the mandatory employee contribution component of a defined benefit plan or welfare plan. If a Participant who also participates in the Savings Plan takes a hardship distribution under the Savings Plan, then, in accordance with the terms of the Savings Plan, that Participant likewise irrevocably elects to suspend all elective contributions and employee contributions under all plans of deferred compensation maintained by the County, including this Plan, from the date on which the withdrawal is made until the close of the six-calendar-month period that began on the first day of the month following the date on which the withdrawal is made.
4.
Withdrawal of amounts based on an unforeseeable emergency will be permitted by the Administrative Committee or its Agent only to the extent reasonably needed to satisfy the emergency (which may include any amounts necessary to pay any taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution), and shall not exceed the vested amounts credited to such Participant's Investment Accounts. Any withdrawal permitted pursuant to this subsection shall be paid from amounts held in the Participant's Investment Accounts in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee or its Agent (provided that, to the extent possible to satisfy the Participant's withdrawal request, amounts attributable to Eligible Retirement Plans described in Section 5.25.020 QQ(ii) and held in a separate Rollover Account (or subaccount) shall be used last to satisfy the emergency withdrawal requested).
5.
Any withdrawal permitted pursuant to this section shall be paid by the Trustee within 60 days of approval by the Administrative Committee or its Agent of the Participant's written request.
F.
Vesting and Forfeitures.
1.
Any amount credited to a Participant's Deferred Account and Rollover Account shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested. In Plan Years prior to 2003, (a) any amount credited to a Participant's Matching Account shall vest and become nonforfeitable at the rate of 10 percent for each of the first four Years of Service and shall be 100 percent vested after five Years of Service; and (b) notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, any amount credited to a Participant's Matching Account shall become nonforfeitable and fully vested without regard to Years of Service upon his or her (i) Retirement, (ii) Separation from Employment due to his or her death or Disability, or (iii) attainment of age 70. Unvested amounts held in a Participant's Matching Contribution Account on or after January 1, 2003 shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested regardless of when the amounts were credited to such account. Any amount credited to a Participant's Matching Contribution Account in the 2003 Plan Year and thereafter, shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested.
2.
This subsection 2 applies only with respect to Plan Years prior to 2003. In the event of a Separation from Employment prior to Retirement which is not caused by the death or Disability of the Participant, on the date of Separation from Employment, such Participant shall irrevocably forfeit the portion of his or her Matching Account which has not vested as provided herein, and his or her Matching Account shall be debited an amount equal to such unvested portion. If such Participant (or former Participant to whom the vested amount credited to his or her Investment Account has been distributed in full) again becomes an Eligible Employee and subsequently becomes party to another Participation Agreement, any Matching Contributions previously forfeited shall not be restored. Any new Matching Contributions thereafter made by the County, and any earnings and investment gains or losses allocable thereto, shall be credited to a separate Matching Account maintained for such Participant and shall vest as provided herein without regard to any Year of Service prior to such Separation from Employment.
G.
Lost Participants. If the Participant or his or her Beneficiary cannot be located within four years of the date the Participant's interest under the Plan is first payable, the entire balance in his or her Investment Accounts shall be forfeited to an unallocated forfeiture account under the Plan; provided, however, that the amount so forfeited shall be reinstated as of the date of the subsequent filing of an application for benefits under the Plan, and payment of the lump sum benefit shall occur no later than 60 days after such application is filed.
H.
Application of Forfeitures. The amount (if any) of Participant's Investment Accounts which is forfeited for a Plan Year in accordance with Section 5.25.080 F or G shall be placed in one or more forfeiture accounts held in the Trust Fund and applied first, to restore the accounts of lost Participants who have filed an application for benefits, if any, and second, to offset future Matching Contributions to be made by the County. Earnings on the forfeiture accounts held in the Trust Fund shall be used to reduce administrative expenses of the Plan in accordance with Section 5.25.090 G3.
I.
Loans to Participants.
1.
Upon application by an active Participant, but subject to such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as the Administrative Committee or its Agent may establish and to the provisions of this section, the Administrative Committee may in its discretion direct the Trustee to make a loan or loans to a Participant from his separate account in the Participant Loan Fund in an amount not exceeding the excess of:
a.
The lesser of:
(1)
$50,000.00, reduced by the excess (if any) of:
(i)
The highest outstanding balance of loans to such Participant from the Plan during the one-year period ending on the day before the date on which such new loan was made,
(ii)
Over the outstanding balance of loans to such Participant from the Plan on the date on which such new loan was made, or
(2)
50 percent of the vested portion of the Participant's Account balance; or
(3)
100 percent of the vested portion of the Participant's Account balance allocated to Core Funds.
b.
Over the outstanding balance of any other loan or loans from the Plan to the Participant; provided, however, that if 50 percent of the vested portion of the Participant's Account balance is less than $10,000.00, the amount in subsection Ila of this section shall be the lesser of $10,000.00 or 80 percent of the vested portion of the Participant's Account balance. The minimum loan that may be made from the Plan is $2,000.00 (or such other amount determined by the Administrative Committee). All loans hereunder shall be subject to such loan processing fees charged by the Trustee, Investment Manager and TPA as are approved by the Administrative Committee, which fees shall be paid by borrowing Participants.
2.
As soon as practicable after the receipt of all necessary information and directions from the Administrative Committee to make a loan and prior to making any loan pursuant to subsection 1 of this section, but in no event later than 30 days after the applicable Valuation Date, the Trustee or Investment Manager shall transfer, in accordance with procedures determined by the Administrative Committee, to the Participant Loan Fund from the assets invested in other Investment Funds allocated to the Account of each borrowing Participant an amount equal to the amount of such Participant's loan, which investment shall be allocated to such Participant's Account. The Participant Loan Fund shall be invested solely in loans to Participants made pursuant to this section and shall at all times be at least equal to the total amount of such loans. All interest and principal payments made by such Participant shall be credited to the separate account within the Participant Loan Fund of each Participant who borrows money from the Plan. Except as otherwise provided by the Administrative Committee, as of each Valuation Date all cash in the Participant Loan Fund shall be transferred to the other Investment Funds in accordance with each borrowing Participant's investment choice under Section 5.25.070
3.
Loans made pursuant to subsection 1 of this section:
a.
Shall be secured by the Participant's Investment Accounts (provided that, to the extent possible to satisfy the loan application, amounts attributable to Eligible Retirement Plans described in Section 5.25.020 QQ(ii) and held in a separate Rollover Account (or subaccount) shall be used last to satisfy the loan amount requested) and such other collateral as the Administrative Committee may require or permit;
b.
Shall be available to all active Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis that shall not result in discrimination in favor of Employees who are officers or highly compensated within the meaning of Code section 401; and
c.
Shall be evidenced by a promissory note executed by the Participant which provides for:
(1)
A reasonable rate of interest determined by the Administrative Committee, and
(2)
For repayment through payroll deduction or via check while a Participant is on a leave of absence without sufficient pay (except to the extent loan repayments are suspended in accordance with the loan policy and applicable law):
(i)
Within a specified period of time, which shall not extend beyond five years from the time the loan is made unless the loan proceeds are used to acquire a dwelling, which within a reasonable time is to be used as a principal residence (as determined at the time the loan is made) of the Participant, in which case the promissory note shall provide for repayment within 15 years of the time the loan is made, unless otherwise provided by the Administrative Committee at the time the loan is made, and
(ii)
In substantially equal payments, at least quarterly, over the term of the loan, and
(iii)
Upon such other terms and conditions as the Administrative Committee shall determine.
d.
Shall be administered in accordance with a loan policy adopted by the Administrative Committee.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, including Section 5.25.120, such loan shall be a first lien against the portion of the Participant's Account by which it is secured and any amount of principal or interest due and unpaid thereof shall be deducted insofar as possible from the portion of such Account by which it is secured before the payment of any portion thereof to the Participant or his Beneficiary. A loan shall continue to be repaid pursuant to the terms of the promissory note, even after the loan has defaulted and been reported as a deemed distribution on Form 1099-R, unless and until the loan has been repaid in full, including through offset either: (1) at the time the Participant or Beneficiary requests a distribution, or (2) to the extent provided in the promissory note and loan policy, upon the Participant's death or Separation from Employment.
4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, loans made to Participants under the Plan shall be due and payable upon the Participant's termination of employment with the County, whether by death, retirement or otherwise. Beneficiaries, Alternate Payees and Participants who are not Employees are not eligible for a loan.
5.
To the extent required by law, including, without limitation, guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, Horizons, the Savings Plan and the Deferred Earnings Plan shall be treated as one plan for purposes of this subsection I.
J.
1.
Distributions, Withdrawals or Loans from Core Funds Generally. Except as provided in subsection J.2. of this Section 5.25.080, all Distributions, Withdrawals or Loans must be made from amounts allocated to Core Funds. If the Participant has allocated an insufficient amount to Core Funds for a requested Distribution, Withdrawal, or Loan, the Participant must transfer sufficient amounts from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to Core Funds to enable the requested Distribution, Withdrawal or Loan. The Administrative Committee may reallocate the funds in a Participant's Investment Accounts from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to Core Funds if such action is necessary for the administration of the plan.
2.
Notwithstanding subsection J.1. of this Section 5.25.080, a Participant or Beneficiary may request an in-kind distribution of securities held through the Personal Brokerage Account Window subject to the following requirements: (1) the Participant or Beneficiary must be entitled to receive and must request a full distribution of the Account from both the Core Funds and the Personal Brokerage Account Window, and (2) the in-kind distribution must be made in the form of a direct rollover to an "Eligible Retirement Plan" as authorized in section 5.25.108 and such Eligible Retirement Plan must accept the in-kind rollover.
K.
Amounts rolled over into this Plan may be distributed at any time following the rollover.
(Ord. 2014-0017 § 11, 2014; Ord. 2010-0063 § 7, 2010; Ord. 2009-0040 § 5, 2009; Ord. 2008-0004 § 7, 2008; Ord. 2005-0037 § 6, 2005; Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.085 - Claims procedures.
A.
Initial Claim. Any Participant or Beneficiary who believes that he or she is entitled to receive a benefit under the Plan must file an application as provided in Section 5.25.080A.
B.
Appeal. If an application for benefits is denied, the Participant or Beneficiary will be advised of his or her right to appeal the denial to the Administrative Committee. The Participant or Beneficiary may appeal the denial of his or her application by filing with the Administrative Committee a written request for review of such claim stating the specific facts supporting his or her claim and specifying the remedy sought. The appeal shall be reviewed by Agents of the Administrative Committee. If the Agents determine that the claim is valid, benefits shall be distributed as soon as administratively feasible in accordance with Section 5.25.080. If, however, such Agents recommend denial of the claim, such appeal shall be reviewed by the Administrative Committee at its next open meeting. The determination of the Administrative Committee as to the denial of a claim on appeal shall be final and binding to the extent permitted by law.

G.
Expense Charges to Plan.
1.
Until such time as a different fee is approved by the Administrative Committee, Participants shall be charged a fee of $2.20 per month for Plan administrative expenses covered by this subsection G1. Prior to the beginning of each County fiscal year, the Administrative Committee shall determine the amount of annual fees that it reasonably estimates will be necessary to properly administer the Plan during such fiscal year. For purposes of its determination, the Administrative Committee shall take into account (i) direct, additional County costs expected to be incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions defined in this Section 5.25.090 and (ii) the cost of contractors that provide services to the Plan, including, without limitation, fiduciary and liability insurance coverage, communication consultants, investment advisors, auditors and legal services, pursuant to contracts that are approved by the Board or the Administrative Committee. The expenses subject to this subsection G1 shall not include the cost of TPA fees, Trustee fees and investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds. The expenses incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions defined in this Section 5.25.090 shall not exceed the amount approved by the Board of Supervisors in the County budget. Expenses incurred as a result of contractors performing the Plan functions described in this Section 5.25.090, and the cost of fiduciary and liability insurance, are limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board. Effective the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2003, the annual fees determined under this subsection G1 (including any emergency surcharge assessed by the Administrative Committee pursuant to the last sentence of this subsection) shall not exceed 0.15 percent of the assets of the Plan as of the last day of the month prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the estimated fees are being determined. The annual fees approved by the Administrative Committee may be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the County. The estimated annual fees for the Plan approved by the Administrative Committee pursuant to this subsection G1 will be charged to each Participant's account on a per-capita basis. The per-Participant, annual charge will be determined by dividing the estimated annual fees for the Plan by the number of Participants on the last day of the calendar year prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the fees are being determined. The per-Participant annual charge will be divided by 12 and billed monthly to each Participant's account during the fiscal year. A Participant will be billed only for months in which he or she has an account balance in the Plan. The monthly charges will appear on the Participant's quarterly statement. Employees who become Participants in the Plan during the fiscal year will be charged the same monthly per-Participant charge determined prior to the beginning of the fiscal year by the Administrative Committee. Until such time as the Administrative Committee approves a new annual fee, Participants will be charged the same monthly per-Participant charge as previously set by the Administrative Committee. The Administrative Committee may assess an emergency surcharge to Participant's accounts if it reasonably determines that actual Plan expenses authorized by the subsection will exceed the estimated annual fees determined prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
2.
TPA, Trustee fees, and investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds are limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board. TPA and Trustee fees will be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and will be allocated to the individual Participants' accounts and reflected on quarterly statements. Fees incident to investment in specific Brokerage Investments available through the Personal Brokerage Account Window are not limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board. Investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds shall be periodically charged to the appropriate Investment Fund.
3.
In the event that the Plan accumulates (i) fees in excess of actual administrative expenses, or (ii) unallocated earnings from Plan operations, the Administrative Committee shall allocate excess fees and earnings first by establishing a reserve for contingencies and payment of planned obligations not to exceed 1/2 of the total annual fees (other than TPA fees) charged to Participants, and then by allocating any remainder by reducing TPA fees charged to Participants or other administrative fees paid by the County by a method determined by the Administrative Committee.

B.
Immunities. Except as otherwise provided by the Trust Agreement:

No fiduciary shall be liable for any action taken or not taken with respect to the Plan or the Trust Agreement except for his or her own negligence or willful misconduct except as otherwise provided in subsection 2. of this Section 5.25.095B;
2.
A fiduciary shall be liable for a breach of duty committed by another fiduciary (a "co-fiduciary") only under the following circumstances: (i) where the fiduciary participates in the breach of duty committed by a co-fiduciary, (ii) where the fiduciary improperly delegates its duties to a co-fiduciary, (iii) where the fiduciary approves, knowingly acquiesces in, or conceals a breach of duty committed by a co-fiduciary, (iv) where the fiduciary negligently enables a co-fiduciary to commit a breach of duty, or (v) where the fiduciary fails to take reasonable steps to compel a co-fiduciary to redress a breach of duty if the fiduciary knows of, or has information from which he or she reasonably should have known of, the breach of duty.
3.
The County and each officer and Employee thereof, the Administrative Committee and each member thereof, and any other person to whom the County or Administrative Committee delegates (or the Plan or Trust Agreement assigns) any duty with respect to the Plan or the Trust Agreement, may rely and shall be fully protected in acting in good faith upon the advice of counsel, who may be counsel for the County, upon the records of the County, upon the opinion, certificate, valuation, report, recommendation, or determination of the TPA, the Trustee, and Investment Manager, the County Treasurer or of the County Auditor-Controller, or upon any certificate, statement or other representation made by or any information furnished by an Employee, a Participant, a Beneficiary or the Trustee concerning any fact required to be determined under any of the provisions of the Plan;
4.
If any responsibility of a fiduciary is allocated to another person, then, except to the extent provided in subsection 2. of this Section 5.25.095B, such fiduciary shall not be responsible for any act or omission of such person in carrying out such responsibility; and
5.
No fiduciary shall have the duty to discharge any duty, function or responsibility which is assigned by the terms of the Plan or Trust Agreement or delegated pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.25.090 to another person.

5.25.100 - Temporary suspension of plan provisions.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, during any conversion period (including but not limited to a change of Trustee, TPA or Investment Funds or a plan merger or spin-off), in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee, the Administrative Committee may temporarily suspend, in whole or in part, certain provisions of the Plan, which may include, but are not limited to, a Participant's right to change his contribution election, a Participant's right to change his investment direction and a Participant's right to borrow or withdraw from his Account or obtain a distribution from his Account.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.105 - Merger of deferred compensation and thrift plans.
Effective on October 1, 1991 (the "Merger Date"), the County Deferred Compensation Plan originally established in Chapter 5.24 of the County Code was merged into the County Thrift Plan originally established by this Chapter 5.25, and the merged plan was retitled the "Deferred Compensation and Thrift Plan" (the "Merged Plan"). The resultant Merged Plan is a continuation of both plans and shall not be construed as a termination of either plan. Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapters 5.24 and 5.25, the following provisions shall apply to the plan merger:
A.
Any person who was a Participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan as of the Merger Date is deemed to be an Eligible Employee for purposes of participation in the Merged Plan and shall become a Participant in the Merged Plan as of the Merger Date.

Subject to the deferral limits required by Section 5.25.040 and until later modified or terminated by the Participant, (i) Participation Agreements of a Participant in the Deferred Compensation or Thrift Plans that are in effect on the Merger Date shall remain in effect in the Merged Plan, and (ii) the Deferred Compensation Contributions of a Participant on and after the Merger Date shall be the sum of the deferrals elected by the Participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Thrift Plan and the Merged Plan.
C.
The account balance credited to the Deferred Account of each Participant of the Deferred Compensation Plan as of midnight on September 30, 1991, shall be transferred to the Participant's Deferred Account in the Merged Plan as of the Merger Date.

F.
Distributions from the Deferred Compensation Plan which commence or are approved to commence before the Merger Date shall continue or commence, as the case may be, pursuant to the distribution provisions and procedures of the Deferred Compensation Plan. Distributions from the Merged Plan which are approved on or after the Merger Date shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.25.080 of the Merged Plan.
G.
Effective on the Merger Date, the Deferred Compensation and Thrift Plan Administrative Committee shall assume the authority, responsibilities and contractual obligations of the Deferred Compensation Plan Administrative Committee.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.108 - Rollovers and Plan-to-Plan Transfers.
A.
Transfers from the Pension Savings Plan. As provided by the County Pension Savings Plan, the County Pension Savings Plan membership and Investment Account of any full-time permanent County employee, who becomes a member of the Los Angeles County Employees' Retirement Association ("LACERA"), meets the eligibility requirements of this Plan and then elects to become a Participant of this Plan by entering into a Participation Agreement and agreeing to make Deferred Compensation Contributions to this Plan, shall be transferred to this Plan (the "Transfer"). Furthermore, as provided by the County Pension Savings Plan, the administrative committee of that plan at its sole discretion may transfer the County Pension Savings Plan membership and Investment Account of any full-time permanent County employee, who becomes a member of the Los Angeles County Employees' Retirement Association (LACERA), to this Plan (the "Nonelective Participant"). Notwithstanding any other provisions of Chapter 5.25, the following provisions shall apply to the employees affected by the Transfer:
1.
The account balance credited to the Investment Account of each Participant of the Pension Savings Plan shall be transferred to the Participant's Deferred Account in this Plan effective on the Entry Date into this Plan. Investments in the Participant's "Investment Account" under the Pension Savings Plan shall be liquidated and then the cash shall be transferred to this Plan within a commercially reasonable period of time, unless the Administrative Committee otherwise makes arrangements for an in-kind transfer of assets. The Participant's account balance under this Plan immediately after the transfer shall be at least equal to the total amount of the Participant's accounts under the Pension Savings Plan immediately before the transfer. Each Participant may instruct the Trustee or TPA, as applicable, to allocate the transferred cash among the Investment Funds in accordance with the terms of this Plan. The Administrative Committee shall invest Plan assets for Nonelective Participants and for which no Participant investment instructions are received.
2.
All County Pension Savings Plan Deferred Compensation Contributions and Matching Contributions earned by any Participant of that plan in the month preceding the Transfer due to be contributed for the Participant to the County Pension Savings Plan on or after the Entry Date into this Plan shall instead be contributed to this Plan. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, the reference to "month" in this Section 5.25.108A.2 shall be deemed to be a reference to "payroll period."
3.
Distributions of amounts transferred to this Plan shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.25.080 of this Plan.
4.
A Nonelective Participant shall be a Participant of the Plan in every sense, except that no Deferred Compensation Contributions or Matching Contributions shall be made under this Plan for a Nonelective Participant until such Participant enters into a Participation Agreement to make contributions to this Plan.
B.
Rollovers into Horizons from Other Eligible Retirement Plans.
1.
Effective on or after September 1, 2003, the Trustee or its authorized agent shall, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, receive and thereafter hold and administer as part of the Accounts for a Participant all cash and other property that constitute an Eligible Rollover Distribution if such Eligible Rollover Distribution is either (i) received in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, or (ii) transferred by the Participant to the Trustee or its authorized agent on or before the 60th day after he received such Eligible Rollover Distribution (a "Rollover Contribution"). The Plan will accept an Eligible Rollover Distribution that is attributable to the Participant's status as a surviving spouse.
2.
The Administrative Committee may take any action and may require the Participant to provide any information or documentation necessary to permit the Administrative Committee to satisfy any obligation imposed on the Administrative Committee by the Code and the regulations thereunder to make a reasonable determination that the Eligible Rollover Distribution satisfies the requirements of the Code and the terms of the Plan. The Committee may instruct the Trustee or its authorized agent not to accept the contribution if it does not satisfy such requirements or if it would otherwise jeopardize the eligible status of the Plan.
3.
An Eligible Rollover Distribution received by the Plan shall be held in the Participant's Rollover Account, including any record-keeping subaccounts established under 5.25.020QQ, and invested in accordance with the Participant's instructions in accordance with Sections 5.25.070
C.
Rollovers from Horizons.
1.
Effective for any distribution made on or after January 1, 2002, a Participant who is entitled to receive an Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Plan, may direct the Administrative Committee to have the distribution transferred in a lump sum directly to the trustee of an Eligible Retirement Plan, as defined in 5.25.020W, that permits the acceptance of rollover contributions. A direct rollover from the Plan will be offered only for distributions that would be Eligible Rollover Distributions without regard to Code section 401(a)(9)(H).
2.
In order for a transfer to be made with respect to a Participant under this subsection C, (a) the Participant must designate in writing the Eligible Retirement Plan to receive the transferred amounts; (b) the Participant must timely provide the Administrative Committee with adequate information to enable the Administrative Committee to determine that the transferee plan is an Eligible Retirement Plan; (c) the entire amount to be transferred must be an Eligible Rollover Distribution; (d) the Participant must have received proper notice in accordance with Code section 402(f); and (e) in the case of a distribution of property other than money, the amount so transferred consists of the property distributed.
3.
A Participant's surviving spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution on the Participant's death under Section 5.25.080B of the Plan or an Alternate Payee who is a Participant's spouse or former spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution under Section 5.25.125 of the Plan shall be treated as the Participant for the purposes of this subsection C. Additionally, a Participant's surviving Beneficiary who is not a spouse and becomes eligible to receive a distribution on the Participant's death under Section 5.25.080B of the Plan, may elect a direct trustee-to-trustee rollover to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity (as defined in Code section 408) established to receive such distribution in accordance with Code section 402(c)(11).
D.
Trustee-to-trustee Transfers to Purchase Permissive Service Credit and as Repayment of Contributions and Interest.
1.
Effective on or after January 1, 2002, a Participant may direct the Administrative Committee to make a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer of all or part of the Participant's Investment Accounts to a defined benefit governmental plan (as defined in Code section 414(d)) in California if such transfer is (a) for the purchase of permissive service credit (as defined in section 415(n)(3)(A)) under such defined benefit governmental plan, or (b) a repayment of contributions (including interest thereon) to such defined benefit governmental plan with respect to an amount previously refunded upon a forfeiture of service credit under the plan or under another governmental plan maintained by a State or local government employer to which Code section 415 does not apply by reason of Code section 415(k)(3).
2.
The Administrative Committee may take any action and may require the Participant to provide any information or documentation necessary to permit the Administrative Committee to satisfy any obligation imposed on the Administrative Committee by the Code and the regulations thereunder to make a reasonable determination that the trustee-to-trustee transfer satisfies the requirements of the Code and the terms of the Plan and will be accepted by the transferee plan.
E.
Transfers to or from Comparable Plans.
1.
If a Participant undergoes a Separation from Employment in order to accept employment with another eligible governmental employer (within the meaning of Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code) which sponsors an "eligible deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 457(b) of the Code, then that Participant may make an election not to have the vested amounts credited to such Participant's Investment Accounts distributed, but instead to have such amounts transferred to the "eligible deferred compensation plan" of the new employer of such Participant, provided that (a) the transferee plan specifically authorizes the acceptance of such transferred amounts, (b) the Participant's account balance under the transferee plan immediately after the transfer is at least equal to the total amount of the Participant's Investment Accounts immediately before the transfer, and (c) the Participant is performing services for the eligible governmental employer maintaining the transferee plan.
2.
In the event that a Participant has entered County service after having been a Participant in another "eligible deferred compensation plan" maintained by another eligible governmental employer (within the meaning of Code section 457(e)(1)(A)), the Trustee will accept a transfer of funds from such other plan for credit to such Participant's Deferred Account provided that the foregoing transfer requirements are met.
3.
The Administrative Committee may require such documentation from a predecessor or successor plan as it deems necessary to assure that such plan is sponsored by another eligible governmental employer and the transfer meets the other requirements of this section and the law. A Participant's Investment Accounts may not be transferred to and the Plan may not accept a transfer of amounts from an eligible deferred compensation plan that does not comply with Code section 457(g) or a successor provision (relating to holding the assets of the plan in trust for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries).
(Ord. 2014-0017 § 13, 2014; Ord. 2010-0014, § 6, 2010; Ord. 2009-0040 § 8, 2009; Ord. 2008-0004 § 8, 2008; Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.110 - Amendment or termination of plan.
A.
Generally. Except as provided in Section 5.25.110B, the Plan may be amended or terminated by the County at any time. No amendment or termination of the Plan shall reduce or impair the rights of any Participant or Beneficiary to the vested interest in their Investment Accounts. In the event that the Plan is terminated by the County and there is a successor plan, the Trustee shall transfer the Plan assets to the successor plan as provided by the successor plan document. Any such transfer shall be consistent with law and any successor plan must be sponsored by an eligible governmental employer (within the meaning of Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code) and be an "eligible deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 457(b) of the Code. In the event that the Plan is terminated by the County and there is no successor plan, the Trustee shall distribute as soon as administratively practical to each Participant or his or her Beneficiary in a lump sum payment the vested balance in such Participant's Investment Accounts in accordance with Section 5.25.080 of the Plan and Code section 457(d).
B.
Represented Employees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.25.110A above, with respect to Represented Employees, the termination of the Plan or the amendment of any Plan provisions that are subject to negotiation shall be negotiated with representatives of the Represented Employees.
C.
Vested Contractual Rights. Because the Plan is subject to amendment and termination as set forth herein, neither participation in the Plan nor eligibility therefor shall entitle any employee to have the Plan or any specific terms thereof continued in the future.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.115 - Electronic media.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, including provisions requiring the use of a written instrument, the Administrative Committee may establish procedures for the use of electronic media in communications and transactions between the Plan or the Administrative Committee and Participants and Beneficiaries; provided, however, that any such procedures shall comply with applicable law. Electronic media may include, but are not limited to e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and automated, telephonic voice-response systems.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.120 - Nonalienation.
To the extent permitted by law and except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no right or interest of any kind of a Participant or Beneficiary hereunder shall be transferable or assignable by the Participant or Beneficiary, nor shall any such right or interest be subject to alienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind, voluntary or involuntary.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.125 - Rights of an alternate payee under a QDRO.
A.
Notwithstanding Section 5.25.120, an Alternate Payee shall have the right to make a claim for any benefits awarded to the Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO as provided in this section. If an Alternate Payee is awarded a specified interest in the Accounts of the Participant pursuant to a QDRO, such interest of the Alternate Payee shall be segregated and separately accounted for by the Trustee in the name and for the benefit of the Alternate Payee.
B.
Upon receipt of a domestic relations order, or, if earlier, written notice that a domestic relations order may be sought, the Administrative Committee shall suspend distributions from the Participant's Investment Accounts, and shall take steps to ensure that the Participant and each Alternate Payee is aware of the order or proposed order and the suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Accounts. Moreover, the Administrative Committee shall determine, within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, whether such order is a QDRO. If the order is determined to be a QDRO, the Alternate Payee's interest under such order shall be segregated and/or distributed in accordance with the QDRO and this Section 5.25.125. The suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Account shall be discontinued only in accordance with a QDRO, a court order demonstrating that no benefits have been awarded to the Alternate Payee, or other documentation as determined by the Plan Administrator.
C.
Distributions to the Alternate Payee shall be made in accordance with the QDRO provided that the QDRO does not provide for distributions earlier than permitted by Code section 457(d) or otherwise conflict with the Plan's distribution provisions or the provisions of this Section. On or after September 1, 2003, regardless of whether the Participant is eligible to take a distribution under the Plan, the QDRO may provide (or may be amended to provide) for an immediate distribution of the Alternate Payee's interest thereunder to the Alternate Payee. If a QDRO does not provide the form of distribution of benefits payable to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee shall have the right to elect distribution in any form provided under this Section. Pursuant to the QDRO or the Alternate Payee's election, the Alternate Payee's interest may be distributed in cash in a lump sum payment or in equal monthly, quarterly or annual installments not extending over more than fifteen years.
D.
Segregation of Alternate Payee's Interest.
1.
Generally, the Alternate Payee's interest specified in the QDRO shall be segregated and/or distributed from the Participant's Accounts, and the Core Funds in which such Accounts are invested, on a pro rata basis. If the assets invested in the Core Funds are insufficient to satisfy the QDRO, the Administrative Committee may transfer amounts from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to the Core Funds as necessary.
2.
Notwithstanding subsection D.1. of this Section 5.25.125, a QDRO may provide for an in-kind division and/or distribution of securities held through the Personal Brokerage Account Window subject to the following requirements: (1) the Alternate Payee is the Participant's former spouse, (2) the QDRO clearly states the number of shares and the identities of the securities awarded to the Alternate Payee; and (3) either: (a) if the amounts are remaining in the Alternate Payee's Account under the Plan, the Alternate Payee must enter his own contract with the Broker to open a brokerage account through the Personal Brokerage Account Window, or (b) if the amounts are to be distributed in-kind, the Alternate Payee must request, or the QDRO must provide for, a full distribution of the Alternate Payee's Account from both Core Funds and the Personal Brokerage Account Window and the distribution must be made in the form of a direct rollover to an "Eligible Retirement Plan" as authorized in section 5.25.108 and such Eligible Retirement Plan must accept the in-kind rollover.
E.
Following the determination that a domestic relations order is a QDRO, and segregation of an Alternate Payee's interest, the Alternate Payee shall have the right to direct the investment of his or her interest in the same manner as provided under Section 5.25.070 with respect to the Participant. The Participant shall continue to have the right to direct the investment of the portion of his or her Accounts that is not awarded to the Alternate Payee pursuant to the QDRO.
F.
Unless the QDRO provides otherwise, an Alternate Payee shall have the right, in the same manner as a Participant, to designate a Beneficiary, who shall receive benefits payable to the Alternate Payee in the event that all of the Alternate Payee's benefits have not been distributed at the time of the Alternate Payee's death. If the Alternate Payee does not designate a Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary predeceases the Alternate Payee, benefits payable to the Alternate Payee which have not been distributed shall be paid to the Alternate Payee's estate. Any death benefits payable under this section shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the Alternate Payee's death and as soon as permissible in accordance with Code section 457(d), with or without the Beneficiary's request.
G.
Unless the QDRO provides otherwise, an Alternate Payee shall have the right, in the same manner as a Participant, to apply for an Emergency Withdrawal pursuant to 5.25.080E.

Whenever any Participant entitled to Benefits under the Plan shall be under a legal disability or, in the sole judgment of the Administrative Committee, shall otherwise be unable to apply Benefits to his own best interest and advantage, the Trustee, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, may make payments to the Participant's legal representative, and the decision of the Administrative Committee shall completely discharge the liability of the Plan, the Administrative Committee, the County and the Trustee with respect to such benefits.

5.25.135 - No enlargement of employment rights.
By accepting benefits under the Plan, a Participant does not thereby agree to continue for any period in the employ of the County, and the County by adopting the Plan, making contributions thereto or taking any action with respect to the Plan does not obligate itself to continue the employment of any Participant for any period.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)

5.25.150 - Trial court entities.
Generally effective January 1, 2001, the Trial Court Act recognizes the Trial Court Entities as separate, successor employers for certain purposes, and provides that, if permitted by federal law, Trial Court Employees shall continue to be eligible to receive deferred compensation benefits under the Plan unless otherwise elected by their respective Trial Court Entities. Accordingly, if Trial Court Employees participate in the Plan on and after January 1, 2001, then, on and after that date, the applicable Trial Court Entity shall be a participating employer in the Plan and any Participation Agreement in effect for such Trial Court Employees shall be deemed to be made under a separate agreement with the Trial Court Entity that employs them, and any County contributions made to the Plan on behalf of such Trial Court Employees shall be paid out of the budget of their respective Trial Court Entity.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)

Except to the extent federal law controls, the Plan shall be governed, construed and administered according to the laws of the State of California. All persons accepting or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be bound by and deemed to consent to its provisions.
(Ord. 2003-0057 § 2 (part), 2003.)
5.25.165 - Cessation of contributions upon ceasing to be an Eligible Employee; Exception for Special Eligible Employees.
Under existing Plan rules, a Participant who ceases to be an Eligible Employee may no longer be covered by a Participation Agreement and thus may not have Deferred Compensation Contributions or Matching Contributions made for him or her until he or she again commences participation pursuant to Section 5.25.030. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective December 1, 1993, a Special Eligible Employee may continue to have Deferred Compensation and Matching Contributions made for him or her provided that no Deferred Compensation Contributions or Matching Contributions will be made on behalf of any Special Eligible Employee for services performed after March 31, 2004 until he or she again commences participation pursuant to Section 5.25.030
