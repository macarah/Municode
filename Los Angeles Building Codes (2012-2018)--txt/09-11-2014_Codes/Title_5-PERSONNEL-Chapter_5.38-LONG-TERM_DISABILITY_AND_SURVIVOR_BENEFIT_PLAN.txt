Because of the employee's refusal to accept rehabilitation; provided, however, that other income benefits, for purposes of this Plan, shall not include any cost-of-living adjustments applicable to benefits payable under the Federal Social Security Act subsequent to the commencement date of such benefits. If the eligible employee is eligible for both retirement benefits and disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act and receives retirement benefits in lieu of disability benefits, other income benefits shall include the amount of such retirement benefits.
3.
The Amount of Retirement Benefit that the Employee Receives under Retirement Plan A, B, C, D, or G. For purposes of this paragraph, such retirement benefits shall not include any cost of living adjustments granted subsequent to the date any benefits become payable under this Plan. In the event a disability beneficiary or deceased employee was eligible for retirement benefits under Retirement Plan A, B, C, D, or G but was not receiving such benefits, any such benefits that he or she would have received shall be estimated by the Chief Executive Officer for purposes of calculating any benefit due under this Plan.

F.
Return to Work Part-Time. An eligible employee or disability beneficiary may return to county employment of a part-time basis pursuant to a program approved by the chief executive officer and may receive disability benefit payments during the period of such employment; provided, however, that 70 percent of any salary, compensation, or income earned under such arrangement shall be subtracted from the basic monthly benefit.

5.38.030 - Claims.
A.
Claim Forms. The county shall furnish the claimant with the appropriate forms for applying for benefits and for filing proof of disability. If such forms are requested by the employee and not furnished in a timely manner by the county, the employee shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements for filing application for benefits under this Plan provided a written notice is submitted covering the occurrence and the character and the extent of the disability for which a claim is made within the period of time provided in this Plan for applying for benefits.
B.
Application for Benefits. Application for disability benefits must be filed with the county within five months after the first day of absence due to total disability or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. However, in the event application is not made within one year from the first day of absence due to the claimed disability, the qualifying period otherwise provided for in this Plan shall be extended by one day for each day the application is delayed beyond one year from the first day of absence due to total disability unless the employee's disability precludes submission of an application within said one year, in which case, the one year deadline may be extended by the CEO or his designee. Consideration of such extension by the CEO or his designee is contingent upon the provision of an application and all required medical documentation as soon as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no benefits shall be paid under this Plan if application is not made within two years from the first day of absence due to Total Disability, provided, however, that the CEO or its designee may, in its sole discretion, extend the 30-month deadline if the CEO or its designee determines that extension of the deadline is warranted due to equitable considerations. In addition, the employee shall be required to apply for disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act and to provide the county with verification of such application within 30 days after applying for disability benefits under this Plan.
C.
Proof of Disability. Written proof covering the occurrence, the character, and the extent of disability must be furnished to the county within 90 days after an application for benefits has been filed. Failure to furnish proof within the time required will not invalidate or reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within such time; provided, that proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible. However, a day-for-day penalty period will be extended to the six-month qualifying waiting period for each day the claim is not completed under this Plan in the event the required Evidence of Disability is not furnished within:
1.
One year from the first day of absence, however, the qualifying period otherwise provided for in this Plan shall be extended by one day for each day the proof of disability is delayed beyond one year from the first day of absence due to Total Disability unless the employee's disability precludes submission of an application within said one year, in which case, the one year deadline may be extended by the CEO or his designee. Consideration of such extension by the CEO or his designee is contingent upon the provision of an application and all required medical documentation as soon as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no benefits shall be paid under this Plan if application is not made within two years from the first day of absence, provided, however, that the CEO or its designee may, in its sole discretion, extend the 30-month deadline if the CEO or its designee determines that extension of the deadline is warranted due to equitable considerations, due to Total Disability; or
2.
In the case of an individual claiming a disability as a consequence of active military service during a military leave of absence, within such longer period as may be authorized by the Chief Executive Officer. For purposes of this subsection C, "Active Military Service" shall mean Active Military Service as defined in Section 6.20.080 of this Code.
D.
Medical Examination. The county may require such additional proof, as is deemed necessary, including a medical examination at county expense to determine the existence, cause and extent of any injury or sickness which is the basis for a claim for plan benefits.
E.
Determination.
1.
If the proof received shows to the satisfaction of the chief executive officer, that an employee is totally disabled, the basic monthly disability benefit shall become payable to be effective as of the expiration of the qualifying period.
2.
Total disability shall in all cases be determined by the chief executive officer, except that any final decision of the Social Security Administration concerning a claim for disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties.
3.
If the chief executive officer determines after medical examination that an eligible employee or a disability beneficiary is not totally disabled, no disability benefit shall be payable.
F.
Appeal. A claimant may appeal, within the established time frames, the denial, cessation, or cancellation of a benefit under this Plan by filing a written notice of appeal with the Claims Administrator, together with any pertinent supporting medical documentation. The Claims Administrator shall conduct a full and fair evaluation of the appeal and render a decision. In accordance with the procedures established for such purpose in the Plan Information, the claimant may file a written request for a hearing regarding a denial of benefits by the Claims Administrator. The matter shall then be reviewed by a hearing officer designated by the CEO. The hearing officer shall conduct a full and fair hearing and render a decision, which shall be final. If the employee's disability precludes submission of medical documentation within the established time frames, the deadline for the appeal may be extended by the CEO or his designee. Consideration of such extension is contingent upon the provision of the medical documentation as soon as reasonably possible.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no benefits shall be payable if such benefits are not permitted pursuant to state or federal law.
2.
If the survivor benefit is to be paid to surviving children, then the benefit shall be divided among such children in equal amounts; provided, however, that the right of any such child to share in the benefits shall cease upon his or her death, marriage, or upon attaining the age of 18 years. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the benefit otherwise payable to the children of the deceased employee or deceased disability beneficiary shall be paid to such children through the age of 21 years if such children remain unmarried and are regularly enrolled as full-time students in an accredited school as determined by the chief executive officer.

In the event the deceased employee or disability beneficiary was not receiving Social Security disability benefits, the amount of such benefits the employee or disability beneficiary would have received, if otherwise eligible, shall be estimated for the purpose of computing the benefit provided by this section. The chief executive officer, upon actuarial advice, shall establish and adjust annually, if required, the table of estimated Social Security disability benefits which shall be utilized in computing the survivor benefits.
C.
Should the surviving spouse or domestic partner fail to cooperate with the County for a period of 90 days, the benefit shall be payable to the surviving children of the deceased employee or deceased disability beneficiary who otherwise meet all eligibility requirements. In the event that the survivor benefit is paid to the surviving children, duplicate payment for the same period shall not subsequently be payable to a surviving spouse or domestic partner.
