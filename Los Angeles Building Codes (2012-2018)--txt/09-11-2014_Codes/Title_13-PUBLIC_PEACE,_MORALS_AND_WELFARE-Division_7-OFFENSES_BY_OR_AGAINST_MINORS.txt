Chapter 13.59 - REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS

A.
On November 7, 2006, the voters of the State of California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 83, the Sexual Predator Punishment and Control Act, commonly referred to as Jessica's Law, so as to better protect Californians, and in particular, to protect the children of California from sex offenders;
B.
Proposition 83, as codified in subsection (b) of California Penal Code section 3003.5, prohibits any person who is required to register as a sex offender under Penal Code section 290 (hereinafter referred to as a "registered sex offender") from residing within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or any park where children regularly gather;
C.
Proposition 83, as codified in subsection (c) of Penal Code section 3003.5, authorizes local governments to enact ordinances that further restrict the residency of any registered sex offender;
D.
Subsection (a) of Penal Code section 3003.5, enacted in 1998 prior to Proposition 83, prohibits registered sex offenders who are on parole from residing in a "single-family dwelling" with another registered sex offender during the parole period, unless those persons are legally related by blood, marriage, or adoption. For purposes of this state statute, "single-family dwelling" does not include a residential facility such as a group home that serves six or fewer persons;
E.
There are approximately 1438 registered sex offenders in the unincorporated areas of the County of Los Angeles ("County") and approximately 397 of these registered sex offenders are on parole;
F.
The County is concerned with recent occurrences within the County and elsewhere in California where multiple registered sex offenders have been residing together in violation of Penal Code section 3003.5;
G.
By enacting Chapter 13.59, the County intends to eliminate any potential conflict of land uses in residential neighborhoods and to reduce the potential dangers associated with multiple registered sex offenders living near families with children and places where children frequently gather. Chapter 13.59 also regulates the number of registered sex offenders permitted to reside in multiple family dwellings;
H.
In addition to public and private schools and local parks, the County further finds that other public places that children frequently gather, such as child care centers, should also be protected from registered sex offenders;
I.
In order to foster compliance with the intent of this ordinance, Chapter 13.59 also establishes regulations for property owners who rent residential facilities to registered sex offenders;
J.
Based on County data, once this ordinance becomes effective, there will be 120 remaining square miles within the County's residential zones where registered sex offenders can still reside; and
K.
This ordinance is required for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety of the citizens of the County.
