Part 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sections:

5.26.010 - Adoption—Purpose.
The County of Los Angeles, pursuant to the order of its Board of Supervisors, adopted a profit sharing plan known as "The County of Los Angeles Savings Plan," effective as of September 1, 1984. The Plan was amended and restated generally effective as of January 1, 1997, to comply with the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992, the requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Effective May 30, 2008, the County amends this Plan to reflect the merger of the Los Angeles County Deferred Earnings Plan, as originally established and maintained under Chapter 5.23 of the Los Angeles County Code ("Deferred Earnings Plan") into this Plan.
The Plan is a profit sharing plan with a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) and to meet the requirements of Code Section 401(k). The purpose of the Plan is to permit Employees to defer a portion of their Compensation and provide for retirement, disability and death benefits. The Plan is a retirement benefit enhancement provided to Employees subsequent to the withdrawal of the County from the Social Security System effective December 31, 1982.
While the County intends to continue the plan, it reserves the right to amend and/or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time. Benefits under the Plan shall at any time be limited to those that are payable from Participants' Accounts to the extent then funded by County Contributions that have already been made and credited to such Accounts. Therefore, while Participants' existing Account balances are at all times fully protected, neither participation in the Plan nor eligibility therefore shall entitle any Employee to have the Plan or any of its provisions continued for his benefit in the future.

Except as provided in Part 4.5, 415 Compensation shall not include any Settlement Award (as defined in Part 4.5). In order to be taken into account as 415 Compensation, an item of compensation must be paid (or treated as paid) to the Participant prior to the Participant's Severance Date, provided, however, the following types of post-employment payments are included within 415 Compensation if they are paid by the later of 2½ months after the Participant's Severance Date or the end of the calendar year in which such Severance Date occurs: (i) payments that, absent a termination from employment, would have been paid to the Participant in the normal course of employment and are regular compensation for services during regular working hours or outside regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), bonuses or other similar compensation; and (ii) Termination Pay.

Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, 415 Compensation shall not include Nonelective Contributions (as that term is defined in Los Angeles County Code Sections 5.27.020, 5.28.020, 5.33.020 or 5.37.020, as applicable) unless those Nonelective Contributions are received by the Participant as a cash benefit under the Choices, Options, Flexible Benefit or Mega-Flex Plans (in accordance with Los Angeles County Code Sections 5.27.050E, 5.28.050E, 5.33.050F or 5.37.050F, as applicable).

B.
For calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the amount of Tax Deferred Contributions pursuant to a Participant's Compensation Deferral Agreement for any calendar year shall not exceed the following applicable dollar amounts: (a) $11,000 in 2002, (b) $12,000 in 2003, (c) $13,000 in 2004, (d) $14,000 in 2005, and (e) $15,000 in 2006 and thereafter.

The dollar limits set out in this Section 5.26.100B constitute the "Deferral Limits" for such applicable calendar year. Catch-Up Contributions made pursuant to Section 5.26.060B and Code Section 414(v) are not taken into consideration for purposes of determining the Deferral Limit for a calendar year. This subsection B shall not apply to any Participant who elects, pursuant to a Compensation Deferral Agreement or in accordance with the procedures of Sections 5.26.080 or 5.26.090, to be subject to the Combined Limit as defined in subsection C of this Section 5.26.100 or is treated as having so elected pursuant to Section 5.26.100C.

For calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, any Participant who also participates in the Horizons Plan and elects to be covered by this subsection C (or is treated as having so elected) shall be subject to the following combined limit: The combined Deferral Limit as determined under Section 5.26.100A for the 2001 calendar year shall apply to the aggregate for the calendar year of the Participant's Tax Deferred Contributions under this Plan and the Participant's contributions (both "Deferred Compensation Contributions" and "Matching Contributions") under the Horizons Plan. The dollar limits provided for in this Section 5.26.100C constitute the "Combined Limit" for such applicable calendar year. Any Participant who elects to be covered by this subsection C (or is treated as having so elected) will be precluded from making any catch-up contributions under Code Section 414(v) to this Plan or Horizons for such calendar year. This subsection C shall not apply to any Participant who elects, pursuant to a Compensation Deferral Agreement, or in accordance with the procedures of Sections 5.26.080 or 5.26.090, to be subject to the Deferral Limit under subsection B of this Section 5.26.100. Any Participant who as of December 31, 2001 also participated in Horizons shall be treated as having elected to be covered by the Combined Limit under Section 5.26.100C until such time as the Participant elects, in accordance with the procedures of Sections 5.26.080 and 5.26.090, to be subject to the Deferral Limits under Section 5.26.100B.
D.
If, for any calendar year, the amount of the Tax Deferred Contributions pursuant to a Participant's Compensation Deferral Agreement does exceed the Deferral Limit, the excess amount of such Tax Deferred Contributions shall be distributed to the Participant in cash no later than April 15th of the next following calendar year (together with any earnings thereon through the end of the calendar year in which the contribution was made).
E.
For calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the amount of Tax Deferred Contributions treated as Catch-Up Contributions for any calendar year shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the following applicable dollar amounts: (1) $1,000 in 2002, (2) $2,000 in 2003, (3) $3,000 in 2004, (4) $4,000 in 2005, and (5) $5,000 in 2006 and thereafter; or (b) the excess, if any, of the Participant's 415 Compensation over any other elective deferrals made by the Participant for such year (other than catch-up contributions made pursuant to Code Section 414(v)). For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, the $5,000 applicable dollar limit shall be adjusted for the calendar year to reflect the increases in cost-of-living in accordance with Code Sections 414(v) and 415(d).
F.
For the purposes of applying the Deferral Limit: 1) elective deferrals within the meaning of Code Section 402(g)(3) under any other plan, contract or arrangement of the County shall be treated as made under this Plan; and 2) the "County" includes any entity the employees of which, together with employees of the County, are required to be treated as if they were employed by a single employer under Code Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o).

Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the Trust Agreement, the County shall contribute to the Investment Funds on account each month an amount equal to four percent (4%) of each Participant's monthly Compensation provided that the year-to-date cumulative Matching Contributions do not exceed such Participant's year-to-date cumulative Tax Deferred Contributions. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date, the reference to "month" in this Section 5.26.110.A shall be deemed to be a reference to "payroll period" and the reference to "monthly Compensation" shall be deemed to be a reference to "Compensation for that payroll period." Effective April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, notwithstanding the foregoing, no Matching Contribution will be made for a payroll period after the Participant's Severance Date for which he has no Eligible Earnings.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or the Horizons Plan, including the limitation in subsection A, for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002, when a Participant of this Plan who is also a participant of the Horizons Plan makes the maximum tax deferred contributions permitted by the Code to both plans during a Plan Year, such Participant shall be entitled to have contributed as additional Matching Contributions to this Plan the difference between (1) the total Matching Contributions that would have been made to both plans for such Participant, but for the applicable Deferral Limit described in Section 5.26.100A, and (2) the total Matching Contributions actually made to both plans, provided that the total contributions to this Plan shall not exceed the total contributions allowed by Section 415 of the Code.
C.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, including the limitation in subsection A, when a Participant of this Plan, who makes no contributions to the Horizons Plan during a Plan Year, makes the maximum Tax Deferred Contributions permitted by the code to this Plan during the same Plan Year, such Participant shall be entitled to have contributed as additional Matching Contributions to this Plan the difference between (1) the total Matching Contributions that would have been made for such Participant to this Plan, but for the applicable Deferral Limit described in Section 5.26.100A or B, and (2) the total Matching Contributions actually made to this Plan, provided that the total contributions to this Plan shall not exceed the total contributions allowed by Section 415 of the code.
D.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or the Horizons Plan, including the limitation in subsection A, for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, when a Participant of this Plan who is also a participant of the Horizons Plan (i) has elected to be covered by Section 5.26.100B, (ii) makes the maximum contributions permitted by the code under the Horizons Plan, and (iii) is making Tax Deferred Contributions to this Plan at a rate that will permit the Participant to receive the full Matching Contribution under Section 5.26.110A of this Plan, such Participant shall be entitled to have contributed as additional Matching Contributions to this Plan the difference between (1) the total Matching Contributions that would have been made to both plans for such Participant, but for the applicable limitation under Code Section 457(c) and the Deferral Limit described in Section 5.26.100B, and (2) the total Matching Contributions actually made to both plans, provided that the total Tax Deferred Contributions and Matching Contributions to this Plan shall not exceed the total contributions allowed by Section 415 of the code.
E.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or the Horizons Plan, including the limitation in subsection A, for Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, when a Participant of this Plan who is also a participant in the Horizons Plan has elected to be covered by Section 5.26.100C (or is treated as having so elected) and makes tax deferred contributions to both plans equal to the Combined Limit under this Plan, such Participant shall be entitled to have contributed as additional Matching Contributions to this Plan the difference between (1) the total Matching Contributions that would have been made to both plans for such Participant, but for the Combined Limit described in Section 5.26.100C, and (2) the total Matching Contributions actually made to both plans, provided that the total Tax Deferred Contributions and Matching Contributions to this Plan shall not exceed the total contributions allowed by Section 415 of the code.
F.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) no Matching Contributions shall be made by the County with regard to Tax Deferred Contributions made with respect to payroll periods starting January 1, 2011 and continuing through June 30, 2011; and (ii) the County shall contribute to the Investment Funds on account with respect to each payroll period starting July 1, 2011 and continuing through June 30, 2012, an amount equal to three percent (3%) of each Participant's Compensation for that payroll period provided that the year-to-date cumulative Matching Contributions do not exceed such Participant's year-to-date cumulative Tax Deferred Contributions. The aggregate amount of Matching Contributions under the Plan for such July 1st to June 30th period shall not exceed a dollar cap to be determined by the Board of Supervisors. This subsection D shall not apply to Trial Court Employees or judges, who shall continue to receive Matching Contributions pursuant to the provisions set forth in the foregoing subsections of this Section 5.26.110
(Ord. 2010-0063 § 10, 2010; Ord. 2010-0014, § 11, 2010; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.120 - Payments to Trustee.
Matching Contributions shall be paid to the Trustee in cash at least monthly and shall be based upon the amount of Tax Deferred Contributions made during the month for which such Matching Contributions are made. Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if it appears to the Administrative Committee that the County will not be able to make Matching Contributions for a Plan Year or any part thereof because it appears there will not be sufficient Net Revenues, the County shall cease making Matching Contributions for such Plan Year on a monthly basis and shall make Matching Contributions, if any, within 30 days after the amount, if any, of Net Revenues for such Plan Year is determined.
If the amount of Matching Contributions for a Plan Year exceeds the amount which may be contributed to the Plan in accordance with Section 5.26.110 (except in the case of a mistake of fact covered by Section 5.26.150B), to the extent permitted by applicable law, such excess Matching Contributions shall be forfeited, placed in a suspense account and applied in accordance with Section 5.26.338.
Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, each reference to "month" in this Section 5.26.120 shall be deemed to be a reference to "payroll period" and each reference to "on a monthly basis" or "at least monthly" shall be deemed to be a reference to "each payroll period."
(Ord. 2010-0014, § 12, 2010: Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.130 - Allocation of Matching Contributions.
Matching Contributions shall be allocated and credited each month to the Matching Contributions Account of each Participant for whom Tax Deferred Contributions are made during such month, with each such Participant receiving a portion of the Matching Contributions equal to the amount calculated according to the provisions of Section 5.26.110. In the event that Matching Contributions are insufficient to provide each Participant with his fully allocated portion as provided in the preceding sentence, the Matching Contributions that are made shall be allocated proportionally to the Matching Contributions Account of each Participant in a manner consistent with such sentence. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, each reference to "month" in this Section 5.26.130 shall be deemed to be a reference to "payroll period."

The amount of Matching Contributions determined to be payable to the Matching Contributions Account pursuant to this Part 4 shall be reduced first in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.26.160C (with respect to amounts held in a suspense account) and then in accordance with Section 5.26.338

A.
Except as provided in subsection B of this Section 5.26.150 or in Section 5.26.120, 5.26.140 or 5.26.540, the Investment Funds shall never inure to the benefit of the County and shall be held for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to Participants and their Beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan.
B.
If any County Contribution is made by the County due to a mistake of fact, such contribution (but not the earnings thereon) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, be returned to the County within one year after it is made; if such contribution constituted a Tax Deferred Contribution, After-Tax Contribution, Termination Pay Contribution or Rollover Contribution, it shall thereafter be returned to the Participant to the extent permitted by applicable law. Additionally, if the Plan, or a portion thereof, is determined by the Internal Revenue Service not to satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a) and 401(k) for a qualified governmental plan containing a cash or deferred arrangement, any County Contributions attributable to that portion of the Plan that is determined to not be so qualified, and attributable to the period for which it is determined to not be so qualified, shall, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, be returned to the County. All amounts to be returned to the County must be returned from assets invested in Core Funds. If any Participant has insufficient assets invested in Core Funds, the Administrative Committee may transfer assets from Brokerage Investments to Core Funds as necessary.
(Ord. 2008-0071 § 3, 2008; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.160 - Provision Pursuant to Code Section 415(c).
A.
Definitions. For the purposes of this Section 5.26.160 and Section 5.26.170, the following definitions apply:
1.
"Annual Addition" means the sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant's account for any Limitation Year: (a) all contributions made by the County to any qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the County, (b) all contributions made by the Participant to any qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the County, (c) all forfeitures under any qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the County, and (d) contributions to an individual medical benefit account (as defined in Code Section 415(l)(2)) of a Participant that is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the County (except that the 25 percent of 415 Compensation limit, or, for Limitation Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the 100 percent of 415 Compensation limit, does not apply to such an individual medical benefit account).
2.
"County" means any entity the employees of which, together with employees of the County, are required to be treated as if they were employed by a single employer under Code Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) (taking into account any adjustment made pursuant to Code Section 415(h)), and any entity whose employees are treated as employees of the County under Code Section 414(n).
3.
"Limitation Year" means the twelve consecutive month period used by a Qualified Plan for the purposes of computing the limitations on benefits and annual additions under Code Section 415. The Limitation Year for this Plan is the Plan Year.
B.
Limit on Contributions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan for Limitation Years beginning before January 1, 2002, the Annual Addition for a Participant for any Limitation Year shall in no event exceed the lesser of (a) $30,000.00 or such higher adjusted amount as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Code Section 415(d) to reflect increases in the cost of living, or (b) 25 percent of the Participant's 415 Compensation during the Plan Year. For Limitation Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, except to the extent permitted under Section 5.26.060B regarding Catch-Up Contributions and Code Section 414(v), the Annual Addition for a Participant for any Limitation Year shall not exceed the lesser of (y) $40,000, as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living under Code Section 415(d), or (z) 100 percent of the Participant's 415 Compensation for the Plan Year.
C.
Excess Annual Additions.
1.
For Limitation Years beginning before July 1, 2007, if, as a result of the allocation of forfeitures, a reasonable error in estimating a Participant's Compensation, a reasonable error in determining the amount of elective deferrals under Code Section 402(g)(3), or under other limited facts and circumstances that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue finds justify the availability of the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-6(b)(6), a Participant's Annual Additions would exceed the limitations of subsection B for a Limitation Year, After-Tax Contributions (if any) made by the Participant for such Plan Year (together with any gains attributable thereto) shall be returned to him to the extent necessary to satisfy the limitations of subsection B. If return of such After-Tax Contributions is insufficient to cause the limitations of subsection B to be satisfied, as soon as practicable following the Limitation Year a portion of the Termination Pay Contribution (if any) made for such Participant for such Limitation Year (together with gains attributable thereto) shall be treated as an Employee contribution not eligible to be picked up under Part 5 and returned to him as a corrective disbursement to the extent necessary to satisfy the limitations of subsection B. If return of such Termination Pay Contribution is insufficient to cause the limitations of subsection B to be satisfied, Matching Contributions allocable to such Participant's Account for such Limitation Year shall, to the extent necessary to cause the limitation in subsection B to be satisfied, be held in a suspense account and used to reduce Matching Contributions for the next Limitation Year for that Participant if such Participant is covered by the Plan at the end of such Limitation Year; and if he is not covered by the Plan at the end of any such Limitation Year, the Matching Contributions held in the suspense account shall be allocated and reallocated pro rata (based on each Participant's Eligible Earnings) to the Accounts of other Participants, except that such allocation or reallocation shall not cause the limitations of subsection B to be exceeded for any other Participant for any other Limitation Year. Investment gains and losses shall not be allocated to the suspense account during the period such suspense account is required to be maintained. In the event of the termination of this Plan while there exists a balance in the suspense account, to the extent such balance cannot be allocated to Participant's Account without violating the limitations of this section, such balance shall revert to the County. If the allocation of Matching Contributions to the suspense account as described herein is not sufficient to cause the limitations of subsection B to be satisfied, Tax Deferred Contributions (other than Catch-Up Contributions) made for such Participant for such Limitation Year (together with gains attributable thereto) shall be returned to him to the extent necessary to satisfy the limitations under subsection B. In the event a reduction is necessary to satisfy subsection B, and the Participant participates in two or more defined contribution plans maintained by the County, the excess amount to be reduced will be deemed to consist of the Annual Addition last allocated. If an excess amount was allocated to a Participant on an allocation date of this Plan that coincides with an allocation date of another plan, the excess amount attributed to this Plan (to be reduced as provided above) will be the product of (1) the total excess amount allocated as of such date, and (2) the ratio of the Annual Addition allocated to the Participant for the Limitation Year under this Plan to the total Annual Additions allocated to the Participant for the Limitation Year for this and all other qualified defined contribution plans.
2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, if Annual Additions on behalf of any Participant in a Limitation Year to this Plan and all other defined contribution plans maintained by the County exceed the limitations of subsection B, such excess shall be corrected according to the Internal Revenue Service's Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System, or any successor correction program.
D.
Aggregation of Plans. For the purposes of applying the limitations set forth in this Section 5.26.160 and Section 5.26.170, all qualified defined benefit plans (whether or not terminated) ever maintained by the County shall be treated as one defined benefit plan, and all qualified defined contribution plans (whether or not terminated) ever maintained by the County shall be treated as one defined contribution plan.
(Ord. 2012-0056 § 3, 2012: Ord. 2008-0071 § 4, 2008; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.170 - Provision Pursuant to Code Section 415(e).
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the case of a Participant who is also a participant in any defined benefit plan qualified under Code Section 401(a), whether or not terminated, maintained by the County, the sum of the defined contribution plan fraction (as determined under Code Section 415(e)(3)) and the defined benefit plan fraction (as determined under Code Section 415(e)(2)) for any Limitation Year (as defined in Section 5.26.160A) shall in no event exceed 1.0. In the event a reduction is necessary to avoid exceeding the limitation set forth in this section, the affected Participant's Annual Additions (as defined in Section 5.26.160A) under this Plan shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding such limitation in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 5.26.160C. This Section 5.26.170 shall be inapplicable for Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2000.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)

4.
"Deemed Compensation" means the sum of a Participant's Prior-Year Award plus any Compensation that the Participant received (if any) during the Prior-Year Settlement Period.
5.
"Prior-Year Award" means the portion (if any) of the Settlement Award intended to make a Participant whole with respect to lost wages and benefits during the Prior-Year Settlement Period.

B.
Tax Deferred Contributions and After-Tax Contributions.
1.
For purposes of applying the provisions in Part 3 of Chapter 5.26 (including, without limitation, the limits set forth therein), the terms of this Section 5.26.171.B shall apply with respect to each Current-Year Award.
2.
Each Participant who receives a Current-Year Award shall be deemed to be eligible for a contribution of a fraction of the award on each Contribution Date that falls within the Current-Year Settlement Period, with the denominator of such fraction equal to the number of Contribution Dates in the Current-Year Settlement Period and the numerator of such fraction equal to the total amount of the Current-Year Award. The terms of a Participant's Compensation Deferral Agreement and/or Salary Deduction Agreement in effect as of each Contribution Date within the Current-Year Settlement Period shall apply to determine the portion of the Current-Year Award to be deferred and/or deducted and contributed to the Plan with respect to such Contribution Date.
3.
For purposes of this Section 5.26.171.B, the terms of a Participant's Compensation Deferral Agreement and/or Salary Deduction Agreement in effect as of each Contribution Date within the Current-Year Settlement Period shall be determined as follows:
a.
For a Participant who continued to be an Eligible Employee during the Current-Year Settlement Period, the Participant's actual deferral and/or deduction elections in effect as of each Contribution Date shall apply to determine the portion of the Current-Year Award to be deferred and/or deducted and contributed to the Plan with respect to each such Contribution Date.

2.
With respect to each month in the Current-Year Settlement Period, the department to which a Participant has been reinstated shall make a Matching Contribution to the Matching Contributions Account of such Participant in an amount equal to the difference between the Matching Contribution the Participant actually received in such month (if any) and the Matching Contribution the Participant would have received in such month if the Tax Deferred Contributions described in Section 5.26.171.B that are made with respect to such month had been made on the Contribution Dates in such month.
3.
Each Matching Contribution that is made to a Participant's Matching Contributions Account pursuant to this Section 5.26.171.C shall be deemed to have been made in the month with respect to which such Matching Contribution was made.

b.
The department to which a Participant is reinstated shall make a corrective contribution to the Participant's Matching Contributions Account with respect to each month in the Prior-Year Settlement Period in an amount equal to the positive difference (if any) between (a) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to 4% of such Participant's Deemed Compensation and the denominator of which is equal to the number of months in the Prior-Year Settlement Period, less (b) the Matching Contribution the Participant actually received in such month (if any).
4.
Each corrective contribution that is made with respect to a month within the Prior-Year Settlement Period as provided in this Section 5.26.171.D shall be deemed to have been made in such month. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.26.171.D, the corrective contributions that a Participant is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be reduced to the extent such contributions exceed the limits referenced in Section 5.26.160
5.
Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, each reference to "month" in this Section 5.26.171.D shall be deemed to be a reference to "payroll period."

2.
The County shall require each department that fails to provide advance notice of a Settlement Award as described in this Section 5.26.171.F to make all applicable Plan contributions to which a Participant is entitled pursuant to this Part 4.5 with respect to such award.
(Ord. 2010-0014, § 14, 2010; Ord. 2008-0004 § 13, 2008.)
Part 5 - TERMINATION PAY CONTRIBUTION
Sections:

5.26.173 - Amount of Contribution.
Subject to the limitations contained in Section 5.26.160, effective December 3, 2004, an Eligible Employee (including an Eligible Employee who has already become a Participant pursuant to Section 5.26.040A) may, pursuant to a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement, elect to have the County deduct a fixed percentage or dollar amount from his Termination Pay and contribute such fixed percentage or dollar amount to the Plan pursuant to a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement. The County shall pick up such contribution under Code Section 414(h)(2). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, on and after January 1, 2008, no Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreements may be entered, and no Termination Pay Contributions shall be made to or received by the Plan on behalf of any Participant pursuant to this Part 5 of the Plan, irrespective of whether such Participant has entered a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement before that date.
(Ord. 2008-0004 § 14, 2008: Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.175 - Pick Up Requirements.
A.
An Eligible Employee shall enter into a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee.
B.
The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is binding and irrevocable upon execution. A Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is deemed executed on the date the completed, signed Agreement is filed with the County or its agent. Once executed, the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement may not be amended or revoked. An Eligible Employee who executes a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement shall thereafter have no option to receive in cash, or to otherwise direct the disposition of, the fixed percentage or dollar amount of his Termination Pay that he has elected to contribute to the Plan as a Termination Pay Contribution. However, executing a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement shall have no affect on an Eligible Employee's ability to utilize any accrued benefits by taking vacation, sick or other leave while employed with the County.
C.
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.26.175, a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement must be executed at least 90 days prior to the Eligible Employee's Severance Date. The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is effective upon execution. The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement, however, shall not apply to any Termination Pay that becomes payable in the event the Eligible Employee's Severance Date is less than 90 days after the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is executed, unless the Eligible Employee experiences an Involuntary Early Severance. If the Eligible Employee's Severance Date occurs later than originally designated, the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement will remain effective until his actual Severance Date.
D.
If a Participant is rehired by the County after his Severance Date, any Termination Pay Contribution made on his behalf to the Plan shall remain in the Plan unless and until distributed in accordance with Part 7, and the cashed out accrued benefits attributable thereto shall not be restored for any reason.
E.
Each Eligible Employee shall be eligible to make only one election to have Termination Pay picked up within the meaning of Code Section 414(h)(2). Accordingly, an Eligible Employee may not execute more than one Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement. If the Eligible Employee intends to have a portion of his Termination Pay picked up and contributed to purchase service with LACERA and a portion of his Termination Pay picked up and contributed to the Plan, he must execute a single Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement covering both elections. If the Eligible Employee elects to contribute Termination Pay both to LACERA and to the Plan, his Termination Pay will be picked up and contributed first to LACERA, in satisfaction of the election to purchase additional retirement credit under the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement, and second to the Plan, in satisfaction of the election to contribute to the Plan under the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement. In no event, will the Termination Pay Contribution under the Plan exceed the amount of Termination Pay available after deduction therefrom to make contributions to LACERA in accordance with the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement.
F.
Termination Pay Contributions made pursuant to this Part 5, although designated under the Plan as employee contributions, shall be paid by the County in lieu of employee contributions.
G.
The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement shall be executed by the Eligible Employee and shall provide that such Eligible Employee authorizes the appropriate deduction from his Termination Pay for the purposes of having it picked up and contributed to the Plan by the County, and that the Eligible Employee understands and acknowledges the requirements and limitations of this Section 5.26.175
H.
As a condition to entering the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement, the County may require an employee to execute a release from liability for any adverse consequences that may result if the Internal Revenue Service or a court determines that a contribution to the Plan pursuant to a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is not a picked up contribution within the meaning of Code Section 414(h)(2), or that the Plan is not a Qualified Plan.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.178 - Payment to Trustee.
Each Termination Pay Contribution shall be paid by the County to the Trustee within a reasonable period after a Participant's Severance Date, but in no event later than the last day of the month following the month containing the Participant's Severance Date or the final calculation of the amount of the Termination Pay by the County, whichever is later.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
Part 6 - INVESTMENTS
Sections:

5.26.180 - Investment of Funds.
A.
County Contributions shall be allocated to the Investment Funds as specified under Sections 5.26.200 and 5.26.210. Subject to the other applicable provisions of the Plan and the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall hold, manage, administer, value, invest, reinvest, account for and otherwise deal with each Investment Fund separately. The Trustee or Investment Manager shall invest and reinvest the principal and income of each Fund and shall keep each such Fund invested, without distinction between principal and income, in such property, investments and securities as the Investment Manager for such Fund may deem to be suitable and in accordance with the requirements for such fund specified by the Administrative Committee upon its creation.
B.
Dividends, interest and other distributions received in respect of each Investment Fund shall be reinvested in the same fund in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement.
C.
The Trustee, in its sole discretion, may keep such portion of each Investment Fund in cash or cash equivalents either pending the selection and purchase of suitable investments under such Fund or as the Trustee may from time to time deem to be necessary or advisable to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet the obligations of the Plan or for other reasons.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.190 - Account.
Each Participant shall have established for him a Tax Deferred Contributions Account, an After-Tax Contributions Account, a Termination Pay Contribution Account, a Rollover Contributions Account and a Matching Contributions Account to reflect the Tax Deferred Contributions, After-Tax Contributions, Termination Pay Contribution, Rollover Contributions and Matching Contributions, respectively, that are made for him. On or after January 1, 2002, the Administrative Committee in its discretion may establish a separate account or subaccount (a "Catch-Up Contributions Account") under the Plan for any Catch-Up Contributions for each Participant eligible to make such contributions. Separate records shall be maintained for each Account showing the portion of such Account invested in each Investment Fund and showing the amount of contributions to each such Account, payments and withdrawals therefrom and the amount of income, expenses, gains and losses attributable thereto. Collectively, such Accounts are referred to herein as a Participant's Account and the interest of each Participant hereunder at any time shall consist of his Account balance (as determined in Section 5.26.210) as of the last preceding Valuation Date plus credits and minus debits to such Account since that Valuation Date.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.200 - Investment of Contributions.
A.
Investment by Participants.
1.
Each Participant may instruct the Trustee or TPA, as applicable, to allocate his Tax Deferred Contributions, After-Tax Contributions, Termination Pay Contribution, Rollover Contributions and, if his Matching Contributions Account is 100 percent vested and nonforfeitable under Section 5.26.250, Matching Contributions (collectively, "Contributions") among the Investment Funds. A Participant may only instruct the Trustee or TPA to allocate amounts to the Personal Brokerage Account Window if the Participant's Account balance invested in the Core Funds satisfies the threshold level determined by the Administrative Committee. A Participant may change the allocation of future Contributions among Core Funds and may transfer past Contributions, adjusted for earnings, gains and losses, and applicable Plan charges, if any, from one Core Fund to another, or between a Core Fund and the Personal Brokerage Account Window. Amounts allocated to and from the Personal Brokerage Account Window are allocated pursuant to Section 5.26.200.C. A Participant may make investment elections and changes at the time and manner prescribed by procedures established from time to time by the Administrative Committee.
2.
In addition, effective October 1, 1999, each Participant likewise may instruct the Trustee or TPA, as applicable, to allocate among the Investment Funds the portion of his or her Matching Contributions Account that is vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with Section 5.26.200A.l.
3.
Upon the merger of the Deferred Earnings Plan into this Plan, effective May 30, 2008:
a.
Investments in a participant's account under the County Deferred Earnings Plan — other than any investment in the participant loan fund under the County Deferred Earnings Plan — shall be liquidated and then the cash shall be transferred as soon as practicable to this Plan, unless the Administrative Committee otherwise makes arrangements for an in-kind transfer of assets. As soon as practicable following the transfer, the transferred cash shall be invested in accordance with the Participant's investment instructions or, if the Participant does not timely provide investment instructions, in the same Investment Funds (or a similar Investment Fund if the identical fund is not an available investment alternative) from which those amounts were liquidated and in the same proportions as they were invested under the County Deferred Earnings Plan.
b.
The promissory note for any outstanding loan from a Participant's account in the Deferred Earnings Plan shall be transferred to the Participant Loan Fund under the Plan, and the balance owing and obligations under such loan shall become the balance owing and obligations due under the Plan. The Participant's transferred loan shall be treated as an investment in the Participant Loan Fund and shall be administered in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the applicable promissory note. Any outstanding loan that is transferred under this section, however, shall not be taken into account when determining whether a Participant has exceeded any limit on the number of loans permitted under this Plan by the rules set forth by the Administrative Committee.
4.
Investment through Personal Brokerage Account Window. Any amount of a Participant's Account allocated by a Participant to the Personal Brokerage Account Window pursuant to Section 5.26.200.A.1 shall be transferred first into the Brokerage Money Market Fund. Thereafter, the Participant may direct the Broker to invest those amounts in any available Brokerage Investments. The Administrative Committee, in its discretion, may restrict the types of Brokerage Investments that may be held by the Plan. Transfers from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to Core Funds shall be made only from the Brokerage Money Market Fund.
B.
Investment by Administrative Committee. Plan assets that are not invested pursuant to Participant instructions under Section 5.26.200A, including but not limited to Plan assets for which no Participant investment instructions are received, nonvested Matching Contributions that are not subject to Participant instructions under Section 5.26.200A, forfeiture accounts, accumulated fees and unallocated Plan earnings, shall be invested by the Trustee as instructed by the Administrative Committee in one or more Investment Funds as the Administrative Committee in its discretion may determine.
(Ord. 2008-0071 § 5, 2008; Ord. 2008-0022 § 7, 2008: Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.210 - Trust Fund Allocation and Valuation.
A.
Allocation.
1.
Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrative Committee, the assets credited to each Participant's Account shall be allocated among the Core Funds in accordance with the investment option or options chosen by such Participant or the Administrative Committee, as the case may be, effective no later than the first business day following the business day on which the Trustee or its agent has received appropriate instructions, or such later date as is commercially reasonable under the circumstances. Transfers from the Core Funds to the Personal Brokerage Account Window, from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to Core Funds, from the Brokerage Money Market Fund to Brokerage Investments, between Brokerage Investments, and from such Brokerage Investments back to the Brokerage Money Market Fund shall be completed within a commercially reasonable time and in accordance with the terms of any applicable TPA and Broker contracts.
2.
As of each Valuation Date, the net gain or loss of each Investment Fund, determined in accordance with Section 5.26.210B below, shall be allocated by the Trustee or its agent in accordance with the instructions received by the Trustee from the TPA to the Accounts of Participants in such Investment Funds in proportion to the amounts of such Accounts invested in such Investment Fund on such Valuation Date, exclusive of amounts to be credited but including amounts (other than the net loss, if any, determined pursuant to Section 5.26.210B) to be debited to such Accounts as of such Valuation Date.
B.
Valuation.
1.
As of the close of business of each Valuation Date, the TPA or the custodian, as delegated by the Administrative Committee, shall determine or cause to be determined the value of each Core Fund. Valuation of the Participant holdings in the Brokerage Investments shall be communicated to the TPA by the Broker pursuant to the agreement between the Administrative Committee and the Broker. The TPA or custodian may rely on net asset value calculations, book values and other data with respect to the value of Plan assets held in the Investment Funds furnished to it by the Administrative Committee, Investment Managers, the County Treasurer, custodians or other entities authorized to provide valuation data. The TPA or custodian shall communicate such valuation to the Trustee. The TPA or custodian shall be responsible for monthly reconciliation of its records with the records of the third-parties from which it receives valuation data.
2.
Each such valuation shall be made on the basis of the net gain or loss to each such Core Fund between the current Valuation Date and the last preceding Valuation Date. The net gain or loss of a Core Fund shall include realized and unrealized earnings, interest income, dividends actually paid and other income of such Fund during such period, and shall be reduced by expenses paid, if any, that are to be charged to such Core Fund in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement. The transfer of funds to or from a Core Fund, the allocation of Tax Deferred Contributions, After-Tax Contributions, Termination Pay Contributions, Rollover Contributions and Matching Contributions, and payments, distributions and withdrawals from a Core Fund to provide benefits under the Plan for Participants or Beneficiaries shall not be deemed to be income, expenses or losses of the Core Fund. A similar valuation shall be made at any other time the TPA or custodian, Administrative Committee or its agent deems it appropriate to make such a valuation.
3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Committee or its agent may, in accordance with applicable requirements of applicable law, instruct the TPA or custodian to (a) adopt such accounting procedures as the Administrative Committee or its agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to establish a proportionate crediting of net gain or loss of an Investment Fund and of Contributions made to an Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date, and (b) adopt such other valuation procedures as the Administrative Committee or its agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to determine the value of the Investment Funds. Subject to the TPA's or custodian's rights and duties under the contract between it and the County, the reasonable and equitable decision of the TPA or custodian as to the value of each Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and Beneficiaries having any interest, direct or indirect, in such Investment Fund."
C.
No Guarantee Against Loss. The County, the Board of Supervisors, the Administrative Committee, the TPA and the Trustee do not guarantee in any manner the Investment Funds or any part thereof against loss or depreciation. All persons having an interest in the Investment Funds shall look solely to such Funds for payment with respect to such interest. The County, the Board of Supervisors, the Administrative Committee, the TPA and the Trustee are not authorized to advise a Participant as to that Participant's selection of Investment Funds, and the fact that designated Investment Funds are available to Participants for investment shall not be construed as a recommendation for the investment of contributions hereunder in all or any of such Funds. The selection of an Investment Fund by a Participant is his or her sole responsibility and shall constitute an exercise of control over the assets of his or her Account. In accordance with California Government Code Section 53213.5, each Participant who so exercises control shall, by such exercise, release and agree, on his or her behalf and on behalf of his or her heirs and beneficiaries, to indemnify and hold harmless the County, the Board of Supervisors, the Administrative Committee, the TPA, the Trustee and any agent, officer or employee of any of them, from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, costs or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by or arising out of such exercise, including without limitation any diminution in value or losses incurred from such exercise.
(Ord. 2009-0040 § 10, 2009; Ord. 2008-0071 § 6, 2008; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
Part 7 - DISTRIBUTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS
Sections:

5.26.240 - Distributions Only As Provided.
A.
A Participant or Beneficiary shall only be paid vested benefits under the Plan as provided in this and the following sections of this part. A Participant or Beneficiary who is eligible to receive a distribution under the Plan shall submit an application for benefits to the Administrative Committee, furnishing such information as the Administrative Committee or its duly authorized agent may require. Except to the extent an in-service withdrawal is permitted under Section 5.26.300, a Participant or Beneficiary may receive a distribution only upon a bona fide termination from employment. For the purposes of this Part 7, a bona fide termination from employment means any bona fide termination of a Participant's relationship with the County as an Employee, including termination due to death, disability, or retirement. A Participant has not had a bona fide termination from employment if, at the time the Participant leaves County employment, there is a prearrangement or understanding that the Participant will be rehired or otherwise returned to service by the County.
(Ord. 2014-0017 § 17, 2014: Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.245 - Distribution, Withdrawals or Loans from Core Funds.
A.
Distributions, Withdrawals or Loans from Core Funds Generally. Except as provided in subsection B. of this section, all Distributions, Withdrawals or Loans must be made from amounts allocated to Core Funds. If the Participant has allocated an insufficient amount to Core Funds for a requested Distribution, Withdrawal, or Loan, the Participant must transfer sufficient amounts from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to Core Funds to enable the requested Distribution, Withdrawal or Loan. The Administrative Committee may reallocate the funds in a Participant's Account from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to Core Funds if such action is necessary for the administration of the plan.
B.
Notwithstanding subsection A. of this section, a Participant or Beneficiary may request an in-kind distribution of securities held through the Personal Brokerage Account Window subject to the following requirements: (1) the Participant's Account must be 100% vested, (2) the Participant or Beneficiary must be entitled to receive and must request a full distribution of the Account from both the Core Funds and the Personal Brokerage Account Window, and (3) the in-kind distribution must be made in the form of a direct rollover to an "eligible retirement plan" as authorized in section 5.26.610 and the "eligible retirement plan" must accept the in-kind rollover.
(Ord. 2009-0040 § 11, 2009: Ord. 2008-0071 § 7, 2008.)
5.26.250 - Nonforfeitability.
Any amount credited to a Participant's Tax Deferred Contributions Account, Catch-Up Contributions Account (if any), After-Tax Contributions Account, Termination Pay Contribution Account and Rollover Contributions Account shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested. Any amount credited to a Participant's Matching Contributions Account shall vest and become nonforfeitable at the rate of 20 percent for each Year of Service completed by such Participant.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.260 - Distributions on Retirement or Disability.
A.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.26.250, the entire Account of a Participant whose employment with the County terminates after he is age 70 or qualified for a service retirement benefit under the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937, as amended, if earlier, or whose employment with the county terminates because of Disability, shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested. Such Account shall be paid to the Participant or his Beneficiary, in cash or in kind to the extent permitted under section 5.26.245B., in accordance with one of the following methods as the Participant determines:
1.
A lump-sum payment; or
2.
Substantially equal monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annual installments not extending for a period that is longer than the life of the Participant or the lives of the Participant and his or her designated Beneficiary and the last survivor of them; or
3.

4.
A combination of the methods of payment described in subsections A1, 2 and 3 of this section.
B.
All distributions hereunder shall be made on or begun as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant's application is filed pursuant to Section 5.26.240 and approved by the Administrative Committee. A Participant's election to begin distribution and selection of a payment method shall be irrevocable except as provided in subsection C. For purposes of a distribution, the date that such Participant's interest in an Investment Fund is liquidated or redeemed, partially or in full, to satisfy the distribution application shall be the applicable Valuation Date.
C.
Participants whose distributions under this Plan have already begun or who submitted an application to begin distributions may elect to change their previously irrevocable payment elections no more frequently than once in any Plan Year, which election shall be deemed to be made at the time that the benefit election becomes effective. The election shall be made on a form approved by the Administrative Committee and shall be subject to minimum distribution requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. This subsection C shall apply to Beneficiaries who are receiving distributions under the Plan pursuant to Section 5.26.270.

5.26.270 - Distributions on Death.
A.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.26.250, if a Participant dies prior to terminating his employment with the County, his entire Account shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested. In addition, effective January 1, 2007, a Participant's entire Account shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested if the Participant dies while performing "qualified military service," as defined in Code section 414(u)(5). Such Account shall be paid by the Trustee to the Participant's Beneficiary after the Trustee is notified by the Administrative Committee of the Participant's death.
B.
A Participant shall have the right to designate that after his death his Account shall be paid to or for his Beneficiary in accordance with one of the methods set forth in subsection A of Section 5.26.260. Any designation by a Participant of the method of payment of death benefits hereunder may be made, changed or revoked by the Participant in writing in a form prescribed by the Administrative Committee and filed with the Administrative Committee prior to the Participant's death.
C.
If a Participant does not expressly designate the method of distribution of his Account, or if such designation is for any reason not effective, such Account shall be paid to or for the Beneficiary in accordance with one of the methods set forth in subsection A of Section 5.26.260 as such Beneficiary, in his or her discretion, shall determine and designate to the Administrative Committee.
D.
If distributions have not already begun at the time of the Participant's death, and to the extent permitted under section 5.26.290, a Beneficiary may elect to defer distribution of the Participant's Account and direct the investment of such Account as though he was the Participant in accordance with section 5.26.200; provided, however, that if a portion of the Participant's Account is invested through the Personal Brokerage Account Window, the Beneficiary will be required to enter his own contract with the Broker to open a brokerage account and retain any investments held in the Account through the Personal Brokerage Account Window.
(Ord. 2014-0017 § 18, 2014; Ord. 2009-0040 § 13, 2009; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.280 - Distributions of Vested Interest.
A.
A Participant whose employment with the County terminates for any reason other than the reasons specified in Section 5.26.260 or 5.26.270 shall receive his entire Tax Deferred Contributions Account, Catch-Up Contributions Account (if any), After-Tax Contributions Account (if any), Termination Pay Contribution Account (if any), Rollover Contributions Account (if any) and the portion of his Matching Contributions Account in which he is vested in accordance with Section 5.26.250. The portion of his Matching Contributions Account which is not so vested shall be immediately forfeited. If a Participant forfeits a portion of his Account and he is later rehired by the County, his employment with the County or participation in the Plan after such rehire shall have no effect on the amount of the forfeiture. If such a rehired Participant subsequently becomes party to another Compensation Deferral Agreement, any Matching Contributions thereafter made by the County and any earnings and investment gains or losses allocable thereto shall be credited to a separate Matching Contributions Account maintained for such Participant and shall vest as provided herein without regard to any Year of Service prior to his rehire.
B.
Amounts distributed pursuant to subsection A of this Section 5.26.280 shall be paid in accordance with one of the methods set forth in subsection A of Section 5.26.260 as selected by the Participant.
C.
A Participant has not terminated employment with the "County" for the purposes of this Section 5.26.280 when he or she moves to another employer whose Eligible Employees also participate in the Plan.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.290 - Code Section 401(a)(9) Minimum Distribution Requirements.
A.
Prior Plan Provision. With respect to distributions under the Plan made for calendar years beginning prior to January 1, 2003, the following provisions will apply. These prior Plan provisions are preserved in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2002-29.
1.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, distributions under the Plan shall be made in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) (including Section 401(a)(9)(G)) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (including Section 1.401(a)(9)-2); provided, however, that such provisions shall override the other distribution provisions of the Plan only to the extent that such other Plan provisions provide for a distribution that is less rapid or of a lesser amount than required under such provisions of the Code and Regulations. Nothing contained in this Section 2.26.290 shall be construed as providing an optional form of payment that is not available under the other distribution provisions of Sections 5.26.260—280.
2.
The entire interest of each Participant under the Plan:
a.
Either will be distributed to him not later than his taxable year in which he attains age 70 1/2 or in his taxable year in which he retires from County service, whichever is the later (his "Required Beginning Date"); or
b.
Will be distributed, commencing not later than his Required Beginning Date, (i) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, over the life of such Participant or over the lives of such Participant and his designated Beneficiary, or (ii) in accordance with such regulations, over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such Participant or the life expectancy of such Participant and his designated Beneficiary.
3.
Upon the death of a Participant, the following distribution provisions will apply to limit the Beneficiary's ability to delay distributions.
a.
If the Participant dies after distribution of his benefit has begun, the remaining portion of his benefit will continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used prior to the Participant's death.
b.
If the Participant dies before distribution of his benefit has begun, his entire benefit will be distributed no later than five years after his death, unless an individual who is a designated Beneficiary elects to receive distributions in substantially equal installments over the Beneficiary's life or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Beneficiary (and, if the Beneficiary is not the Participant's spouse, not extending beyond 15 years in accordance with the distribution options available under Sections 5.26.260 and 5.26.270) beginning no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died. If the designated Beneficiary is the Participant's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin is the later of December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died or December 31 of the calendar year in which such Participant would have attained age 70-1/2. If the spouse dies before such payments begin, subsequent distributions will be made as if the spouse had been the Participant.
c.
Generally, distributions will be treated as having begun to the Participant for the purposes of this Section 5.26.290 on the employee's Required Beginning Date, even though payments may actually have been made before that date; provided, however, that if distributions irrevocably (except for acceleration) commence to an employee under an annuity contract, distributions will be considered to have begun on the actual commencement date.
4.
The Participant (or the Participant's spouse if the Participant dies before distributions have begun) may elect not to recalculate annually the life expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's spouse (other than in the case of a life annuity) in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9)(D) and the Regulations thereunder. Such election must be made prior to the time of the first required distribution under Code Section 401(a)(9). If the Participant (or spouse if applicable) fails to make such election, life expectancies will be recalculated annually in accordance with the Regulations.
5.
2001 Proposed Regulations. With respect to distributions under the Plan made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the Plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code in accordance with the regulations under Section 401(a)(9) that were proposed on January 17, 2001, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary. This amendment shall continue in effect until the end of the last calendar year beginning before the effective date of final regulations under Section 401(a)(9) or such other date as may be specified in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service.
B.
Generally. The provisions of Section 5.26.290B-G will apply for the purposes of determining required minimum distributions for Distribution Calendar Years beginning January 1, 2003. The requirements of Section 5.26.290B-G will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, all distributions required under Sections 5.26.260 and 5.26.270 of this Plan will be determined and made in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code. The only permissible distribution options under this Plan are a lump sum distribution, equal monthly, quarterly or annual installments not extending over more than 15 years, consecutive periodic payments for the life of the Participant or for the lives of the Participant and his or her spouse to the extent permitted in Section 5.26.260, or minimum monthly distributions calculated in accordance with the rules provided in Section 5.26.290B-G.
C.

1.
"Designated Beneficiary": The person who is designated as the Beneficiary as defined in Section 5.26.020.7 of the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-4 of the Treasury Regulations.
2.
"Distribution Calendar Year": A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Participant's Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under Section 5.26.290D.2 of the Plan. The required minimum distribution for the Participant's first Distribution Calendar Year will be made on or before the Participant's Required Beginning Date. The required minimum distribution for other Distribution Calendar Years, including the required minimum distribution for the Distribution Calendar Year in which the Member's Required Beginning Date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that Distribution Calendar Year.
3.
"Life Expectancy": Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations.
4.
"Participant's Account Balance": The Account balance as of the last Valuation Date in the calendar year immediately preceding the Distribution Calendar Year (the "Valuation Calendar Year") increased by the amount of any contributions made and allocated or forfeitures allocated to the Account balance as of dates in the Valuation Calendar Year after the Valuation Date and decreased by distributions made in the Valuation Calendar Year after the Valuation Date. The Account balance for the Valuation Calendar Year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the Plan either in the Valuation Calendar Year or in the Distribution Calendar Year if distributed or transferred in the Valuation Calendar Year.
5.
"Required Beginning Date": The applicable date specified in subsection D below.
D.
Time of Distribution.
1.
The Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date. Except as described in subsection D.2 below, the Required Beginning Date of any Participant shall be the April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (a) the calendar year he terminates employment or (b) the calendar year he attains age 70 1/2.
2.
If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
(a)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection D.4 below is made, distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2, if later.
(b)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection D.4 below is made, distributions to the Designated Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died.
(c)
If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
(d)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection D.2, other than subsection D.2(a), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
3.
For purposes of Section 5.26.290B-G, unless subsection D.2(d) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Beginning Date. If subsection D.2(d) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection D.2(a). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant's Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection D.2(d), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant dies before distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, distribution to the Designated Beneficiary is not required to begin by the Required Beginning Date specified above if the Participant or the Beneficiary elects, on an individual basis, that the Participant's entire interest will be distributed to the Designated Beneficiary by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; provided, however, that if the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to either the Participant or the surviving spouse begin, this election will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. The election provided in this subsection D.4 must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distribution would be required to begin, or by September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the Participant's (or, if applicable, surviving spouse's) death.
E.
Required Minimum Distributions During Participant's Lifetime.
1.
During the Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of:
(a)
The quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year; or
(b)
If the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year.
2.
Required minimum distributions will be determined under this subsection E beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant's date of death.
3.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations.
F.
Required Minimum Distributions if Participant Dies After Distributions Begin.
1.
Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as follows:
(a)
The Participant's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
(b)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as of the spouse's birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving spouse's death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.
(c)
If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated Beneficiary's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
2.
No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary (for example, if pursuant to the Plan, the Beneficiary is the Participant's estate) as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the Participant's remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.
3.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations.
G.
Death Before Date Distributions Begin:
1.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, then, unless the election described in subsection D.4 above is made, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account Balance by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in subsection F.1, above.
2.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.
3.
If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection D.2(a), Section 5.26.290B-G will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
4.
If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations.
H.
Notwithstanding the other subsections of this Section 5.26.290, a Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive a required minimum distribution (RMD) for 2009 but for the enactment of Code section 401(a)(9)(H) of the Code (2009 RMD), and who would have satisfied that requirement by receiving distributions that are (1) equal to the 2009 RMD or (2) one or more payments in a series of substantially equal distributions (that include the 2009 RMD) made at least annually and expected to last for the life (or life expectancy) of the Participant, the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary, or for a period of at least 10 years, will not receive those distributions for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses to receive such distributions. Participants and beneficiaries described in the preceding sentence will be given the opportunity to elect to receive the distributions described in the preceding sentence. For the purposes of this subsection H, any election on file to receive automated RMDs, even if received before 2009, is treated as an election to receive those distributions in 2009 except to the extent such election is revoked in accordance with a procedure established by the TPA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a direct rollover will be offered only for distributions that would be Eligible Rollover Distributions without regard to Code section 401(a)(9)(H).
(Ord. 2014-0017 § 19, 2014; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.300 - Withdrawal of Contributions.
Upon not less than 30 days prior written notice filed with the Administrative Committee, effective as of the Entry Date following notification of the Trustee and Investment Manager by the Administrative Committee, a Participant who is an Employee may withdraw in cash all or a part of his Account balance as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date as provided and in the order set forth below. Except in cases of Hardship, a Participant may make only two withdrawals pursuant to this Section 5.26.300 per Plan Year.
A.
A Participant may withdraw all or a part of his After-Tax Contributions Account (if any).
B.
A Participant may withdraw all or a part of his Rollover Contributions Account (if any).
C.
A Participant may withdraw all or a part of his Matching Contributions Account in which he has a vested interest but a Participant may not make a withdrawal pursuant to this subsection unless he is either credited with at least 10 Years of Service or such withdrawal is made due to Hardship.
D.
A Participant who has withdrawn his entire After-Tax Contributions Account (if any), his entire Rollover Contributions Account (if any), and his entire Matching Contributions Account (to the extent vested) may in addition withdraw all or a part of his Tax Deferred Contributions Account (excluding any earnings credited to such Account on or after January 1, 1989), provided that the Participant has attained 59 1/2 or demonstrated to the Administrative Committee that he is suffering from Hardship. A withdrawal shall not be permitted for Hardship unless such withdrawal is on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant and is necessary to satisfy such financial need.
1.
Effective as of January 1, 2006, the determination of whether a Participant has an immediate and heavy financial need shall be made by the Administrative Committee on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. Nevertheless, a withdrawal shall be deemed to be made on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant if the withdrawal is on account of:
a.
Expenses for (or necessary to obtain) medical care that would be deductible under Section 213(d) of the Code (determined without regard to whether the expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income);
b.
The purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence of the Participant;
c.
The payment of tuition for the next semester or quarter of post-secondary education for the Participant, the Participant's spouse, the Participant's children, or the Participant's dependents (as defined in section 152 of the Code, and for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, without regard to section 152(b)(1), (b)(2) or (d)(1)(B) of the Code);
d.
The need to prevent the eviction of the Participant from his principal residence or the foreclosure on the mortgage of the Participant's principal residence;
e.
On and after January 1, 2007, payment for burial or funeral expenses for the Participant's deceased parent, spouse, children or dependents (as defined in section 152 of the Code but without regard to subsection 152(d)(1)(B));
f.
On and after January 1, 2007, expenses for the repair of damage to the Participant's principal residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under section 165 of the Code (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income); or
g.
Any other financial need which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, through the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of general applicability, may from time to time designate as a deemed immediate and heavy financial need as provided in Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(2)(iii)(C) of the Treasury Regulations.
2.
Effective as of January 1, 2006, a withdrawal shall not be treated as necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant to the extent the amount of the withdrawal exceeds the amount required to relieve the financial need or to the extent such need may be satisfied from other resources that are reasonably available to the Participant. The determination of whether the amount of a withdrawal is necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need shall be made by the Administrative Committee on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. Nevertheless, the amount of a withdrawal shall be deemed to be necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant if: (a) the amount of the distribution is not in excess of the amount of the immediate and heavy financial need; (b) the Participant has obtained all distributions (other than Hardship distributions) and nontaxable (at the time of the loan) loans available under the terms of this Plan or any other plans of deferred compensation maintained by the County; and (c) the Participant irrevocably elects to suspend all elective contributions and employee contributions under this Plan (e.g., After-Tax Contributions and Tax Deferred Contributions) and all other plans of deferred compensation maintained by the County from the date on which the withdrawal is made until the close of the six-calendar-month period that began on the first day of the month following the date on which the withdrawal is made. For the purposes of this subsection D2, the term "other plans of deferred compensation" include, without limitation, all qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans and any cash or deferred arrangements that are part of a cafeteria plan, except that it does not include the mandatory employee contribution component of a defined benefit plan or welfare plan. For the purposes of this subsection D2 the County includes the County and all other employers which are required to be treated as a single "employer" under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-6. If a Participant who also participates in the Horizons Plan takes an unforeseeable emergency distribution under the Horizons Plan, then, in accordance with the terms of the Horizons Plan, that Participant likewise irrevocably elects to suspend all elective contributions and employee contributions under all plans of deferred compensation maintained by the County, including this Plan, from the date on which the withdrawal is made until the close of the six-calendar-month period that began on the first day of the month following the date on which the withdrawal is made.
3.
Distributions may be made for expenses described in subsections 1.a., c. or e. (relating to medical, tuition, and funeral expenses, respectively) for a primary Beneficiary under the Plan as if that Beneficiary were the Participant's spouse or dependent.
(Ord. 2014-0017 § 20, 2014; Ord. 2008-0004 § 15, 2008; Ord. 2007-0001 § 5, 2007; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)

Within a specified period of time, which shall not extend beyond five years from the time the loan is made unless the loan proceeds are used to acquire a dwelling, which within a reasonable time is to be used as a principal residence (as determined at the time the loan is made) of the Participant, in which case the promissory note shall provide for repayment within 15 years of the time the loan is made, unless otherwise provided by the Administrative Committee at the time the loan is made, and

5.26.420 - Expense Charges to Plan.
A.
Prior to the beginning of each County fiscal year, the Administrative Committee shall determine the amount of annual fees that it reasonably estimates will be necessary to properly administer the Plan during such fiscal year. For purposes of its determination, the Administrative Committee shall take into account (i) direct, additional County costs expected to be incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions defined in Part 8 and (ii) the cost of contractors that provide services to the Plan, including, without limitation, fiduciary and liability insurance coverage, communication consultants, investment advisors, auditors and legal services, pursuant to contracts that are approved by the Board or the Administrative Committee. The expenses subject to this subsection shall not include the cost of TPA fees, Trustee fees and investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds. The expenses incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions described in Part 8 shall not exceed the amount approved by the Board of Supervisors in the County budget. Expenses incurred as a result of contractors performing the Plan functions, and the cost of fiduciary and liability insurance, are limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board. The annual fees approved by the Administrative Committee may be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the County. The estimated annual fees for the Plan approved by the Administrative Committee pursuant to this subsection will be charged to each Participant's account on a per-capita basis. The per-Participant, annual charge will be determined by dividing the estimated annual fees for the Plan by the number of Participants on the last day of the calendar year prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the fees are being determined. The per-Participant annual charge will be divided by 12 and billed monthly to each Participant's account during the fiscal year. A Participant will be billed only for months in which he or she has an account balance in the Plan. The monthly charges will appear on the Participant's quarterly statement. Employees who become Participants in the Plan during the fiscal year will be charged the same monthly per-Participant charge determined prior to the beginning of the fiscal year by the Administrative Committee. Until such time as the Administrative Committee approves a new annual fee, Participants will be charged the same monthly per-Participant charge as previously set by the Administrative Committee. The Administrative Committee may assess an emergency surcharge to Participants' accounts if it reasonably determines that actual Plan expenses authorized by this subsection will exceed the estimated annual fees determined prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
B.
Expenses incurred by members of the Administrative Committee as a result of performing their duties under the Plan will be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the member incurring such expense. Such expenses may include the costs of educational materials or classes relating to Plan administration or investments if the Administrative Committee determines that such costs are reasonable and necessary.
C.
TPA, Trustee fees and investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds are limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board of Supervisors, and will be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the County. The expenses, fees and costs so charged will be allocated to the individual Participants' accounts and shall be reflected on quarterly statements. Fees incident to investments in specific Brokerage Investments available through the Personal Brokerage Account Window are not limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board of Supervisors.
D.
In the event that the Plan accumulates (1) fees in excess of actual administrative expenses, or (2) unallocated earnings from Plan operations, or (3) any amounts transferred from the contingency and expense reserve established under Section 5.23.080.I.3 of the Deferred Earnings Plan as a result of the merger of the Deferred Earnings Plan into this Plan, the Administrative Committee shall allocate excess fees and earnings first by establishing a reserve for contingencies and payment of planned obligations not to exceed one-half of the total annual fees (other than TPA fees) charged to Participants, and then by allocating any remainder by reducing TPA fees charged to Participants or other administrative fees paid by the County by a method determined by the Administrative Committee.

A.
Initial Claim. Any Participant or Beneficiary who believes that he or she is entitled to receive a benefit under the Plan must file an application as provided in Section 5.26.240
B.
Appeal. If an application for benefits is denied, the Participant or Beneficiary will be advised of his or her right to appeal the denial to the Administrative Committee. The Participant or Beneficiary may appeal the denial to his or her application by filing with the Administrative Committee a written request for review of such claim stating the specific facts supporting his or her claim and specifying the remedy sought. The appeal shall be reviewed by agents of the Administrative Committee. If the agents determine that the claim is valid, benefits shall be distributed as soon as administratively feasible in accordance with the terms of the Plan. If, however, such agents recommend denial of the claim, such appeal shall be reviewed by the Administrative Committee at its next open meeting. The determination of the Administrative Committee as to the denial of a claim on appeal shall be final and binding to the extent permitted by law.

To the extent permitted by law and except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no right or interest of any kind of a Participant or Beneficiary hereunder shall be transferable or assignable by the Participant or Beneficiary, nor shall any such right or interest be subject to alienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind, voluntary or involuntary.
(Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)
5.26.465 - Rights of an Alternate Payee Under a QDRO.
A.
Notwithstanding Section 5.26.460, an Alternate Payee shall have the right to make a claim for any benefits awarded to the Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO as provided in this section. If an Alternate Payee is awarded a specified interest in the Account of the Participant pursuant to a QDRO, such interest of the Alternate Payee shall be segregated and separately accounted for by the Trustee in the name and for the benefit of the Alternate Payee.
B.
Upon receipt of a domestic relations order, or, if earlier, written notice that a domestic relations order may be sought, the Administrative Committee shall suspend distributions from the Participant's Account, and shall take steps to ensure that the Participant and each Alternate Payee is aware of the order or proposed order and the suspension of distributions from the Participant's Account. Moreover, the Administrative Committee shall determine, within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, whether such order is a QDRO. If the order is determined to be a QDRO, the Alternate Payee's interest under such order shall be segregated and/or distributed in accordance with the QDRO and this Section 5.26.465. The suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Account shall be discontinued only in accordance with a QDRO, a court order demonstrating that no benefits have been awarded to the Alternate Payee, or other documentation as determined by the Plan Administrator.
C.
Distributions to the Alternate Payee shall be made in accordance with the QDRO provided that the QDRO does not conflict with the Plan's distribution provisions or the provisions of this section. Regardless of whether the Participant is eligible to take a distribution under the Plan, the QDRO may provide for an immediate distribution of the Alternate Payee's interest thereunder to the Alternate Payee. If a QDRO does not provide the form of distribution of benefits payable to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee shall have the right to elect distribution in any form provided under this section. Pursuant to the QDRO or the Alternate Payee's election, the Alternate Payee's interest may be distributed in any form of payment available to the Participant; provided, however, that such payments shall be made in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) and applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
D.
Segregation of Alternate Payee's Interest.
1.
The Alternate Payee's interest specified in the QDRO shall be segregated and/or distributed from the Participant's Accounts, and the Core Funds in which such Accounts are invested, on a pro rata basis. If the assets invested in the Core Funds are insufficient to satisfy the QDRO, the Administrative Committee may transfer amounts from the Personal Brokerage Account Window to the Core Funds as necessary.
2.
Notwithstanding subsection D.1. of this Section 5.26.465, a QDRO may provide for an in-kind division and/or distribution of securities held through the Personal Brokerage Account Window subject to the following requirements: (1) the Participant's Account is 100% vested and nonforfeitable; (2) the Alternate Payee is the Participant's former spouse, (3) the QDRO clearly states the number of shares and the identities of the securities awarded to the Alternate Payee; and (3) either: (a) if the amounts are remaining in the Alternate Payee's Account under the Plan, the Alternate Payee must enter his own contract with the Broker to open a brokerage account through the Personal Brokerage Account Window, or (b) if the amounts are to be distributed in-kind, the Alternate Payee must request, or the QDRO must provide for, a full distribution of the Alternate Payee's Account from both Core Funds and the Personal Brokerage Account Window and the distribution must be made in the form of a direct rollover to an "eligible retirement plan" as authorized in section 5.26.610 and such Eligible Retirement Plan must accept the in-kind rollover.
E.
Following the determination that a domestic relations order is a QDRO, and segregation of an Alternate Payee's interest, the Alternate Payee shall have the right to direct the investment of his or her interest in the same manner as provided under Section 5.26.200 with respect to the Participant. The Participant shall continue to have the right to direct the investment of the portion of his or her Account that is not awarded to the Alternate Payee pursuant to the QDRO.
F.
Unless the QDRO provides otherwise, an Alternate Payee shall have the right, in the same manner as a Participant, to designate a Beneficiary, who shall receive benefits payable to the Alternate Payee in the event that all of the Alternate Payee's benefits have not been distributed at the time of the Alternate Payee's death. If the Alternate Payee does not designate a Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary predeceases the Alternate Payee, benefits payable to the Alternate Payee which have not been distributed shall be paid to the Alternate Payee's estate. Any death benefits payable under this section shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the Alternate Payee's death, with or without the Beneficiary's request.
(Ord. 2010-0063 § 13, 2010; Ord. 2009-0040 § 15, 2009; Ord. 2008-0071 § 10, 2008; Ord. 2004-0064 §§ 1, 2 (part), 2004.)

Whenever any Participant entitled to benefits under the Plan shall be under a legal disability or, in the sole judgment of the Administrative Committee, shall otherwise be unable to apply benefits to his own best interest and advantage, the Trustee, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, may make payments to the Participant's legal representative, and the decision of the Administrative Committee shall completely discharge the liability of the Plan, the Administrative Committee, the County and the Trustee with respect to such benefits.

5.26.530 - Vesting on Termination.

5.26.540 - Failure to Qualify Under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Plan shall be subject to the issuance by the Internal Revenue Service of either (1) a determination or ruling to the effect that the Plan as amended and restated (and as modified by any amendment thereto made for the purpose of securing such determination or ruling) meets the applicable requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code for a qualified governmental plan containing a qualified cash or deferred arrangement, or (2) a determination or ruling with respect to the Plan that is acceptable to the County. If the County does not receive such a determination or ruling within 12 months after it requests it or, if earlier, within 24 months after the Plan is amended and restated by the County, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the County may elect to declare the Plan to be retroactively void as of the date of the amendment and restatement by giving written notice to the Trustee that no such Internal Revenue Service determination or ruling has been received.
If, upon request by the County for a determination or ruling, the Internal Revenue Service determines that the adoption of Part 5 and the related provisions of the Plan adversely affect the Plan's qualified status, or that Termination Pay Contributions made pursuant to Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreements are not "picked up" within the meaning of Code Section 414(h)(2), then the County may declare Part 5 of the Plan void as of the date of its adoption by giving notice to the Trustee and cause the refund of Termination Pay Contributions and the earnings thereon to the Participants.

Part 12 - ROLLOVERS
Sections:

5.26.610 - Rollovers and Plan-to-Plan Transfers.
A.
Rollovers from Other Plans.
1.
The Trustee or its authorized agent shall, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, receive and thereafter hold and administer as part of the Account for a Participant all cash and other property that constitute an Eligible Rollover Distribution if such Eligible Rollover Distribution is either (a) received in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, or (b) transferred by the Participant to the Trustee or its authorized agent on or before the 60th day after he received such Eligible Rollover Distribution (a "Rollover Contribution"). For purposes of this Section 5.26.610A, the Plan will accept Rollover Contributions that are made on or after January 1, 2002, from the following "eligible retirement plans": (a) an individual retirement account under Code Section 408(a); (b) a "conduit" individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(d)(3)(A)(2); (c) an individual retirement annuity under Code Section 408(b); (d) an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a); (e) a defined contribution plan which is qualified under Code Section 401(a); (f) an annuity contract under Code Section 403(b); and (g) an eligible deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The Plan will accept an Eligible Rollover Distribution on or after January 1, 2002 which includes a distribution of after-tax employee contributions, provided the Rollover Contribution is made in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer. The Plan will accept an Eligible Rollover Distribution on or after January 1, 2002 that is attributable to the Participant's status as a surviving spouse. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Plan shall not accept as a Rollover Contribution any amount distributed from a designated Roth account (as defined in section 402A of the Code) or from a Roth IRA (as defined in section 408A of the Code).
2.
The Administrative Committee may take any action and may require the Participant to provide any information or documentation necessary to permit the Administrative Committee to satisfy any obligation imposed on the Administrative Committee by the Code and the regulations thereunder to make a reasonable determination that the Eligible Rollover Distribution satisfies the requirements of the Code and the terms of the Plan. The Committee may instruct the Trustee or its authorized agent not to accept the contribution if it does not satisfy such requirements or if it would otherwise jeopardize the qualified status of the Plan.
3.
An Eligible Rollover Distribution received by the Plan shall be held in the Participant's Rollover Contributions Account (which shall include one or more record-keeping subaccounts for purposes of separately accounting for Rollover Contributions from an eligible deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and the nontaxable portion of a Rollover Contributions that include after-tax contributions) and invested in accordance with the Participant's instructions in accordance with Section 5.26.200
B.
Rollovers from the Plan.
1.
A Participant who is entitled to receive an Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Plan, may direct the Administrative Committee to have the distribution transferred in a lump sum directly to the trustee of one of the following "eligible retirement plans": (a) an individual retirement account under Code section 408(a); (b) an individual retirement annuity under Code section 408(b); (c) an annuity plan described in Code section 403(a); or (d) a plan which is qualified under Code section 401(a) and permits the acceptance of rollover contributions. Effective for any distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, the term "eligible retirement plan" also shall include: (y) an annuity contract under Code section 403(b), and (z) an eligible deferred compensation plan under Code section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from the Plan. Effective for any distributions made on or after January 1, 2008, the term "eligible retirement plan" also shall include: a Roth IRA under Code section 408A. A direct rollover from the Plan will be offered only for distributions that would be Eligible Rollover Distributions without regard to Code section 401(a)(9)(H).
2.
In order for a transfer to be made with respect to a Participant under this section, (a) the Participant must designate in writing the eligible retirement plan to receive the transferred amounts; (b) the Participant must timely provide the Administrative Committee with adequate information to enable the Administrative Committee to determine that the transferee plan is an eligible retirement plan described above; (c) the entire amount to be transferred must be an Eligible Rollover Distribution; and (d) the Participant must have received proper notice in accordance with Code Section 402(f).
3.
For distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of After-Tax Contributions. However, such portion may be transferred only (a) to an individual retirement account under Code Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity under Code Section 408(b), or (b) in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a) or a defined contribution plan which is qualified under Code Section 401(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.
4.
For distributions made after December 31, 1992, a Participant's surviving spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution on the Participant's death under Section 5.26.270 of the Plan or an Alternate Payee who is a Participant's spouse or former spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution under Section 5.26.465 of the Plan shall be treated as the Participant for purposes of this section, except that the term "eligible retirement plan" shall not include an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a) or a defined contribution plan which is qualified under Code Section 401(a). For distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, a Participant's surviving spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution on the Participant's death under Section 5.26.270 of the Plan or an Alternate Payee who is a Participant's spouse or former spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution under Section 5.26.465 of the Plan shall be treated as the Participant for purposes of this section. A Participant's surviving Beneficiary who is not a spouse and becomes eligible to receive a distribution on the Participant's death under Section 5.26.270 of the Plan, may elect a direct trustee-to-trustee rollover to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity under (as defined in section 408 of the Code) established to receive such distribution in accordance with Code section 402(c)(11).
C.
Transfers from this Plan to a Successor 401(k) Plan. The Account of a Participant who is eligible to participate in (a) a qualified defined contribution plan including a qualified cash or deferred arrangement maintained by an entity determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be a successor employer to the County, or (b) a qualified defined contribution plan including a cash or deferred arrangement that is determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be a successor plan to this Plan such that it is treated as adopted before May 7, 1986 by a state or local government, its political subdivision, or its agency or instrumentality, (referred to herein as a "Successor CODA Plan"), shall be liquidated and transferred to the Successor CODA Plan in accordance with the procedures implemented by the Administrative Committee; provided that:
1.
Any balance owing and obligations of a loan under this Plan shall become the balance owing and obligations due to the Successor CODA Plan, which shall assume the Participant's note; and
2.
Vesting credit and benefit distribution rights accrued in this Plan shall be transferred to the Successor CODA Plan.
D.
Trustee-to-Trustee Transfers to Purchase Permissive Service Credit and as Repayment of Contributions and Interest.
1.
Notwithstanding Sections 5.26.240 and 5.26.300, effective on or after September 1, 2007, a Participant may direct the Administrative Committee to make a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer of all or part of the Participant's Accounts, to the extent vested, to a defined benefit governmental plan (as defined in Code section 414(d)) in California if such transfer is (a) for the purchase of service or retirement credit that may be purchased under the terms of such defined benefit governmental plan, or (b) a repayment of contributions (including interest thereon) that may be made under the terms of such defined benefit governmental plan with respect to an amount previously refunded upon a forfeiture of service credit under the plan or under another governmental plan maintained by a State or local government employer.
2.
Unless the Participant directs otherwise, transfers shall be made pro rata from each subaccount within the Participant's Account and from each Investment Fund in which those subaccounts are invested.
3.
The Administrative Committee may take any action and may require the Participant to provide any information or documentation necessary to permit the Administrative Committee to satisfy any obligation imposed on the Administrative Committee by the Code and the regulations thereunder to make a reasonable determination that the trustee-to-trustee transfer satisfies the requirements of the Code and the terms of the Plan and will be accepted by the transferee plan.
E.
Certain Prior Trustee-to-Trustee Transfers to Purchase Permissive Service Credit and as Repayment of Contributions and Interest.
