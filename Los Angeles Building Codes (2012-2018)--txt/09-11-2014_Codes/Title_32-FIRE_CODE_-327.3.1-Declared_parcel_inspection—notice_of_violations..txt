327.3.1 - Declared parcel inspection—notice of violations.
A physical inspection of the declared parcel is conducted by the fire department to determine compliance with the declaration card. After the physical inspection, if the fire department determines that the owner has not complied with the declaration card, then such noncompliance constitutes the first violation of the fire code. The owner will be given notice of such first violation of the fire code. This notice constitutes the second official notice to the owner.
The second official notice shall also inform the owner that an administrative fine may be imposed on the declared parcel if not properly cleared. An owner's failure to comply with the second official notice constitutes the second violation of the fire code.
