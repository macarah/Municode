Appendix A - RENT STABILIZATION REGULATIONS
Parts:
Part 1 - CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
RENT ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
(August 6, 1979)
I.
Definitions.
1.
A capital improvement as defined in Ordinance 11950 is: "The addition or replacement of the following improvements to a rental unit or common areas of the housing complex containing the rental unit, provided such new improvement has a useful life of five years or more: roofing, carpeting, draperies, stuccoing the outside of a building, air conditioning, security gates, swimming pool, sauna or hot tub, fencing, garbage disposal, washing machine or clothes dryer (coin-operated are not eligible, see II. Eligibility No. 3), dishwasher, children's play equipment permanently installed on the premises, and other similar improvements as determined by the Regional Planning Department."
2.
Additional similar items not listed in Ordinance 11950 may be allowable capital improvements when they conform to the following principles:
(a)
The improvement must primarily benefit the tenant rather than the landlord. For example, the remodeling of the lobby would be eligible as a capital improvement, while the construction of a sign advertising the rental complex would not be eligible.
(b)
The improvement must have a life expectancy of five years or more.
(c)
Equipment eligible as costs for which a capital improvement rent increase can be made must be permanently fixed in place or relatively immobile (e.g., sinks, bathtubs, stoves, refrigerators, kitchen cabinets are items eligible as capital improvement).
(d)
Normal routine maintenance and repair of the rental unit and the building is not capital improvement while replacement of old screens with new screens would be a capital improvement.
(e)
In the case of painting, the complete painting of the complete exterior of the building and/or the painting of the common interior area (interior walls and corridors) are eligible as a capital improvement. The repainting of an individual apartment is considered normal maintenance.
(f)
In establishing the cost of a capital improvement, the landlord must be able to prove the actual value through adequate and reliable documentation. The landlord may transfer the landlord's personal appliances, furniture, etc., or those inherited or borrowed from friends. However, the fair market value must be established in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
II.
Eligibility.
1.
Only capital improvements completed on or after April 1, 1978 are eligible for a capital improvement rent increase.
2.
The eligibility of any particular improvement included in the landlord's application for a rent increase based on capital improvements will be determined by the Rent Adjustment Panel.
3.
Capital improvements otherwise eligible for a rent increase are not eligible if the landlord charges a "use fee." An example of this would be a landlord-owned washer and dryer in a common area where the tenants must deposit coins to use the equipment. Since the equipment will be paid for by this fee system, the landlord may not include such a request for a rent raise based on capital improvements.
4.
Ordinance 11950 does not require any approval by tenants or the Rent Adjustment Commission prior to the landlord making a capital improvement.
III.
Determination of extraordinary rent increase
1.
Capital improvement costs must be circulated on the basis of actual cost. Cancelled checks, receipts, invoices, social security payments, and W-2 forms are among the types of evidence that will be required to substantiate such costs.
2.
Labor provided by the landlord, the landlord's family, the landlord's agent or agent's family, may be billed at a reasonable cost as a part of any capital improvement, unless said persons are employees of the landlord, whose costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
3.
Labor costs of a manager, maintenance men, or other employees of the landlord may be included as a part of the capital improvement cost unless said costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
4.
Interest on money borrowed to pay for capital improvements work shall be included as a part of the capital improvement cost. In those cases where the landlord finances the capital improvement costs or a part thereof with his own funds, interest at the legal rate of interest set forth in Civil Code Section 1916-1 (at 7 percent as of July 1, 1979), valued over a reasonable amount of time, shall be included as a part of the capital improvement cost. The landlord shall have the burden of proof in establishing the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed. In determining the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed, the Rent Adjustment Panel shall be principally guided by the current practices of state and federally chartered banks and savings and loan associations.
5.
In the event a landlord receives net compensation for any portion of the money spent on capital improvements (insurance, court-awarded damages, federal or state subsidies, etc.), this compensation must be deducted from the cost of the capital improvements before amortizing the costs among the units.
6.
In the event that the net compensation described in No. 5 above is received after the landlord receives approval for an extraordinary rent increase, but within the life of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, the landlord shall immediately reduce rents prospectively on a per-unit basis by amortizing said net compensation over a 60-month period.
7.
In determining the Average Per Unit Capital Improvement Cost, the cost of the capital improvement shall be divided by the number of units affected by the improvement, irrespective of whether all of such units are subject to Ordinance 11950.
Part 2 - REHABILITATION
RENT ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO REHABILITATION WORK
(August 6, 1979)
I.
Definition. .....Rehabilitation or repair work done on or in a rental unit or common areas of the housing complex containing the rental unit and which work was done in order to comply with an order issued by the County Engineer, the Public Health or the Fire Departments, or to repair damage resulting from fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster.
(Ord. 2006-0040 ยง 35 (part), 2006.)
II.
Eligibility requirements.
1.
Only rehabilitation work completed on or after April 1, 1978, is eligible for an extraordinary rent increase.
2.
Any portion of the rehabilitation work completed before April 1, 1978, is ineligible for a rent increase under this category unless the landlord can prove that the work completed before April 1st was intrinsically connected with rehabilitation work that was completed on or after April 1st. (For example: if the plastering of a wall was finished on March 25th but the painter did not paint the wall until April 2nd, both the plasterer's and painter's costs would be eligible. However, if roof repairs were completed on March 29th but a new vented heater wasn't installed until April 3rd, the heater would be eligible but the roof repair would not.)
3.
Any work performed, not mandated by the order of the County Engineer, the County Public Health Department, or the County Fire Department, or not connected with the repair of damage resulting from fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster, is ineligible under this category although it might be eligible under Capital Improvement Rent Increases. See the Capital Improvement Guidelines for further information.
(Ord. 2006-0040 ยง 35 (part), 2006.)
III.
Determination of extraordinary rent increase.
1.
Rehabilitation costs must be calculated on the basis of actual cost. Cancelled checks, receipts, invoices, social security payments and W-2 forms are among the types of evidence that will be required to substantiate such costs.
2.
Labor provided by the landlord, the landlord's family, the landlord's agent or agent's family, may be billed at a reasonable cost as part of any rehabilitation work, unless said persons are employees of the landlord, whose costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
3.
Labor costs of a manager, maintenance men or other employees of the landlord may be included as a part of the rehabilitation work cost unless said costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
4.
Interest on money borrowed to pay for rehabilitation work shall be included as a part of the rehabilitation work cost. In those cases where the landlord finances the rehabilitation work costs or a part thereof with his own funds, interest at the legal rate of interest set forth in Civil Code Section 1916-1 (at 7 percent as of July 1, 1979), valued over a reasonable amount of time, shall be included as a part of the rehabilitation work cost. The landlord shall have the burden of proof in establishing the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed. In determining the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed, the Rent Adjustment Panel shall be principally guided by the current practices of state and federally chartered banks and savings and loan associations.
5.
In the event a landlord receives net compensation for any portion of the money spent on rehabilitation work (insurance, court awarded damages, federal or state subsidies, etc.), this compensation must be deducted from the cost of the rehabilitation work before amortizing the costs among the units.
6.
In the event that the net compensation described in No. 5 above is received after the landlord receives approval for an extraordinary rent increase, but within the life of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, the landlord shall immediately reduce rents prospectively on a per-unit basis by amortizing said net compensation over a 60-month period.
7.
In determining the Average Per Unit Rehabilitation Cost, the cost of the rehabilitation work shall be divided by the number of units affected by the work, irrespective of whether all of such units are subject to Ordinance 11950.
Part 3 - REASONABLE RETURN
RENT ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVIDE FOR A JUST AND REASONABLE RETURN
(August 6, 1979)
1.
The Rent Regulation Ordinance contains a number of provisions assuring a just and reasonable return on rental units subject to the Ordinance. These provisions include:
(a)
Automatic increases over the applicable base rent (Section 8.52.040);
(b)
Automatic rent increases to permit the pass through of an increase in the cost of gas, water, sewer charges, and/or electricity;
(c)
Vacancy decontrol;
(d)
Exemption of luxury units;
(e)
Pass through of capital improvement costs;
(f)
Pass through of rehabilitation work costs.
2.
In most cases, the automatic increases allowed by Ordinance 11950 and the property tax savings resulting from Proposition 13 provide sufficient additional operating income to property owners to maintain an adequate return on their units. However, in some cases, the limitations imposed on property owners by the Rent Regulation Ordinance may prevent such owners from realizing a just and reasonable return. In those cases, the owner may qualify for an extraordinary rent increase pursuant to the guidelines set forth herein.
3.
The following factors may be considered in determining whether a rental unit yields a just and reasonable return:
(a)
Property taxes;
(b)
Reasonable operating and maintenance expenses;
(c)
Debt service expenses (principal and interest);
(d)
The extent to which expenses may be reimbursed;
(e)
The extent of capital improvements made to the building in which a rental unit is located as distinguished from ordinary repair, replacement, and maintenance.
4.
With respect to debt service, such expenses (principal and interest) shall be recognized only to the extent that the level of debt and the terms of financing are reasonable and consistent with current practices of state and federally chartered banks and savings and loan associations.
5.
To the extent that the maximum rents permitted by Ordinance 11950 do not allow the landlord return sufficient to pay both operating expenses and debt service, a rent adjustment may be allowed to the extent necessary to eliminate a negative cash flow, provided all expenses and debt service are reasonable and consistent with the Ordinance and this guideline.
6.
In determining whether a rental unit yields a just and reasonable return, the income and expenses of all portions of the building used for residential purposes and common areas shall be considered, irrespective of whether all of such building and common areas are subject to the Ordinance. In those instances where another business is conducted on the premises, only that income and expense connected with the rental units shall be considered. For example, if there is a restaurant operating on the premises and 10 percent of the total maintenance effort is associated with operating the restaurant, 10 percent of the maintenance expense shall be excluded from the calculations. In those cases where the landlord's accounting methods do not allocate expenses among the separate businesses, the landlord may submit such expenses based upon a good faith estimate.
7.
Expense data submitted may be subject to comparisons with industry-wide standards in determining the reasonableness of operating expenses.
8.
As to properties acquired by the landlord after July 1, 1979, no extraordinary rent increase will be permitted if the only justification offered on the landlord's application is an assertion that the maximum rents permitted by the Ordinance do not allow the landlord return sufficient to pay both operating expenses and debt service.
