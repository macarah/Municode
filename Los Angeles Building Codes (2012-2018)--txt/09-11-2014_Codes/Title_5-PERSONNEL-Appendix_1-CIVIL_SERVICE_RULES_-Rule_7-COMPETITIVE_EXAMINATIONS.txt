Upon receipt of such protests, a review of each protested question shall be made by the director of personnel. Any errors, improprieties or ambiguities disclosed shall be corrected. In case of an ambiguity in a question, the director of personnel may eliminate the question entirely or may allow more than one answer as correct. After the necessary and proper corrections have been made, the answer key, as corrected, shall become the basis for a scoring key upon which all the applicants' papers are finally scored. An applicant who has not filed a protest during the key-copy inspection period shall not be entitled to protest against the written test except on the grounds of specific error in the application of the scoring key.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)

If the applicant believes an error has been made in the application of the written-test scoring key, or in the rating given him/her on any part of the examination, or that any other error has been made, except such as could have been objected to during the key-copy inspection period, the applicant may, during the final 10-day period referred to in Rule 7.19, make a protest in writing stating specifically where an error has been made; provided, however, that if there has been a key-copy inspection period, no protest may be made against the written questions and key answers which would have been made during the key-copy inspection period. Each protest shall be in writing and on forms provided by the director of personnel, shall give specific facts and reasons to support the protest, and shall include authoritative references or opinions of recognized experts where such exist. No protest may be made after the 10-day period. Upon receipt of a written protest or request for re-scoring or re-rating, a review of the protest shall be made by the director of personnel, who shall pass on all such protests or requests within 60 days of the date of such protest or request and make any necessary corrections in grades and ratings.

Any person aggrieved may appeal to the commission for the rulings of the director of personnel pursuant to Rule 4, within 10 business days of the notice of such rulings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in a situation where a successful appeal will not result in the appellant moving from one group (as defined in Rule 11.01) to a higher group, the appellant will not proceed with the appeal to the civil service commission.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988: amended by Board Order No. 80 (part), 9/1/87.)
