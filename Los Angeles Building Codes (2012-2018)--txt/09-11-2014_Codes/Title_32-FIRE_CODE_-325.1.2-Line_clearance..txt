325.1.2 - Line clearance.
Any person owning, controlling, operating, or maintaining any electrical transmission or distribution line upon any mountainous, or forest, or brush-covered lands, or lands covered with flammable growth shall maintain a clearance of the respective distances hereinafter in this section specified in all directions between all vegetation and all conductors carrying electrical current.
For lines operating at 2,400 volts or more, but less than 72,000 volts, four (4) feet;
For lines operating at 72,000 volts or more, but less than 110,000 volts, six (6) feet; and
For lines operating at 110,000 volts or more, ten (10) feet.
In any case, such distance shall be sufficiently great to furnish the required clearance from the particular wire or conductor at any position, of such wire or conductor at any temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit or less. Dead trees, old, decadent, or rotten trees, those weakened by decay or disease, and trees leaning toward the line, which may contact the line from the side or may fall on the line, shall be felled, cut or trimmed so as to remove the hazard.
