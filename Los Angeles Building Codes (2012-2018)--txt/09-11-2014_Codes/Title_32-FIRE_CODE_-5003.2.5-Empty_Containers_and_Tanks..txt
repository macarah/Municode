Empty containers and tanks previously used for the storage of hazardous materials shall be free from residual material and vapor as defined by DOT, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), or other regulating authority or maintained as specified for the storage of the hazardous material. Containers larger than five gallons in capacity shall be marked with the date they have been emptied and shall be reclaimed, reconditioned, or remanufactured within one year of being emptied. Containers which previously held acute or extremely hazardous materials are considered empty if the container has been triple-rinsed and the rinsate managed as a hazardous waste. If the activity does not qualify for an exemption, the activity may require a permit to treat on site.
