(Ord. 89-0053 § 1 (part), 1989.)

As used herein, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings respectively, unless the context otherwise requires:
A.
"Dependent" means the Participant's spouse to whom he or she is legally married and a Participant's tax dependent (as defined in Code Section 152, determined without regard to Section 152(b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B)). Dependent shall also mean a Participant's child (as defined in Code section 152(f)(1)) who has not attained age 26 as of the end of the taxable year. A child of a divorced or separated Employee to whom Code Section 152(e) applies shall be considered a Dependent of both parents in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2008-48 or subsequent guidance. Domestic partners, children or other relatives who are not Dependents as defined herein are not covered by the Health Care Spending Account.
B.
"Election Information" means the information and rules relating to the general administration of the Health Care Spending Account, which may include, but is not limited to, rules relating to election procedures and deadlines, rules relating to the administration of benefits for Participants who enter or exit the Choices Plan during a Plan Year, or who experience an interruption of active service, and rules necessary to maintain the tax-favored status of the Health Care Spending Account and the Choices Plan through which it is offered. Such Election Information shall be developed by the Chief Executive Officer (except as otherwise provided by the Board).

"Health Care Spending Account" means an individual account established and maintained for a Participant to which Contributions are periodically credited pursuant to Section 5.33.060F of the Choices Plan and from which Medical Expenses are paid.

"Maximum Amount" means the Contribution amount selected by a Participant (on an election form furnished by the County) for credit to his Health Care Spending Account for the Plan Year; provided, however, that such amount shall not exceed $125.00 per month during the Plan Year commencing on July 1, 1989, and $400.00 per month during each subsequent Plan Year. Effective January 1, 2013, as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the maximum allowable employee contribution for the Health Care Spending Account is reduced from $400 to $200 per month.

This definition is to be construed in accordance with Section 213(d)(1) of the Code.
F.

  Except as provided in Section 5.35.030D, an Eligible Employee must reenroll during open enrollment as provided in the Election Information and Materials in order to participate in the following Plan Year.

B.
Termination and Suspension of Participation. Participation in the Health Care Spending Account shall terminate or be suspended as provided in the Election Information and Materials.
(Ord. 2014-0008 § 20, 2014.)
5.35.030 - Payments under the Plan.
The County shall from time to time, upon request of a Participant made in writing not later than the end of the Run-Out Period, reimburse all or part of the Medical Expenses incurred by the Participant during such Plan Year; provided, however, that:
A.
All such payments during or in respect of a particular Plan Year to the Participant's Health Care Spending Account shall be limited in the aggregate to (a) his Maximum Amount; plus (b) the Carryover Amount described in Section 5.35.030B, subject to the rules in Section 5.35.030C.
B.
Subject to the rules in Section 5.35.030C below, amounts up to $500 that remain unused under the Health Care Spending Account with respect to one Plan Year are carried over to the next Plan Year. The carryover amount is the lesser of (a) any unused amounts from the immediately preceding Plan Year, or (b) $500 (the "Carryover Amount"). Any unused amount in the Health Care Spending Account in excess of the Carryover Amount that remains unused as of the last day of the Run-Out Period shall be forfeited.
C.
A Participant's unused balance under the Health Care Spending Account at the end of the prior Plan Year will be used either: (a) to reimburse expenses incurred during the prior Plan Year and submitted during the Run-Out Period that begins at the end of the prior Plan Year (thus retroactively reducing the unused amount as of the end of the prior Plan Year), or (b) to the extent of the Carryover Amount, for expenses that are incurred at any time during the current Plan Year. Any Carryover Amount used to reimburse a prior Plan Year's expense during the Run-Out Period will reduce the Carryover Amount that may be used for current Plan Year expenses, and any of the Carryover Amount used for current Plan Year expenses will reduce the amount available to reimburse the prior Plan Year's expenses during the applicable Run-Out Period. The Health Care Spending Account treats claims for Medical Expenses as reimbursed first from unused amounts credited for the current Plan Year and, only after exhausting such amounts, as reimbursed from the Carryover Amount. Any unused amounts from the prior Plan Year that are used to reimburse a current Plan Year expense: (a) reduce the amounts available to pay prior Plan Year expenses during the Run-Out Period; (b) are counted against the Carryover Amount; and (c) cannot exceed the Carryover Amount.
D.
Notwithstanding Section 5.35.025, a Participant in a Health Care Spending Account during one Plan Year who fails to enroll in the Health Care Spending Account for the following Plan Year on a timely basis will nevertheless have a Health Care Spending Account established for him for that following Plan Year to the extent of any Carryover Amount provided for in this Section 5.35.030.
E.
Payments hereunder may be made only upon such proof of the Medical Expenses in question as the County shall in its discretion require. It is not necessary that such Medical Expenses have been already paid by the Participant, his spouse or his dependents, but merely that, if not yet paid, there exists an obligation to pay them.
F.
Medical Expenses reimbursed by the Plan for a Plan Year must have been incurred during a period when the Participant (and Dependents) are covered by the Health Care Spending Account, as described in the Election Information and Materials, and submitted for reimbursement, with all required substantiation, before the end of the Run-Out Period. Accordingly, with regard to each Plan Year, the Health Care Spending Account will not reimburse any expenses incurred: (i) before the start of the Plan Year or, if later, before the date the Eligible Employee first becomes a Participant under Section 5.35.025; (ii) after the end of the Plan Year; (iii) after coverage terminates or while coverage is suspended as described in the Election Information and Materials, or (iv) that are not adequately substantiated before the end of the Run-Out Period.

5.35.050 - Administration of the Plan.
A.
Compliance with Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the County intends to administer the Plan under the direction of the Board so that Benefits payable hereunder will qualify for the exclusion from the gross income of Participants, as provided in Section 104 of the Code, and so that the Plan complies with other applicable federal law, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and state collective bargaining law.
B.
Contracted Services. The County may contract with one or more private firms for services related to the administration of the Plan.
(Ord. 89-0053 § 1 (part), 1989.)
5.35.060 - Amendment or termination of Plan.
The Plan may be amended from time to time hereafter or terminated at any time by the County without the advice or consent of any Participant, but such action shall not adversely affect the rights of any Participant hereunder with respect to any balance remaining in his Health Care Spending Account at the time of such termination.
(Ord. 89-0053 § 1 (part), 1989.)
5.35.070 - Nonalienation.
To the extent permitted by law and except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no right or interest of any kind of a Participant hereunder shall be transferable or assignable by him, nor shall any such right or interest be subject to alienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind, voluntary or involuntary.
(Ord. 89-0053 § 1 (part), 1989.)
5.35.080 - Construction of Plan.
Except to the extent that federal law applies, the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California. The CAO may interpret any ambiguous provisions of the Plan, correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency, in such manner and to such extent as the CAO in its discretion may determine; and any such action of the CAO shall be binding and conclusive upon all Participants. Wherever appropriate in the Plan, the masculine gender shall include the feminine, and the feminine gender the masculine, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
(Ord. 89-0053 § 1 (part), 1989.)
