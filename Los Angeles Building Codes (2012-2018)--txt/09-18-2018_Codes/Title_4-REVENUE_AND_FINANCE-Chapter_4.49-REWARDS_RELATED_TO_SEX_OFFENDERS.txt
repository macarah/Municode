Chapter 4.49 - REWARDS RELATED TO SEX OFFENDERS

4.49.010 - Findings.
A.
Federal, State, and local jurisdictions are often seeking the public's help in finding dangerous sex offenders who have either failed to report to their parole officer, cut off their Global Positioning System ankle bracelets or let their tracking devices' batteries die.
B.
In 2013, Operation Guardian, led by the U.S. Marshal Service, arrested 345 non-compliant and dangerous sex offenders. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged the use of local assistance in safeguarding abuse and exploitation of young people in our communities.
C.
In Los Angeles County, it has been reported that Global Positioning System warrants for sex offenders have increased up to seventy percent (70%).
D.
Sex offenders under active probation or parole supervision have to abide by certain terms and conditions of supervision which could be revoked if they fail to follow those terms and conditions, including tampering with their Global Positioning System ankle bracelets.
E.
Government Code section 26227 authorizes the board of supervisors of any county to appropriate and expend money from the general fund of the county to establish county programs or to fund other programs deemed by the board of supervisors to be necessary to meet the social needs of the population of the county, including but not limited to, the areas of law enforcement and public safety.
F.
The Board of Supervisors finds that sex offenders who abscond while on active parole or probation pose a significant risk to public safety in all communities in the County.
G.
The Board of Supervisors, therefore, finds that offering rewards in exchange for information leading to locating or apprehending sex offenders who abscond while on active parole or probation is necessary to meet the social needs of the population of the county in the area of law enforcement and public safety.
