101.2 - Purpose and Intent.
The purpose of this Code is to provide minimum standards to preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating the design, construction, installation, quality of materials, use, occupancy, location, and maintenance of all buildings, structures, grading, and certain equipment as specifically set forth herein. Consistent with this purpose, the provisions of this Code are intended and always have been intended to confer a benefit on the community as a whole and are not intended to establish a duty of care toward any particular person.
This Code shall not be construed to hold the County of Los Angeles or any officer, employee or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or nonissuance of any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or omission in connection with the application and/or enforcement of this Code. By adopting the provisions of this Code, the County does not intend to impose on itself, its employees or agents any mandatory duties of care toward persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages.
This Section is declaratory of existing law and is not to be construed as suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent of previous Code adoptions.
