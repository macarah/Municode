Chapter 11.19 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE WARNING SIGNS

11.19.010 - Alcoholic beverage warning signs—Purpose of provisions.
The Surgeon General of the United States has recommended that women who are pregnant, or considering pregnancy, be advised not to drink alcoholic beverages and to be aware of the alcohol content in anything they eat because alcohol consumption during pregnancy, especially in the early months, can harm the fetus. In order to serve the public health, safety and welfare, the purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter is to educate the public by requiring that warning signs be placed at all locations where alcoholic beverages are sold to the public.
