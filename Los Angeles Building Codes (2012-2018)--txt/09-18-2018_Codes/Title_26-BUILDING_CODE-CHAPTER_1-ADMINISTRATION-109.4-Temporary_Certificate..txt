109.4 - Temporary Certificate.
If the Building Official finds that no substantial hazard will result from occupancy of any building or portion thereof before the same is completed, the Building Official may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for the use of a portion or portions of a building or structure prior to the completion of the entire building or structure. A request for issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy must be made in writing.
Such temporary certificate of occupancy shall be valid for a period not to exceed three months. Upon request of the owner or permittee the Building Official may, in writing, extend the temporary certificate of occupancy when it is determined that the circumstances so warrant. After the expiration of a temporary certificate of occupancy and any extension(s) thereof, the building or structure shall not be used or occupied until the Building Official has approved the building for such use or occupancy.
