19.12.1100 - Toilet Fixtures—Use Prohibited.
A.
Vessel's Toilet Fixtures Not to be Used. No person shall operate the toilet fixtures of a vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility within a County harbor, waterway, or maritime facility at any time so as to cause or permit to pass or to be discharged into the waters of such harbor, waterway, or maritime facility any excrement, treated or untreated sewage, or other waste matter or contaminant of any kind.
B.
Toilet fixtures of any vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility must employ either a self-contained portable toilet or a federally-approved marine sanitation device, which has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the harbor master to prohibit the overboard discharge of excrement, treated or untreated sewage, or other waste matter or contaminant of any kind while within the Marina del Rey Small Craft Harbor.
C.
If a vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility has a sanitation device, which allows direct overboard discharge of excrement, treated or untreated sewage, or other waste matter or contaminant of any kind, it must be secured while moored in or using the waters of the harbor, waterway, or maritime facility, so that overboard discharge is prevented. Acceptable methods of securing such device include:
1.
Closing the seacock and removing the handle;
2.
Padlocking the seacock in the closed position;
3.
Using a non-releasable wire-tie to hold the seacock in the closed position; or
4.
Locking the door to the space enclosing the toilet(s) with a padlock or door handle key lock.
D.
Toilet fixtures of any vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility may be sealed by the harbor master, unless such fixtures can be operated in compliance with subsections A, B, and C of Section 19.12.1100 of this code at all times when the vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility remains in the harbor.
E.
The owner of any vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility not equipped with approved and acceptable devices for the neutralization or storage of contaminants shall post notices that the toilet facilities aboard shall not be used while the vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility is moored in or using the waters of the harbor, waterway, or maritime facility.
(Ord. 2018-0021 § 9, 2018: Ord. 99-0016 § 4, 1999; Ord. 95-0043 § 5, 1995: Ord. 86-0039 § 44, 1986: Ord. 10783 § 2, 1973: Ord. 9359 Art. 7 § 705, 1967.)
19.12.1110 - Use of Vessel as Place of Abode—Restrictions.
A.
No person shall, within a County harbor, waterway, or maritime facility, use any vessel, floating home, houseboat, or any other floating facility as an abode in excess of three days within any one-week period unless such person shall first have authorization by the lessee, agent, manager, or person in charge of such facility for a liveaboard status, and secondly, have obtained a liveaboard permit from the harbor master. The liveaboard permit shall establish compliance by such vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility with the requirements for seaworthiness, as described in Section 19.12.1060 of this code, unless otherwise exempted or temporarily excused by the provisions of that section, and the requirements for toilet fixtures, as described in subsection O of Section 19.12.110.
If it is determined by the harbor master that the criteria for issuance of a liveaboard permit have been satisfactorily met, the harbor master shall issue a liveaboard decal which shall be prominently placed, as directed by the harbor master, on the vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility. Liveaboard permits shall be valid for a period of one (1) year commencing with the first day of the month following the month of issuance and shall be renewed on each successive annual anniversary of the previous term's commencement date. Any renewal of a liveaboard permit shall be issued by the harbor master upon the same terms as required for the initial permit. In the case of a floating home, no annual renewal of a liveaboard permit shall be issued after July 31, 2018, unless the owner provides the harbor master with his or her statement, made under penalty of perjury, that no transfer of ownership, as defined by subsection B.2 of Section 19.12.1060, has occurred with respect to that floating home since July 31, 2018. Failure to have obtained such a liveaboard permit shall be a violation of Part 7 of this chapter.
B.
The Director and/or harbor master may promulgate such additional regulations in connection with vessels used as abodes, as may be necessary to ensure the maintenance of sanitary and sightly conditions, as determined by the Director and/or the harbor master, and the preservation and protection of the public health, safety, peace, welfare, and convenience in the use of any County harbor, waterway, or maritime facility, or portion thereof. A violation of any part of such regulations shall be cause for revocation for use of any vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility as an abode, and it shall be unlawful for any person to live aboard such vessel, floating home, houseboat, or other floating facility until such violation has been corrected to the satisfaction of the Director and/or the harbor master.
