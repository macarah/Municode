Chapter 21.20 - SURVEYS

21.20.010 - Standards for survey work.
A.
The procedure and practice of all survey work done on any division of land, whether for preparation of a final map or parcel map, shall conform to the standards and details set forth in Chapter 15, Division 3, of the Business and Professions Code, the Land Surveyor's Act. The allowable error of closure on any portion of a final map or parcel map shall be 1/10,000.
B.
In the event that the county engineer, county road commissioner, the State Highway Engineer or any city engineer shall have established the centerline of any street or alley in or adjoining a division of land, the final map or parcel map shall show such centerline, together with reference to a field book or map showing such centerline and the monuments which determine its position. If determined by ties, that fact shall be stated upon the final map or parcel map.
(Ord. 9071 § 11 (part), 1966: Ord. 4478 Art. 7 § 111, 1945.)
21.20.020 - Boundary monuments—Location and materials.
Each final map or parcel map shall show durable monuments found or set at or near each boundary corner and at intermediate points, approximately 1,000 feet apart, or at such lesser distances as may be made necessary by topography or culture to insure accuracy in the reestablishment of any point or line without unreasonable difficulty. The precise position and the character of each such monument shall be shown on such map. Such durable monument shall be not less substantial than an iron pipe of a two-inch outside diameter, not less than two and one-half feet in length, with plug and tack, and set at least two feet into the ground, or of such other character and stability as may be approved by the county engineer. For the purpose of this Title 21, a lead and tack set in permanent concrete or masonry shall be considered as a durable monument. The approximate elevation of the top of each such monument with respect to the surface of the ground shall be shown on said map.
(Ord. 9071 § 11 (part), 1966: Ord. 4478 Art. 7 § 112, 1945.)
21.20.030 - Street centerline monuments.
A.
Whenever necessary in the opinion of the county surveyor, centerline monuments shall be set to mark the intersections of streets, intersections of streets with the tract boundary, or to mark either the beginning and end of curves or the points of intersection of tangents thereof, or other intermediate points.
B.
Each such monument shall be not less durable and substantial than:
1.
In asphaltic concrete or cement concrete pavements, a lead and track;
2.
In unsurfaced graveled or oiled surfaces, a two-inch iron pipe set not less than 12 inches below the surface, or at such depth as may be approved by the county surveyor;
3.
In bituminous macadam pavements, a spike not less than six inches long.
(Ord. 5584 § 4 (part) 1952: Ord. 4478 Art. 7 § 113, 1945.)
21.20.040 - Centerline intersection monuments—Notes to county surveyor.
A.
For each centerline intersection monument set, the engineer or surveyor under whose supervision the survey has been made shall furnish to the county surveyor a set of notes showing clearly the ties between such monument and a sufficient number (normally four) of durable distinctive reference points or monuments.
B.
Such reference points or monuments may be leads and tacks in sidewalks, or two-inch by two-inch stakes set back of the curbline and below the surface of the ground, or such substitute therefor as appears to be not more likely to be disturbed.
C.
Such set of notes shall be of such quality, form and completeness, and shall be on paper of such quality and size, as may be necessary to conform to the standardized office records of the county surveyor. All such notes shall be indexed and filed by the county surveyor as a part of the permanent public records of this office.
(Ord. 4478 Art. 7 § 114, 1945.)
21.20.050 - Identification marks on monuments.
All monuments found or set as required herein shall be permanently and visibly marked or tagged with the registration or license number of the engineer or surveyor under whose supervision the survey was made.
(Ord. 11665 § 30, 1978: Ord. 4478 Art. 7 § 115, 1945.)
21.20.060 - Boundary monuments—Time for setting—Deferment conditions.
All boundary monuments shall be set prior to filing of the final map or parcel map unless extensive grading operations or improvement work makes it impractical to set monuments. In the event any of the boundary monuments required are to be set subsequent to filing of the parcel map or final map, the engineer or surveyor making the survey shall furnish evidence acceptable to the county engineer prior to submitting the map to substantiate his reasons for deferring the setting of permanent monuments until after filing of the map. If the setting of boundary monuments is deferred, field notes showing the boundary survey shall be presented to the county engineer at the time the map is submitted for checking. Interior street-centerline monuments may be set subsequent to filing of the map. The map shall show which monuments are in place and are to be set. Prior to approval of the final map by the board of supervisors or of a parcel map by the advisory agency, the subdivider shall submit a written agreement in which he agrees that the monuments so deferred will be set within a specified time, and that the notes required in Section 21.20.050 will be furnished within a specified time.
(Ord. 11665 § 31, 1978: Ord. 8822 § 4, 1965: Ord. 8792 § 4, 1965: Ord. 5883 § 4 (part), 1952: Ord. 4478 Art. 7 § 116, 1945.)
21.20.070 - Inspection and approval of monuments.
All monuments shall be subject to inspection and approval of the county surveyor in conjunction with his checking of the map.
(Ord. 4478 Art. 7 § 117, 1945.)
21.20.080 - Record of survey checking fee.
A.
Where the county surveyor is required to check record of survey maps under the provisions of the Professional Land Surveyors Act, the surveyor shall pay a map checking fee to the county surveyor in addition to all other fees and charges required by law. These fees, payable on submission of map for checking to the county surveyor, shall be as follows:
1.
First sheet, $160.00;
2.
Each additional sheet, $55.00.
B.
This section applies to all records of survey checked by the county department of public works whether the property is within the unincorporated area or not.
(Ord. 91-0074 § 1, 1991.)
