Division 4 - WAGE REGULATIONS
Chapter 8.100 - MINIMUM WAGE

8.100.010 - Short Title.
The Ordinance codified in this Chapter shall be known as the "Los Angeles County Minimum Wage Ordinance."
(Ord. 2015-0039, § 3, 2015.)
8.100.020 - Findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds that, as of 2015, twenty seven percent (27%) of the overall population of the County of Los Angeles is living in poverty, which is defined by the California Poverty Measure as an annual household income of less than $30,785 for a family of four. Many impoverished residents, despite working full-time, earn too little to cover bare necessities such as safe housing, healthy food, adequate clothing, and basic medical care. With each year, the cost of living in the County rises while real wages for the lowest income County residents stagnate or fail to keep pace.
The Board also finds that income inequality is a substantial economic and social issue facing the County. Low income workers often rely on the County as a provider of social support services. When employees do not receive a sufficient wage for their labor, the community and taxpayers bear associated costs in the form of increased demand for taxpayer-funded services, including emergency medical services, homeless shelters, and other social services and community-based services. Therefore, the County has an interest in promoting an employment environment in unincorporated areas that protects government resources while promoting the health, safety, and welfare of workers by ensuring they receive a reasonable wage for the work they perform.

Chapter 8.101 - WAGE ENFORCEMENT

8.101.010 - Short Title.
The ordinance codified in this Chapter shall be known as the "Los Angeles County Wage Enforcement Ordinance."
(Ord. 2016-0026 § 2, 2016.)
8.101.020 - Findings and Purpose.
The Board of Supervisors finds and declares as follows:
A.
Findings. Wage theft occurs when employees are not paid the wages they are owed by their employers. This can occur when workers receive payment at a rate below the legal hourly minimum wage, whether paid by the hour, by the piece, by the week, or by the project. Significant and extensive minimum wage violations have been documented throughout California, as well as within the County of Los Angeles. The Economic Roundtable and the University of California Los Angeles indicate that violations of wage laws in Los Angeles County are pervasive, with 30 percent of low wage workers in Los Angeles County receiving less than the minimum wage and 88.5 percent of workers experiencing some sort of wage theft.
A practice of not fully paying employees also gives unscrupulous employers a competitive business advantage that harms responsible employers. In addition, workers that are not paid the full amount they earn are often forced to resort to government services to provide for their and their families' basic needs, thereby drawing on already limited resources of the County.
On November 17, 2015, the County adopted the Los Angeles County Minimum Wage Ordinance establishing a new minimum wage in the unincorporated areas of the County which becomes effective on July 1, 2016, and increases in various increments thereafter. The Los Angeles County Minimum Wage Ordinance promotes an employment environment that helps protect government resources while promoting the health, safety and welfare of the County's residents.
Therefore, the County has an interest in: (1) enforcing wage violations to promote the health, safety, and welfare of workers, their families, and communities; (2) protecting government resources, by ensuring employees receive the wages they earn, thereby diminishing the need for government assistance; and (3) providing assistance to businesses to help with and encourage compliance.
It is also necessary and important that the County and any department responsible for enforcing wage violations, or any other activities that may be necessary to assist the County in enforcing wage violations, be able to obtain the information needed in order to complete a thorough investigation by legal means, including but not limited to, the subpoena process.
B.
Purpose. The purpose of the Los Angeles County Wage Enforcement Ordinance is to: (1) create a wage enforcement program that ensures employees performing work in the unincorporated areas of the County of Los Angeles are paid no less than the amount they are owed according to the Los Angeles County Minimum Wage Ordinance; (2) educate and inform County employers and employees about the requirements, benefits, and protections provided by the County of Los Angeles and its wage enforcement program; (3) refer violations of wage and hour laws that are the responsibility of other enforcement agencies, such as misclassification of independent contractors, to the appropriate authority for investigation; and (4) allow for partnerships between the County and other local, State, and federal agencies responsible for enforcement of wage and hour laws throughout the County to promote a fair employment environment for all employees and businesses.

The amount of the additional late fee shall be ten percent of the total amount of the administrative fine assessed for each month the amounts are unpaid, compounded to include already accrued late administrative fines that remain unpaid. The County may exercise its discretion regarding the fines, penalties, and fees levied based on the severity of the violation, the length of the violation, and whether the violation was the first of its kind for the Employer.
D.
Collections of Amounts Due. The failure of any Employer to pay amounts owed to the County under this Chapter when due shall constitute a debt to the County. The County may file a civil action or, to the extent feasible under State law, create and impose a lien against any property owned or operated by an Employer or other person who fails to pay an administrative fine assessed by the DCBA, or pursue any other legal remedy to collect such money.
E.
Successor Liability. If any Employer ceases its business operations, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the Employer's business or stock of goods, then any person who becomes a successor to the business shall become liable for the unpaid amount of the remedies defined in the Wage Enforcement Order if, at the time of the conveyance of the business, the successor has actual knowledge of the fact and amount of the Wage Enforcement Order.
F.
Payments to Employees; Fines and Restitution. Every Employer who violates the Los Angeles County Minimum Wage Ordinance, or any portion thereof, shall be liable to the Employee whose rights were violated for back wages unlawfully withheld and a fine of $100 for each day that the violation occurred or continued. A violation for unlawfully withholding wages shall be deemed to continue from the date immediately following the date that the wages were due and payable as provided in Part 1 (commencing with section 200) of Chapter 2 of the California Labor Code, to the date immediately preceding the date the wages are paid in full. For retaliatory action by the Employer, the Employee shall be entitled to reinstatement of his or her prior position, assignment, or job, if applicable, and a trebling of all back wages, fines, and penalties.
G.
Interest. In any administrative or civil action brought for the nonpayment of wages under this Chapter, the DCBA or the court, shall award interest on all due and unpaid wages, fines, and penalties at the rate of interest specified in subdivision (b) of section 3289 of the California Civil Code, which shall accrue from the date the wages were due and payable as provided in Part 1 (commencing with section 200) of Division 2 of the California Labor Code, to the date immediately preceding the date the wages are paid in full.
(Ord. 2016-0026 § 2, 2016.)
8.101.160 - Additional Penalties.
A.
County Contracts, Disqualification or Termination. The DCBA shall provide notice to all County departments of Employers that are subject to a final Wage Enforcement Order, Reconsideration Determination, or Hearing Officer's decision that finds the Employer violated a County wage ordinance. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Employers determined to be in violation of a County wage ordinance may be subject to penalties affecting their current or potential contractual relationships with the County. Penalties shall be set forth in the Director's Rules and may include, but are not limited to, disqualification from contracting with the County and termination of existing contracts.
B.
County Licenses. The Director may recommend that any license issued by the County or any departments thereof, or the application for, or renewal or transfer of, a license of an Employer determined to be in violation of this Chapter be suspended, revoked, or denied. In evaluating whether a license should be recommended for suspension, revocation, or denial, the Director may take into consideration factors including, but not limited to: (1) whether the Employer's violation was an inadvertent or clerical error; (2) whether the violation was the first violation by that Employer; (3) whether any violation was corrected timely; and (4) whether any amounts due to Employees or the County as a result of the violation were timely paid. The decision to suspend, revoke, or deny a license based on a recommendation from the Director shall be made by the department issuing the license and done in accordance with applicable law.
(Ord. 2016-0026 § 2, 2016.)
8.101.170 - Other Remedies Not Affected.
A.
The remedies, fines, penalties, and procedures provided under this Chapter are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other available remedies, fines, penalties, and procedures. By filing a claim with the County, an employee is not precluded from being able to recover remedies available to them under any other code, regulation, or law. The procedures established in this Chapter shall be in addition to any other criminal, civil, or other remedy established by law which may be pursued to address violations of this Chapter. An administrative citation issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not prejudice or adversely affect any other action, civil or criminal, that may be brought to prosecute or abate a violation or to seek compensation for damages suffered.
B.
Any Employee aggrieved by a violation of Chapter 8.100 or this Chapter, the County, or any other person or entity acting on behalf of the public as provided for under applicable State law, may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the Employer violating Chapter 8.100 or this Chapter and, upon prevailing, shall be entitled to such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation including, without limitation, the payment of any back wages unlawfully withheld, the payment of fines in the amount of $100 to each Employee whose rights under Chapter 8.100 or this Chapter were violated for each day that the violation occurred or continued, reinstatement in employment and/or injunctive relief, and shall be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Any person or entity enforcing Chapter 8.100 or this Chapter on behalf of the public as provided for under applicable State law, upon prevailing, shall be entitled only to equitable, injunctive or restitutionary relief, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Nothing in this Chapter shall be interpreted as restricting, precluding, or otherwise limiting a separate or concurrent criminal prosecution under the Los Angeles County Code or State law. Jeopardy shall not attach as a result of any administrative or civil enforcement action taken pursuant to this Chapter.
(Ord. 2016-0026 § 2, 2016.)
8.101.180 - Authority; Severability; Effective Date.

Appendix A - RENT STABILIZATION REGULATIONS
Parts:
Part 1 - CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
RENT ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
(August 6, 1979)
I.
Definitions.
1.
A capital improvement as defined in Ordinance 11950 is: "The addition or replacement of the following improvements to a rental unit or common areas of the housing complex containing the rental unit, provided such new improvement has a useful life of five years or more: roofing, carpeting, draperies, stuccoing the outside of a building, air conditioning, security gates, swimming pool, sauna or hot tub, fencing, garbage disposal, washing machine or clothes dryer (coin-operated are not eligible, see II. Eligibility No. 3), dishwasher, children's play equipment permanently installed on the premises, and other similar improvements as determined by the Regional Planning Department."
2.
Additional similar items not listed in Ordinance 11950 may be allowable capital improvements when they conform to the following principles:
(a)
The improvement must primarily benefit the tenant rather than the landlord. For example, the remodeling of the lobby would be eligible as a capital improvement, while the construction of a sign advertising the rental complex would not be eligible.
(b)
The improvement must have a life expectancy of five years or more.
(c)
Equipment eligible as costs for which a capital improvement rent increase can be made must be permanently fixed in place or relatively immobile (e.g., sinks, bathtubs, stoves, refrigerators, kitchen cabinets are items eligible as capital improvement).
(d)
Normal routine maintenance and repair of the rental unit and the building is not capital improvement while replacement of old screens with new screens would be a capital improvement.
(e)
In the case of painting, the complete painting of the complete exterior of the building and/or the painting of the common interior area (interior walls and corridors) are eligible as a capital improvement. The repainting of an individual apartment is considered normal maintenance.
(f)
In establishing the cost of a capital improvement, the landlord must be able to prove the actual value through adequate and reliable documentation. The landlord may transfer the landlord's personal appliances, furniture, etc., or those inherited or borrowed from friends. However, the fair market value must be established in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.
II.
Eligibility.
1.
Only capital improvements completed on or after April 1, 1978 are eligible for a capital improvement rent increase.
2.
The eligibility of any particular improvement included in the landlord's application for a rent increase based on capital improvements will be determined by the Rent Adjustment Panel.
3.
Capital improvements otherwise eligible for a rent increase are not eligible if the landlord charges a "use fee." An example of this would be a landlord-owned washer and dryer in a common area where the tenants must deposit coins to use the equipment. Since the equipment will be paid for by this fee system, the landlord may not include such a request for a rent raise based on capital improvements.
4.
Ordinance 11950 does not require any approval by tenants or the Rent Adjustment Commission prior to the landlord making a capital improvement.
III.
Determination of extraordinary rent increase
1.
Capital improvement costs must be circulated on the basis of actual cost. Cancelled checks, receipts, invoices, social security payments, and W-2 forms are among the types of evidence that will be required to substantiate such costs.
2.
Labor provided by the landlord, the landlord's family, the landlord's agent or agent's family, may be billed at a reasonable cost as a part of any capital improvement, unless said persons are employees of the landlord, whose costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
3.
Labor costs of a manager, maintenance men, or other employees of the landlord may be included as a part of the capital improvement cost unless said costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
4.
Interest on money borrowed to pay for capital improvements work shall be included as a part of the capital improvement cost. In those cases where the landlord finances the capital improvement costs or a part thereof with his own funds, interest at the legal rate of interest set forth in Civil Code Section 1916-1 (at 7 percent as of July 1, 1979), valued over a reasonable amount of time, shall be included as a part of the capital improvement cost. The landlord shall have the burden of proof in establishing the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed. In determining the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed, the Rent Adjustment Panel shall be principally guided by the current practices of state and federally chartered banks and savings and loan associations.
5.
In the event a landlord receives net compensation for any portion of the money spent on capital improvements (insurance, court-awarded damages, federal or state subsidies, etc.), this compensation must be deducted from the cost of the capital improvements before amortizing the costs among the units.
6.
In the event that the net compensation described in No. 5 above is received after the landlord receives approval for an extraordinary rent increase, but within the life of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, the landlord shall immediately reduce rents prospectively on a per-unit basis by amortizing said net compensation over a 60-month period.
7.
In determining the Average Per Unit Capital Improvement Cost, the cost of the capital improvement shall be divided by the number of units affected by the improvement, irrespective of whether all of such units are subject to Ordinance 11950.
Part 2 - REHABILITATION
RENT ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO REHABILITATION WORK
(August 6, 1979)
I.
Definition. ..... Rehabilitation or repair work done on or in a rental unit or common areas of the housing complex containing the rental unit and which work was done in order to comply with an order issued by the County Engineer, the Public Health or the Fire Departments, or to repair damage resulting from fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster.
(Ord. 2006-0040 § 35 (part), 2006.)
II.
Eligibility requirements.
1.
Only rehabilitation work completed on or after April 1, 1978, is eligible for an extraordinary rent increase.
2.
Any portion of the rehabilitation work completed before April 1, 1978, is ineligible for a rent increase under this category unless the landlord can prove that the work completed before April 1st was intrinsically connected with rehabilitation work that was completed on or after April 1st. (For example: if the plastering of a wall was finished on March 25th but the painter did not paint the wall until April 2nd, both the plasterer's and painter's costs would be eligible. However, if roof repairs were completed on March 29th but a new vented heater wasn't installed until April 3rd, the heater would be eligible but the roof repair would not.)
3.
Any work performed, not mandated by the order of the County Engineer, the County Public Health Department, or the County Fire Department, or not connected with the repair of damage resulting from fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster, is ineligible under this category although it might be eligible under Capital Improvement Rent Increases. See the Capital Improvement Guidelines for further information.
(Ord. 2006-0040 § 35 (part), 2006.)
III.
Determination of extraordinary rent increase.
1.
Rehabilitation costs must be calculated on the basis of actual cost. Cancelled checks, receipts, invoices, social security payments and W-2 forms are among the types of evidence that will be required to substantiate such costs.
2.
Labor provided by the landlord, the landlord's family, the landlord's agent or agent's family, may be billed at a reasonable cost as part of any rehabilitation work, unless said persons are employees of the landlord, whose costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
3.
Labor costs of a manager, maintenance men or other employees of the landlord may be included as a part of the rehabilitation work cost unless said costs have previously been taken into account in establishing the existing rents.
4.
Interest on money borrowed to pay for rehabilitation work shall be included as a part of the rehabilitation work cost. In those cases where the landlord finances the rehabilitation work costs or a part thereof with his own funds, interest at the legal rate of interest set forth in Civil Code Section 1916-1 (at 7 percent as of July 1, 1979), valued over a reasonable amount of time, shall be included as a part of the rehabilitation work cost. The landlord shall have the burden of proof in establishing the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed. In determining the reasonable amount of time over which interest shall be allowed, the Rent Adjustment Panel shall be principally guided by the current practices of state and federally chartered banks and savings and loan associations.
5.
In the event a landlord receives net compensation for any portion of the money spent on rehabilitation work (insurance, court awarded damages, federal or state subsidies, etc.), this compensation must be deducted from the cost of the rehabilitation work before amortizing the costs among the units.
6.
In the event that the net compensation described in No. 5 above is received after the landlord receives approval for an extraordinary rent increase, but within the life of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, the landlord shall immediately reduce rents prospectively on a per-unit basis by amortizing said net compensation over a 60-month period.
7.
In determining the Average Per Unit Rehabilitation Cost, the cost of the rehabilitation work shall be divided by the number of units affected by the work, irrespective of whether all of such units are subject to Ordinance 11950.
Part 3 - REASONABLE RETURN
RENT ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVIDE FOR A JUST AND REASONABLE RETURN
(August 6, 1979)
1.
The Rent Regulation Ordinance contains a number of provisions assuring a just and reasonable return on rental units subject to the Ordinance. These provisions include:
(a)
Automatic increases over the applicable base rent (Section 8.52.040);
(b)
Automatic rent increases to permit the pass through of an increase in the cost of gas, water, sewer charges, and/or electricity;
(c)
Vacancy decontrol;
(d)
Exemption of luxury units;
(e)
Pass through of capital improvement costs;
(f)
Pass through of rehabilitation work costs.
2.
In most cases, the automatic increases allowed by Ordinance 11950 and the property tax savings resulting from Proposition 13 provide sufficient additional operating income to property owners to maintain an adequate return on their units. However, in some cases, the limitations imposed on property owners by the Rent Regulation Ordinance may prevent such owners from realizing a just and reasonable return. In those cases, the owner may qualify for an extraordinary rent increase pursuant to the guidelines set forth herein.
3.
The following factors may be considered in determining whether a rental unit yields a just and reasonable return:
(a)
Property taxes;
(b)
Reasonable operating and maintenance expenses;
(c)
Debt service expenses (principal and interest);
(d)
The extent to which expenses may be reimbursed;
(e)
The extent of capital improvements made to the building in which a rental unit is located as distinguished from ordinary repair, replacement, and maintenance.
4.
With respect to debt service, such expenses (principal and interest) shall be recognized only to the extent that the level of debt and the terms of financing are reasonable and consistent with current practices of state and federally chartered banks and savings and loan associations.
5.
To the extent that the maximum rents permitted by Ordinance 11950 do not allow the landlord return sufficient to pay both operating expenses and debt service, a rent adjustment may be allowed to the extent necessary to eliminate a negative cash flow, provided all expenses and debt service are reasonable and consistent with the Ordinance and this guideline.
6.
In determining whether a rental unit yields a just and reasonable return, the income and expenses of all portions of the building used for residential purposes and common areas shall be considered, irrespective of whether all of such building and common areas are subject to the Ordinance. In those instances where another business is conducted on the premises, only that income and expense connected with the rental units shall be considered. For example, if there is a restaurant operating on the premises and 10 percent of the total maintenance effort is associated with operating the restaurant, 10 percent of the maintenance expense shall be excluded from the calculations. In those cases where the landlord's accounting methods do not allocate expenses among the separate businesses, the landlord may submit such expenses based upon a good faith estimate.
7.
Expense data submitted may be subject to comparisons with industry-wide standards in determining the reasonableness of operating expenses.
8.
As to properties acquired by the landlord after July 1, 1979, no extraordinary rent increase will be permitted if the only justification offered on the landlord's application is an assertion that the maximum rents permitted by the Ordinance do not allow the landlord return sufficient to pay both operating expenses and debt service.
