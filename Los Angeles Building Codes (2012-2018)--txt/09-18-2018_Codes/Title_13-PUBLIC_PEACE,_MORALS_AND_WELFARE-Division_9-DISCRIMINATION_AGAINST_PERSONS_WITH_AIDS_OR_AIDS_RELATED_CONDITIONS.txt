Division 9 - DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PERSONS WITH AIDS OR AIDS RELATED CONDITIONS
Chapter 13.70 - PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES

13.70.010 - Findings.
The board of supervisors of the county of Los Angeles finds that discrimination or the fear of discrimination against persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or conditions related to AIDS, and against persons believed to have AIDS or conditions related to AIDS, discourages persons from seeking medical treatment, counseling, education, and other services related to this condition. In order to encourage persons to fully utilize such services so that this condition can be diagnosed and treated and the risk of transmission to others can be reduced, it is necessary that discrimination against persons with AIDS or AIDS related conditions be clearly prohibited.
