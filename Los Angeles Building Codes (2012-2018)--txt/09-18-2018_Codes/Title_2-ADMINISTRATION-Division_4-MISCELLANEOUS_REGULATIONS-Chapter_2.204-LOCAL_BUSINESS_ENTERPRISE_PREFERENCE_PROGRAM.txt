Chapter 2.204 - LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PREFERENCE PROGRAM

2.204.010 - Introduction.
The Board of Supervisors finds that it is of benefit to the County of Los Angeles to promote and facilitate the fullest possible participation by all citizens in the affairs of the County in every way possible. It is also essential that opportunities be provided for full participation in our free enterprise system by small business enterprises. Further, it is the policy of the Board that the County should aid and assist, to the maximum extent possible, the interests of local small business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise and to ensure that a fair proportion of County concession contracts, and the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for purchase of goods or services for the County be placed with such enterprises.

2.204.020 - Purpose.
The County of Los Angeles Local Small Business Enterprise Preference Program is a race and gender-neutral program designed to enhance purchasing and contracting opportunities for local small businesses within the County of Los Angeles. The program priorities were developed to promote and foster inclusiveness and economic development, as well as ongoing evaluation to assure all businesses, including local small businesses, are provided equal opportunities in County concession, purchasing, and contracting activities.
