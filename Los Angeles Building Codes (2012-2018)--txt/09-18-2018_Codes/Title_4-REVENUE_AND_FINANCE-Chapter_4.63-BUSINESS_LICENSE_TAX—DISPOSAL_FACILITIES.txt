4.63.150 - Assessment—Administrative remedy.

1. Whenever the tax administrator determines that any tax is due or may be due to the county under the provisions of this chapter, he may make and give notice of an assessment of such tax.
2.
The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of any tax known by the tax administrator to be due or estimated by the tax administrator, after full consideration of all information within his knowledge concerning the business and activities of the operator assessed, to be due under each applicable section of this chapter and shall include the amount of any penalties or interest accrued on each amount to the date of notice of assessment.

The notice of assessment shall be served upon the operator either by handing it to him personally, or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the operator at the address of the location of the business appearing on the face of the registration certificate issued to him or to such other address as he shall register with the tax administrator for the purpose of receiving notices provided under this chapter; should the operator have no registration certificate issued to him and should he have no address registered with the tax administrator for such purpose, then to such operator's last known address. For the purpose of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail. Within 15 days after the date of service, the operator assessed may either apply in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the assessment or may file a written request that such hearing be waived. If the operator neither requests a hearing upon the assessment nor requests a waiver of hearing within the prescribed time, the amount of the assessment shall be final and the amount thereof shall immediately be due and owing to the county, but penalties and interest as provided by this chapter shall continue to accrue until paid.
C.
If the operator requests that the hearing be waived, the tax administrator may either grant such request and notify the operator thereof in writing or may, in his discretion, deny the request and set the assessment for hearing at the time and in the manner prescribed by subsection D hereof. If the tax administrator grants the request for waiver of hearing, the administrative proceedings prescribed by this section shall be deemed exhausted and the county shall have the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount of the assessment, plus such penalties and interest as may have accrued thereon as provided by this chapter.
D.
If an application for hearing is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed in this chapter to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in subsection E hereof.
E.
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of the tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the board by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the board within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. Upon the filing of a notice of appeal, the board shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and the clerk of the board shall give not less than five days' notice in writing, either personally or by United States mail, postage prepaid.
F.
Appointment of Referee. The board may appoint a referee to take testimony at any hearing provided for in subsection E of this chapter, and to report his findings and recommendations to the board. Neither the tax administrator nor any officer or employee in the office of the tax administrator may be appointed referee.
G.

Conduct at Appeal Hearing. At the time set for the hearing, or at the date to which the hearing may be continued by the board or referee, the board or referee shall hear the appellant and any other competent witnesses and decide whether the determination of the tax administrator was correct or not, and if not what tax, interest or penalties, if any, are due to the county from the appellant. The referee may place any witnesses, including the appellant, under oath.

Final Determination at Appeal Hearing. The board shall determine from the evidence or from the report of the referee, what tax, interest or penalties, if any, are due to the county from the appellant.

Any amount due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of the said notice.
