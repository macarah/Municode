Part 5 - ENFORCEMENT

11.37.150 - Public Health Permit Suspension and Revocation.
A.
Any cannabis facility public health permit issued to a permittee may be suspended or revoked by the Department for a violation of the requirements of this Chapter or Part 7 of Chapter 8.04, or State and local laws or regulations. Any cannabis facility, or portion of a microbusiness, for which the public health permit has been suspended or revoked shall close and cease doing business and remain closed until the permit has been reinstated or reissued by the Department.
B.
Whenever the Department finds that a cannabis facility is not in compliance with the requirements of this Chapter or State and local laws or regulations, a written notice of violation that contains a required compliance date shall be issued to the permittee. If the permittee fails to correct the violation within the specified time, the Department shall issue to the permittee a written notice setting forth the permit violations found by the Department. The notice shall inform the permittee of a right to a compliance review, if requested, to show cause why the permittee's public health permit should not be suspended or revoked. A permittee must make a written request to the Department for a compliance review within 10 calendar days of service of the notice, or correct the violation. A failure to request a compliance review within 10 calendar days after service of the notice shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a compliance review, and may subject the permittee's permit to immediate suspension by the Department.
C.
The compliance review shall be held within 15 calendar days of the Department's receipt of the permittee's written request for a compliance review. Upon written request by the permittee, the compliance review officer may postpone any compliance review date, if circumstances warrant such action, or cancel the compliance review if the permittee's violations are corrected as verified by the Department.
D.
At the compliance review, the Department's compliance review officer shall hear testimony and read and consider document submissions from the permittee and Department representatives.
E.
The compliance review officer shall issue and serve a written decision to the permittee within 15 working days following the compliance review. In the event of suspension or revocation, the decision shall specify the permit violations that were found to exist and/or continue, the extent of the suspension of the permit, and the actions required for correction of the continuing violations. If the permittee's public health permit has been revoked, the decisions shall state the reasons for the revocation.
F.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, if any immediate danger to the public health or safety is found or is reasonably suspected, unless the danger is immediately corrected, the Department may immediately suspend the permittee's public health permit and order the cannabis facility immediately closed, pending the determination of a compliance review. Immediate danger to the public health or safety shall include any condition, based upon inspection findings or other evidence, that can cause, or is reasonably suspected of causing, infection, illness or disease transmission, or any known or reasonably suspected hazardous condition.
1.
Whenever a public health permit is suspended as the result of an immediate danger to the public health or safety, the Department shall issue to the permittee a notice setting forth the violations that have caused the immediate danger, specifying the sections of this Chapter or State and local laws or regulations, allegedly violated, and informing the permittee of the right to a compliance review.
2.
At any time within 10 calendar days of service of a notice pursuant to subsection G, the permittee may request, in writing, a compliance review before a compliance review officer to show cause why the public health permit suspension is not warranted. The compliance review shall be held within 15 calendar days of the receipt of a request for a compliance review. A failure to request a compliance review within 10 calendar days shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such compliance review.
H.
The Department may, after providing opportunity for a compliance review, modify, suspend, or revoke a public health permit for serious or repeated violations of the requirements of this Chapter or State and local laws and regulations, or for interference in the performance of the inspection and investigations duties of the Department.
I.
A public health permit may be reinstated, or a new public health permit issued, if the Department determines that conditions which prompted the suspension or revocation no longer exist.
