Chapter 20.90 - GARBAGE DISPOSAL DISTRICTS
Parts:
Part 1 - ATHENS-WOODCREST-OLIVITA GARBAGE DISPOSAL DISTRICT

20.90.010 - Title for citation.
The ordinance codified in Part 1 of Chapter 20.90 shall be known as the "garbage collection and disposal service fee ordinance" of the Athens-Woodcrest-Olivita Garbage Disposal District and may be cited as such.
(Ord. 12217 Art. 1 § 101, 1980.)
20.90.020 - Purpose of provisions—Basis for service fee.
The District is responsible for providing garbage collection and disposal within its boundaries. The amount of money from ad valorem taxes available to the District is inadequate to fund the cost of service. The District's collection and disposal service must be continued without interruption in order to protect the public health and safety of the residents therein and the general public. It is, therefore, necessary to impose a garbage collection and disposal service fee upon the properties within the District. The voters of the District have approved imposition of the fee. In order to avoid the substantial costs of establishing a billing system for the collection of fees, the board of supervisors finds that the fees should be collected on the tax roll. Due to the legal deadlines for such tax collection, it is necessary for the ordinance codified in this part to be effective by September 25, 1980. Since the District's services are required for the collection and disposal of garbage, the board of supervisors finds that the most equitable basis upon which to base the service fee will be according to the current property use classification derived from the assessor's tax rolls.

Part 13 - WALNUT PARK GARBAGE DISPOSAL DISTRICT

20.90.600 - Title for citation.
The ordinance codified in Part 13 of Chapter 20.90 shall be known as the "garbage collection and disposal service fee ordinance" of the Walnut Park Garbage Disposal District, and may be cited as such.
(Ord. 12223 Art. 1 § 101, 1980.)
20.90.610 - Purpose of provisions—Basis for service fee.
The District is responsible for providing garbage collection and disposal within its boundaries. The amount of money from ad valorem taxes available to the District is inadequate to fund the cost of service. The District's collection and disposal service must be continued without interruption in order to protect the public health and safety of the residents therein and the general public. It is, therefore, necessary to impose a garbage collection and disposal service fee upon the properties within the District. The voters of the District have approved imposition of the fee. In order to avoid the substantial costs of establishing a billing system for the collection of fees, the board of supervisors finds that the fees should be collected on the tax roll. Due to the legal deadlines for such tax collection, it is necessary for the ordinance codified in this part to be effective by September 25, 1980. Since the District's services are required for the collection and disposal of garbage, the board of supervisors finds that the most equitable basis upon which to base the service fee will be according to the current property use classification derived from the assessor's tax rolls.
(Ord. 12223 Art. 1 § 102, 1980.)
20.90.620 - Definitions.
A.
"District" means the Walnut Park Garbage Disposal District.
B.
"Board" means the board of supervisors of the county of Los Angeles.
C.
"Parcel of real property" means a parcel of real property as shown on the local secured tax rolls of the county of Los Angeles.
(Ord. 12223 Art. 2 §§ 201, 202, 203, 1980.)
20.90.630 - Service fees.
A.
An annual garbage collection and disposal service fee is levied upon parcels of real property in the District for the services provided by the District.
B.
The amount of the fee for each parcel shall be computed by multiplying the refuse unit fee by the number of refuse units assigned to the property use classification of the parcel as shown in Table 1, codified in Section 20.90.650. The refuse unit fee is $215.00 per unit, beginning with the 2005-06 fiscal year.
C.
This fee shall be in addition to any ad valorem taxes levied on such property. The current property use classification and the refuse units assigned to each property use are as set forth in Table 1.
(Ord. 2005-0039 § 1, 2005: Ord. 95-0031 § 1, 1995: Ord. 94-0035 § 1, 1994: Ord. 91-0084 § 4, 1991; Ord. 90-0092 § 5, 1990; Ord. 88-0104 § 4, 1988; Ord. 85-0117U § 6, 1985; Ord. 84-0103 § 17, 1984; Ord. 83-0148U § 13, 1983; Ord. 82-0181 § 13, 1982: Ord. 12403 § 1, 1982: Ord. 12223 Art. 3 § 301, 1980.)
