For the purposes of calculating Plan benefits, the Plan Administrator may rely on calculations and determinations made by LACERA for purposes of administering the Retirement Plan in accordance with Section 415(b).

B.
At the Plan Administrator's discretion, the amount of every Participant's and Eligible Survivor's benefits may be redetermined at any time there is a material change in the rules governing the maximum benefit limits established under Section 415(b) or a material change in Retirement Plan benefits.
C.
If Retirement Plan benefits have ceased in accordance with Section 5.95.080 and then recommence in accordance with Section 5.95.090, a recalculation shall be made under this Section 5.95.130 as soon as administratively practicable after Retirement Plan benefits resume.

The provisions of Section 5.95.220 will apply in the case of any property settlement upon marital dissolution or legal separation which is made in accordance with a domestic relations order that is not qualified in accordance with this Section.

In addition, in order for a DRO to be recognized as "qualified," the parties seeking to enforce the DRO must have properly notified and joined the Plan under applicable state law.
Consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)-13(g)(4)(iv), under which the total benefits payable to both the Participant and alternate payee from the Retirement Plan are considered benefits of the Participant for the purposes of applying the limitations of IRC section 415, the total benefit payable to the alternate payee and the Participant under this Plan shall not exceed the total benefit that otherwise would be payable to the Participant alone as determined under Part 4.
The Plan Administrator shall establish administrative policies and procedures consistent with this Section for determining whether any judgment, order, or decree constitutes a qualified DRO.
