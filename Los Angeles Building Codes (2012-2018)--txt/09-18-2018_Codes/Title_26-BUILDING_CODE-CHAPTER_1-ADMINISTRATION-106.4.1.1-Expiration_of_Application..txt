106.4.1.1 - Expiration of Application.
When no permit is issued within one year following the date of the application therefor, the application shall automatically expire. Plans and specifications previously submitted may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Building Official. The Building Official may grant up to two extensions not exceeding 180 days per extension, beyond the initial one-year limit upon written request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken and upon the payment of an extension fee as determined by the Building Official, not to exceed 25 percent of the plan check fee.
Once an application, including any extension(s) thereof has expired, the applicant shall file a new application, resubmit plans and specifications and pay a new plan checking or review fee.
