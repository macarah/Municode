At least 50 percent, determined by weight, of all project C&D debris, exclusive of soil, rock, and gravel, must be recycled or reused unless a lower percentage is approved by the director upon a determination that recycling or reuse of 50 percent of all such materials is not reasonably feasible.
C.
Inert materials, exclusive of soil, rock, and gravel, may comprise no more than two-thirds, determined by weight, of the percentage of project C&D debris that is required to be recycled or reused under subsection B, unless a higher percentage of inert materials is approved by the director upon a determination that the project will not otherwise generate or result in sufficient C&D debris to meet the level of recycling or reuse required in subsection B.
D.
In the event the required percentages of C&D debris have not been recycled or reused, every ton or fraction of a ton of C&D debris that has not been recycled or reused as required constitutes a separate violation of this chapter for which the director may impose administrative penalties as provided by subsection G of Section 20.87.090.
E.
Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit or discourage recycling or reuse of more than the required percentage of any project C&D debris.
