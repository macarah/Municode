20.87.040 - Recycling and reuse requirements.
A.
At least 50 percent, determined by weight, of all soil, rock, and gravel removed from a project site must be recycled or reused unless a lower percentage is approved by the director upon a determination that recycling or reuse of 50 percent of all such materials is not reasonably feasible. To the extent practicable, soil, rock, and gravel to be removed from the project site may not be commingled with other project C&D debris.

At least 50 percent, determined by weight, of all project C&D debris, exclusive of soil, rock, and gravel, must be recycled or reused unless a lower percentage is approved by the director upon a determination that recycling or reuse of 50 percent of all such materials is not reasonably feasible.
C.
Inert materials, exclusive of soil, rock, and gravel, may comprise no more than two-thirds, determined by weight, of the percentage of project C&D debris that is required to be recycled or reused under subsection B, unless a higher percentage of inert materials is approved by the director upon a determination that the project will not otherwise generate or result in sufficient C&D debris to meet the level of recycling or reuse required in subsection B.
D.
In the event the required percentages of C&D debris have not been recycled or reused, every ton or fraction of a ton of C&D debris that has not been recycled or reused as required constitutes a separate violation of this chapter for which the director may impose administrative penalties as provided by subsection G of Section 20.87.090.
E.
Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit or discourage recycling or reuse of more than the required percentage of any project C&D debris.
(Ord. 2005-0004 § 1 (part), 2005.)
20.87.050 - Submission and required contents of recycling and reuse plan.
A.
An RRP must be submitted to the department of public works, environmental programs division, after an application for a permit has been filed for a project, unless an RRP for the project is already on file with the department of public works.

An RRP must contain all of the following information:
1.
The name and address of the person applying for the permit;
2.
Unless waived by the director, evidence that the owner or owners of the subject property acknowledge that they are aware of and understand that a violation of any provision of this chapter may result in the imposition of administrative penalties and that any unpaid administrative penalties imposed may be declared a lien on the subject property;
3.
A description of the project, including location, scope, required permit(s), and estimated timeline for completion of the project;
4.
The estimated total weight of the project C&D debris, with separate estimates for (1) soil, rock, and gravel; (2) all other inert materials; and (3) all other project C&D debris;

The names and addresses of all vendors and facilities proposed to be used to collect, receive, dispose, recycle, or reuse the project C&D debris;
7.
The recycling or reuse rate, as applicable, of each vendor and facility proposed to be used to recycle or reuse the project C&D debris; and
8.
The estimated percentage, determined by weight, of the project C&D debris that will be recycled or reused, with separate estimates for: (1) soil, rock, and gravel; (2) all other inert materials; and (3) all other project C&D debris.
(Ord. 2005-0004 § 1 (part), 2005.)
20.87.060 - Approval of recycling and reuse plan.
A.
No permit will be issued for a project unless and until the director has reviewed and approved an RRP for the project. An RRP will be approved only if the director determines that:
1.
The RRP contains all of the information required by Section 20.87.050; and
2.
The RRP demonstrates compliance with the requirements of Section 20.87.040. If approved by the director, the recycling or reuse rate of a vendor or facility employed in the recycling or reuse of project C&D debris may be used to substantiate the amount of project C&D debris recycled or reused by that vendor or facility.
B.
If at any time it becomes apparent that the contents of an approved RRP are no longer accurate, the director must be notified immediately to determine whether an addendum to the RRP must be submitted.
C.
In the event an addendum to an RRP is required, the addendum must be submitted with such information as may be required by the director to ensure compliance with subsection B of Section 20.87.050.
(Ord. 2005-0004 § 1 (part), 2005.)
20.87.070 - Evidence of compliance with recycling and reuse requirements.
A.
No later than 90 days after issuance of the first permit for the project, an initial progress report must be submitted to the director.

B.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an annual progress report is not required if the director has been notified that a final compliance report will be submitted on or before May 30 of the same year. In the event that no final compliance report is submitted by May 30, a progress report must be submitted no later than May 30.
C.
Within 45 days following project completion, a final compliance report containing the following information and documentation must be submitted to the director, with separate weights and calculations shown for (1) soil, rock, and gravel; (2) all other inert materials; and (3) all other project C&D debris:
1.
The weight of all project C&D debris;

All project C&D debris must be weighed on scales that comply with all applicable state and county regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance, except when the director determines that weighing C&D debris is not practical. In that event, a volumetric measurement must be used and the volume converted to weight based on the standardized conversion rate table approved by the director for this purpose.
(Ord. 2005-0004 § 1 (part), 2005.)
20.87.090 - Notice of violation and administrative penalty.
A.
In addition to any other remedy authorized by this code or applicable law, any violation of the provisions of this chapter will be subject to an administrative penalty, enforcement, and collection proceedings, as set forth in this chapter and authorized by section 53069.4 of the California Government Code. Each day of a continuing violation constitutes a separate violation.
B.
Except as otherwise provided in subsection C, the director may impose an administrative penalty for each violation in an amount not to exceed $100 for the first violation, $200 for the second violation of the same provision of this chapter within one year after the first violation, and $500 for each additional violation of the same provision of this chapter within one year after the first violation. Where a violation constitutes a continuing violation, no administrative penalty will be imposed unless the violation is not corrected within 30 days of the date of service of a notice describing the violation. Upon a determination by the director that a continuing violation cannot be subsequently corrected or cured, the violation will be deemed corrected at the end of 60 days following the date of service of the notice of violation.
C.
If the director determines that a project is in violation of the requirements of Section 20.87.040, the director may impose an administrative penalty equal to $250 for every ton or fraction of a ton of C&D debris that was not recycled or reused as required.
D.
Whenever the director determines that a violation of any provision of this chapter has occurred, the director is authorized to issue a notice of violation. The director's issuance of a notice of violation is final unless an administrative appeal has been filed as provided in Section 20.87.100. If such an administrative appeal is not filed, the director may withhold approval of any and all RRPs submitted by the responsible person on any project(s) until the applicable administrative penalty has been paid, and the amount of any unpaid administrative penalty may be declared a lien on any real property on which the project took place, as provided in Section 20.87.120.

The hearing officer shall sustain, rescind, or modify the notice of violation by written decision. The hearing officer shall have the power to waive any portion of an administrative penalty in a manner consistent with the decision. Service of the hearing officer's decision shall be made on the appellant in the manner provided in subsection C of Section 20.87.090. The decision of the hearing officer is final and effective on the date of service of the written decision, is not subject to further administrative review, and constitutes the final administrative decision. If judicial review of the final administrative decision is not sought in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.87.110, the decision of the hearing officer shall be deemed confirmed and the director may withhold approval of any and all RRPs submitted by the responsible person on any project(s) until the applicable administrative penalty has been paid, and the amount of any unpaid administrative penalty may be declared a lien on any real property on which the project took place, as provided in Section 20.87.120.
