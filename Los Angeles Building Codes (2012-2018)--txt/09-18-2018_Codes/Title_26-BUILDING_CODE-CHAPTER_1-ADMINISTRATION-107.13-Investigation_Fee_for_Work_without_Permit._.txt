Whenever any work has been commenced without a permit as required by the provisions of Section 106.1 of this Code, a special investigation shall be made prior to the issuance of the permit. An investigation fee shall be collected for each permit so investigated. The investigation fee shall be equal to and in addition to the permit fees specified in Sections 107.1, 107.5, and 107.7, but in no event shall the investigation fee be less than $364.60.
EXCEPTION: The investigation fee shall be $182.30 when the Building Official has determined that the owner-builder of a one- or two-family dwelling, accessory building or accessory structure had no knowledge that a permit was necessary and had not previously applied for a permit from the Building and Safety Division of the County of Los Angeles.
The payment of the investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this code nor from any penalty prescribed by law.
