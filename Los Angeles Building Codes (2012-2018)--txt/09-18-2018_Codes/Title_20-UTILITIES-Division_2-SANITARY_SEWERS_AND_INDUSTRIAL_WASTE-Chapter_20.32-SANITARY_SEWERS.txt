The County Engineer shall have the discretion to extend the expiration date of a sewer construction permit up to two (2) times, upon written request by the permittee submitted to the County Engineer prior to the date of expiration of the permit, demonstrating that the work for which the permit was issued was delayed because of inclement weather, strikes, acts of God, or other causes not within the control of the permittee. Each extension period shall be limited to a period of sixty (60) days from the date the permit is set to expire. The permittee must pay a non-refundable permit extension fee with each extension request in the amount equivalent to the issuance fee prescribed pursuant to Section 16.10.020 of this code, provided no changes have been made to the original application and plans for such work.

20.32.060 - Permit from other agencies required when.
Before granting any permit for the construction, installation, repair or removal of any sewer, or appurtenances thereto, which will necessitate any excavation or fill, in, upon or under any public street, highway or right-of-way under the jurisdiction of another public agency, the county engineer shall require the applicant to first obtain a permit from the agency having jurisdiction.
(Ord. 10020 § 3 (part), 1970: Ord. 8690 § 6 (part), 1964: Ord. 6130 Part 5 Ch. 1 § 5106, 1952.)

20.32.080 - Excessive discharge of sewage—Conditional permit requirements.
A.
Any person proposing to have sewage discharged from any property to a public sewer in quantities or at a rate greater than the capacity for which the sewer was designed, when proportioned to such property, and which such additional quantity will immediately overload the sewer, shall be denied a permit to connect any facilities to the sewer which will discharge more than the proportionate share allotted to the property. However, if such additional discharge will not immediately but may in the future overload the sewer, a conditional permit to connect to the sewer may be issued after the owner of the property agrees by a covenant satisfactory to the county engineer recorded against the land to construct or to share in the cost of construction of additional sewer capacity at such future time as the county engineer determines that an overload situation exists or is imminent.
B.
The owner of the property shall supply a faithful performance bond guaranteeing compliance with the terms of the covenant, in a penal sum which, in the opinion of the county engineer, equals the future cost of construction of sewer facilities to carry such additional discharge.
C.
The faithful performance bond shall be kept in full force and effect until such additional discharge is discontinued or until such additional sewer facilities are completed, and this obligation shall pass to succeeding owners of the property.
D.
If any owner fails to supply and keep in effect the required faithful performance bond or fails to comply with the terms of the covenant, the conditional permit allowing such additional discharge may be revoked, and the continuing of such additional discharge thereafter will constitute a violation of this Division 2.
E.
The provisions of this section shall also apply to any property previously connected to a public sewer, the discharge from which is later proposed to be increased or is found to have been increased substantially beyond the proportionate share of public sewer capacity allotted to the property.
F.
The provisions of this section do not apply to properties subject to the requirements of Ordinance 7888, entitled "West Hollywood and Sherman Sewer Charge Ordinance," and set forth in Division 3 of this title, nor to properties subject to any similar ordinance now or hereafter enacted which requires payment for such additional sewer capacity prior to the issuance of a building or sewer connection permit.
(Ord. 10020 § 3 (part), 1970: Ord. 8690 § 6 (part), 1964: Ord. 6130 Part 5 Ch. 1 § 5110, 1952.)

The temporary sewage disposal system is approved by the county engineer, the director of public health, and all other state and local regulatory agencies having jurisdiction. The conditions for such approvals shall include a stated time limit for the use of such temporary system, and shall provide for the termination of such use and the connection to the guaranteed permanent sewage disposal system;
E.

If the shape of lot is other than the usual rectangular shape, or unusual in area, and the strict adherence to the above mentioned provision would require payment of an amount not commensurate with the benefits to be received, the provisions of this section as to the amount to be charged may be modified as determined by the county engineer. In no case shall the charge be less than $300.00, unless reduced by the charges of another public entity as provided in Section 20.32.160.

B.
Further, if such lot may in the future be included in a special assessment improvement district which would provide sewers for such lot and adjoining area, such connection permit shall not be issued until the connection charge specified by Section 20.32.130 and any other applicable charges have been paid, and the property owner has executed and recorded in the office of the county recorder a waiver which states that he will not protest inclusion in, and will pay the assessment for, such improvement district.
