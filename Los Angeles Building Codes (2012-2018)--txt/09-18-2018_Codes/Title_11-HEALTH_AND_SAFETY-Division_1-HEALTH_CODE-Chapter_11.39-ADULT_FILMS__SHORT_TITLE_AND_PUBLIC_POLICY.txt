The administrative review shall be held within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of a request. A failure to request an administrative review within fifteen (15) calendar days shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such review.

4.
In the case of a request for reinspection as set forth in subsection E.3 above, the department shall reinspect as soon as practical. In the event the deficiencies noted in the notice to comply are corrected to the satisfaction of the health officer, the department has discretion to reinstate or modify any suspension of a permit and cancel or modify any fine imposed pursuant to this subsection F. If the department determines that the deficiencies identified in the notice to comply have been corrected, but the department elects not to reinstate the suspension or cancel the fine imposed pursuant to this subsection F, the department shall notify the permittee of this decision in writing. The permittee shall have fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of said notification to seek an administrative review of this decision.
F.
The department may, after an administrative review or waiver thereof, modify, suspend, revoke or continue all such action previously imposed upon a permittee pursuant to this chapter or impose any fine imposed by law for violations of this chapter or any other laws or standards affecting public health and safety, including but not limited to the Los Angeles County Code, the California Health and Safety Code, the blood borne pathogen standard, California Code of Regulations Title 8, section 5193 or the exposure control plan of the permittee, or any combination thereof, or for interference with a county health officer's performance of duty.

A permit issued pursuant to this chapter may be reissued or reinstated, if the department determines that the conditions which prompted the suspension or revocation no longer exist and any fine imposed pursuant to this chapter has been satisfied.
H.
In the event a permit is suspended or revoked, the producer of adult films whose permit was revoked shall cease filming any adult film unless and until the permit is reinstated or reissued.
