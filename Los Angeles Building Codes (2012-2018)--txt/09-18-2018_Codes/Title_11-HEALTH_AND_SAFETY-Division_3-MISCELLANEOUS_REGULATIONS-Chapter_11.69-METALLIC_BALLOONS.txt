Chapter 11.69 - METALLIC BALLOONS

11.69.010 - Metallic balloons.
A.
Finding. The board of supervisors hereby finds and declares that metallic balloons, when released outdoors, have a propensity to get tangled in high voltage power lines and cause short circuiting, power outages, fire, explosions, and power lines falling to the ground. These interruptions of power disrupt and endanger the lives of the residents of the county. Therefore the use of metallic balloons is discouraged, especially when large quantities are used for advertising or other commercial use.
B.
Ban. It shall be unlawful to allow one or more metallic balloons to float, rise or remain aloft outdoors at a height of five feet or more for any advertising, promotional or commercial purpose.
D.
Duty to Warn. Any person or entity who sells metallic balloons shall cause a sign or notice to be posted or displayed on the premises where the balloons are sold which complies with each of the following requirements:
1.
The sign or notice shall read substantially as follows:
WARNING. METALLIC BALLOONS ARE CONDUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY. DO NOT USE NEAR ANY SOURCE OF ELECTRIC POWER. DO NOT RELEASE OUTDOORS. CONTACT WITH TRANSMISSION LINES CAN CAUSE SHORT CIRCUITING, POWER OUTAGES AND FIRE.
2.
In no event shall the sign or notice be smaller than eight inches wide and eight inches long, nor shall any lettering thereon be less than one inch in height.
3.
At least one sign or notice shall be placed so as to assure that it can be read from all counter locations available to the public.
4.
In the event a substantial number of the public patronizing the premises offering for sale or dispensing for consideration, metallic balloons, uses a language other than English as a primary language, the sign or notice shall be worded in both English and the primary language or languages involved.
