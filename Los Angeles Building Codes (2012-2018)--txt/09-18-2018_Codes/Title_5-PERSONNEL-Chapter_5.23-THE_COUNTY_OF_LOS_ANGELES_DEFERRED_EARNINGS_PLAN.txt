Chapter 5.23 - THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DEFERRED EARNINGS PLAN

5.23.010 - Adopted—Purpose.
The County of Los Angeles, pursuant to the order of its board of supervisors, adopts a profit sharing plan known as "The County of Los Angeles Deferred Earnings Plan," effective as of December 31, 1985. This amendment and restatement of the Plan shall constitute an amendment, restatement and continuation of the Plan to be effective as of January 1, 1997 unless a provision expressly states otherwise. Certain provisions of this amendment and restatement, however, are effective before or after the effective date. Provisions which are effective prior to the Effective Date shall be deemed to amend the corresponding provisions of the Plan as amended and in effect before this restatement. Events occurring before the applicable effective date of any provisions of this restatement shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Plan in effect on the date of the event. Effective May 30, 2008, this Plan is merged into the County of Los Angeles Savings Plan, established and maintained under Chapter 5.26 of the Los Angeles County Code; accordingly, as of that date, the provisions of this Chapter shall be inoperative and the rights of Participants under this Plan shall be governed by the terms of the Savings Plan as set forth in Chapter 5.26. The purpose of the plan is to permit employees to defer a portion of their compensation and provide for retirement, disability and death benefits. The plan is a retirement benefit enhancement provided to employees subsequent to the withdrawal of the county from the Social Security System effective December 31, 1982.
While the county intends to continue the plan, it reserves the right to amend and/or terminate the plan, in whole or in part, at any time. Benefits under the plan shall at any time be limited to those that are payable from participant's accounts to the extent then funded by the county's contributions that have already been made and credited to such accounts. Therefore, while participants' existing account balances are at all times fully protected, neither participation in the plan nor eligibility therefore shall entitle any employee to have the plan or any of its provisions continued for his benefit in the future.

B.
Payments to Trustee.
1.
Matching Contributions shall be paid to the Trustee in cash at least monthly and shall be based upon the amount of Tax Deferred Contributions made during the month for which such Matching Contributions are made.

Provision Pursuant to Code Section 415(c).
1.
Definitions. For the purposes of this Section 5.23.050F and Section 5.23.050G, the following definitions apply:
a.
"Annual Addition" means the sum of the following amounts: (1) all contributions made by the County that are allocated to a Participant's account under a qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the County, (2) all contributions made by the Participant to a qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the County, (3) all forfeitures allocated to a Participant's account under a qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the County, and (4) any amount allocated to an individual medical benefit account (as defined in Code Section 415(l)(2)) of a Participant that is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the County (except that the 25 percent of 415 Compensation limit, or, for Limitation Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, the 100 percent of 415 Compensation limit, does not apply to such an individual medical benefit account).
b.
"County" means any entity the employees of which, together with employees of the County, are required to be treated as if they were employed by a single employer under Code Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) (taking into account any adjustment made pursuant to Code Section 415(h)), and any entity whose employees are treated as employees of the County under Code Section 414(n).
c.
"Limitation Year" means the twelve consecutive month period used by a qualified plan for the purposes of computing the limitations on benefits and annual additions under Code Section 415. The Limitation Year for this Plan is the Plan Year.
2.
Limit on Contributions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, for Limitation Years before January 1, 2007, the Annual Addition for a Participant for any Limitation Year shall in no event exceed the lesser of (1) $30,000.00 or such higher adjusted amount as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Code Section 415(d) to reflect increases in the cost of living, or (2) 25 percent of the Participant's 415 Compensation during the Plan Year. For Limitation Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, the Annual Addition for a Participant for any Limitation Year shall not exceed the lesser of (y) $40,000, as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living under Code Section 415(d), or (z) 100 percent of the Participant's 415 Compensation for the Plan Year.
3.
Excess Annual Additions. If a Participant's Annual Additions would exceed the limitations of subsection F2 for a Limitation Year, Matching Contributions allocable to such Participant's Account for such Limitation Year shall, to the extent necessary to cause the limitation in subsection F2 to be satisfied, be held in a suspense account and used to reduce Matching Contributions for the next Limitation Year for that Participant if such Participant is covered by the Plan at the end of such Limitation Year; and if he is not covered by the Plan at the end of any such Limitation Year, the Matching Contributions held in the suspense account shall be allocated and reallocated pro rata (based on each Participant's Eligible Earnings) to the Accounts of other Participants, except that such allocation or reallocation shall not cause the limitations of subsection F2 to be exceeded for any other Participant for any other Limitation Year. Investment gains and losses shall not be allocated to the suspense account during the period such suspense account is required to be maintained. In the event of the termination of this Plan while there exists a balance in the suspense account, to the extent such balance cannot be allocated to Participant's Account without violating the limitations of this section, such balance shall revert to the County. If the allocation of Matching Contributions to the suspense account as described herein is not sufficient to cause the limitations of subsection B to be satisfied, Tax Deferred Contributions made for such Participant for such Limitation Year (together with gains attributable thereto) shall be returned to him to the extent necessary to satisfy the limitations under subsection F2. In the event a reduction is necessary to satisfy subsection B, and the Participant participates in two or more defined contribution plans maintained by the County, the excess amount to be reduced will be deemed to consist of the Annual Addition last allocated. If an excess amount was allocated to a Participant on an allocation date of this Plan that coincides with an allocation date of another plan, the excess amount attributed to this Plan (to be reduced as provided above) will be the product of (1) the total excess amount allocated as of such date, and (2) the ratio of the Annual Addition allocated to the Participant for the Limitation Year under this Plan to the total Annual Additions allocated to the Participant for the Limitation Year for this and all other qualified defined contribution plans.
4.
Aggregation of Plans. For the purposes of applying the limitations set forth in this Section 5.23.050F and Section 5.23.050G, all qualified defined benefit plans (whether or not terminated) ever maintained by the County shall be treated as one defined benefit plan, and all qualified defined contribution plans (whether or not terminated) ever maintained by the County shall be treated as one defined contribution plan.
G.
Provision Pursuant to Code Section 415(e). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the case of a Participant who is also a participant in any defined benefit plan qualified under Code Section 401(a), whether or not terminated, maintained by the County, the sum of the fraction attributable to this Plan (as determined under Code Section 415(e)(3)) and the fraction attributable to such defined benefit plan (as determined under Code Section 415(e) (2)) for any Plan Year shall in no event exceed 1.0. In the event a reduction is necessary to avoid exceeding the limitation set forth in this subsection, the affected Participant's annual additions under this Plan shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding such limitation. This Section 5.23.050G shall be inapplicable for Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2000.

Both such Accounts are referred to herein as a Participant's "Account" and the interest of each Participant hereunder at any time shall consist of his Account balance (as determined in subsection E2 of this section) as of the last preceding Valuation Date plus credits and minus debits to such Account since that Valuation Date.
C.
Investment by Participants.
1.
Each Participant may instruct the Trustee or TPA, as applicable, to allocate his Tax Deferred Contributions and his Matching Contributions if such Matching Contributions are 100 percent vested and nonforfeitable (collectively, "Contributions") among the Investment Funds. A Participant may change the allocation of future Contributions and may transfer past Contributions, adjusted for earnings, gains and losses, and applicable Plan charges, if any, from one Investment Fund to another. Any change to amounts already credited to a Participant's Account will be based on the value of such Account on the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date that such change is effective. A Participant may make investment elections at the time and manner prescribed by procedures established from time to time by the Administrative Committee.
2.
In addition, effective October 1, 1999 each Participant likewise may instruct the Trustee or TPA, as applicable, to allocate among the investment funds, the portion of his or her Matching Contributions that is vested and nonforfeitable in accordance with Section 5.23.060 C1.
D.
Investment by Administrative Committee. Plan assets that are not invested pursuant to Participant instructions under Section 5.23.060 C, including but not limited to Plan assets for which no Participant investment instructions are received, nonvested Matching Contributions that are not subject to Participant instructions under Section 5.23.060 C, forfeiture accounts, accumulated fees and unallocated Plan earnings, shall be invested by the Trustee as instructed by the Administrative Committee in one or more Investment Funds as the Administrative Committee in its discretion may determine.
E.
Trust Fund Allocation and Valuation.
1.
Allocation.
a.
Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrative Committee, the assets credited to each Participant's Accounts shall be allocated among the Investment Funds in accordance with the investment option or options chosen by such Participant or the Administrative Committee, as the case may be, effective no later than the first business day following the business day on which the Trustee or its Agent has received appropriate instructions, or such later date as is commercially reasonable under the circumstances.
b.
As of each Valuation Date, the net gain or loss of each Investment Fund, determined in accordance with Section 5.23.060 E2 below, shall be allocated by the Trustee or its Agent in accordance with the instructions received by the Trustee from the TPA to the Accounts of Participants in such Investment Funds in proportion to the amounts of such Accounts invested in such Investment Fund on such Valuation Date, exclusive of amounts to be credited but including amounts (other than the net loss, if any, determined pursuant to Section 5.23.060 E2) to be debited to such Accounts as of such Valuation Date.
2.
Valuation.
a.
As of the close of business each Valuation Date, the TPA shall determine or cause to be determined the value of each Investment Fund. The TPA may rely on net asset value calculations, book values and other data with respect to the value of Plan assets held in the Investment Funds furnished to it by the Administrative Committee, Investment Managers, the County Treasurer, custodians or other entities authorized to provide valuation data. The TPA shall communicate such valuation to the Trustee. The TPA shall be responsible for monthly reconciliation of its records with the records of the third-parties from which it receives valuation data.
b.
Each such valuation shall be made on the basis of the net gain or loss to each such Investment Fund between the current Valuation Date and the last preceding Valuation Date. The net gain or loss of an Investment Fund shall include realized and unrealized earnings, interest income, dividends actually paid and other income of such Fund during such period, and shall be reduced by expenses paid, if any, that are to be charged to such Investment Fund in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement. The transfer of funds to or from an Investment Fund, the allocation of Tax Deferred Contributions and Matching Contributions, and payments, distributions and withdrawals from an Investment Fund to provide benefits under the Plan for Participants or Beneficiaries shall not be deemed to be income, expenses or losses of the Investment Fund. A similar valuation shall be made at any other time the TPA, Administrative Committee or its Agent deems it appropriate to make such a valuation.
c.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Committee or its Agent may, in accordance with applicable requirements of applicable law, instruct the TPA to (1) adopt such accounting procedures as the Administrative Committee or its Agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to establish a proportionate crediting of net gain or loss of an Investment Fund and of Contributions made to an Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date, and (2) adopt such other valuation procedures as the Administrative Committee or its Agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to determine the value of the Investment Funds. Subject to the TPA's rights and duties under the contract between it and the County, the reasonable and equitable decision of the TPA as to the value of each Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and Beneficiaries having any interest, direct or indirect, in such Investment Fund.
3.
No Guarantee Against Loss. The County, the Board, the Administrative Committee, the TPA and the Trustee do not guarantee in any manner the Investment Funds or any part thereof against loss or depreciation. All persons having an interest in the Investment Funds shall look solely to such Funds for payment with respect to such interest. The County, the Board, the Administrative Committee, the TPA and the Trustee are not authorized to advise a Participant as to that Participant's selection of Investment Funds, and the fact that designated Investment Funds are available to Participants for investment shall not be construed as a recommendation for the investment of contributions hereunder in all or any of such Funds. The selection of an Investment Fund by a Participant is his or her sole responsibility and shall constitute an exercise of control over the assets of his or her Investment Accounts. Each Participant who so exercises control shall, by such exercise, release and agree, on his or her behalf and on behalf of his or her heirs and beneficiaries, to indemnify and hold harmless the County, the Board, the Administrative Committee, the TPA, the Trustee and any Agent, officer or employee of any of them, from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, costs or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by or arising out of such exercise, including without limitation any diminution in value or losses incurred from such exercise.
(Ord. 2001-0097 § 2 (part), 2001.)
5.23.070 - Distributions and withdrawals.
A.
Distributions Only as Provided. A Participant or Beneficiary shall only be paid vested benefits under the Plan as provided in this section. A Participant or Beneficiary who is eligible to receive a distribution under the Plan shall submit an application for benefits to the Administrative Committee, furnishing such information as the Administrative Committee or its duly authorized agent may require.
B.
Nonforfeitability. Any amount credited to a Participant's Tax Deferred Contributions Account shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested. Any amount credited to a Participant's Matching Contributions Account shall vest and become nonforfeitable at the rate of 20 percent for each Year of Service completed by such Participant.
C.
Distributions on Retirement or Disability.
1.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B of this section, the entire Account of a Participant whose employment with the County terminates after he is age 70 or qualified for a service retirement benefit under the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937, as amended, if earlier, or whose employment with the County terminates because of Disability, shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested. Such Account shall be paid to the Participant or his Beneficiary, in cash, in accordance with one of the following methods as the Participant determines:
a.
A lump sum payment; or
b.
Equal monthly, quarterly or annual installments not extending over more than 15 years; or
c.
Consecutive periodic payments for the life of the Participant or for the lives of the Participant and his spouse and the last survivor of them; or
d.
A combination of the methods of payment described in subsections C1a, b and c above.
2.
All distributions hereunder shall be made or begun as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant's application is filed pursuant to subsection A of this section and approved by the Administrative Committee. For purposes of a distribution, the date that such Participant's interest in an Investment Fund is liquidated or redeemed, partially or in full, to satisfy the distribution application shall be the applicable Valuation Date.
D.
Distributions on Death.
1.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B of this section, after the death of a Participant at any time whatsoever, his entire Account shall be nonforfeitable and fully vested. Such Account shall be paid by the Trustee to the Participant's Beneficiary after the Trustee is notified by the Administrative Committee of the Participant's death.
2.
A Participant shall have the right to designate that after his death his Account shall be paid to or for his Beneficiary in accordance with one of the methods set forth in subsection C1 of this section. Any designation by a Participant of the method of payment of death benefits hereunder may be made, changed or revoked by the Participant in writing in a form prescribed by the Administrative Committee and filed with the Administrative Committee prior to the Participant's death.
3.
If a Participant does not expressly designate the method of distribution of his Account, or if such designation is for any reason not effective, such Account shall be paid to or for the Beneficiary in accordance with one of the methods set forth in subsection C1 of this section as such Beneficiary, in his discretion, shall determine and designate to the Administrative Committee.
E.
Distributions of Vested Interest.
1.
A Participant whose employment with the County terminates for any reason other than the reasons specified in subsections C or D of this section shall receive his entire Tax Deferred Contributions Account and the portion of his Matching Contributions Account in which he is vested in accordance with subsection B of this section. The portion of his Matching Contribution Account which is not so vested shall be immediately forfeited. If a Participant forfeits a portion of his Account and he is later rehired by the County, his employment with the County or participation in the Plan after such rehire shall have no effect on the amount of the forfeiture. If such a rehired Participant subsequently becomes party to another Compensation Deferral Agreement, any Matching Contributions thereafter made by the County and any earnings and investment gains or losses allocable thereto shall be credited to a separate Matching Contributions Account maintained for such Participant and shall vest as provided herein without regard to any Year of Service prior to his rehire.
2.
Amounts distributed pursuant to subsection E1 of this section shall be paid in accordance with one of the methods set forth in subsection C1 of this section as selected by the Participant.
F.
Latest Time of Distribution.
1.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, distributions under the Plan shall be made in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) (including Section 401(a)(9)(G)) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (including Section 1.401(a)(9)-2); provided, however, that such provisions shall override the other distribution provisions of the Plan only to the extent that such other Plan provisions provide for a distribution that is less rapid or of a lesser amount than required under such provisions of the Code and Regulations. Nothing contained in this Section 5.23.070F shall be construed as providing an optional form of payment that is not available under the other distribution provisions of this Section 5.23.070.
2.
General Rule. The entire interest of each Participant under the plan:
a.
Either will be distributed to him not later than his taxable year in which he attains age 70-1/2 or in his taxable year in which he retires from County service, whichever is the later (his "Required Beginning Date"); or
b.
Will be distributed, commencing not later than his Required Beginning Date, (1) in accordance with Regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, over the life of such Participant or over the lives of such Participant and his designated Beneficiary, or (2) in accordance with such Regulations, over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such Participant or the life expectancy of such Participant and his designated Beneficiary.
3.
Distributions Upon Death of a Participant. Upon the death of a Participant, the following distribution provisions will apply to limit the Beneficiary's ability to delay distributions.
4.
If the Participant dies after distribution of his benefit has begun, the remaining portion of his benefit will continue to be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used prior to the Participant's death.
5.
If the Participant dies before distribution of his benefit has begun, his entire benefit will be distributed no later than five years after his death, unless an individual who is a designated Beneficiary elects to receive distributions in substantially equal installments over the Beneficiary's life or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Beneficiary (and, if the Beneficiary is not the Participant's spouse, not extending beyond 15 years in accordance with the distribution options available under Sections 5.23.070C and D) beginning no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died. If the designated Beneficiary is the Participant's surviving spouse, the date distributions are required to begin is the later of December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died or December 31 of the calendar year in which such Participant would have attained age 70-1/2. If the spouse dies before such payments begin, subsequent distributions will be made as if the spouse had been the Participant.
6.
Generally, distributions will be treated as having begun to the Participant for the purposes of this Section 5.23.070F on the employee's Required Beginning Date, even though payments may actually have been made before that date; provided, however, that if distributions irrevocably (except for acceleration) commence to an employee under an annuity contract, distributions will be considered to have begun on the actual commencement date.
7.
Recalculation of Life Expectancies. The Participant (or the Participant's spouse if the Participant dies before distributions have begun) may elect not to recalculate annually the life expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's spouse (other than in the case of a life annuity) in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9)(D) and the Regulations thereunder. Such election must be made prior to the time of the first required distribution under Code Section 401(a)(9). If the Participant (or spouse if applicable) fails to make such election, life expectancies will be recalculated annually in accordance with the Regulations.
8.
2001 Proposed Regulations. With respect to distributions under the Plan made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the Plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of Section 401 (a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code in accordance with the regulations under Section 401 (a)(9) that were proposed on January 17, 2001, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary. This amendment shall continue in effect until the end of the last calendar year beginning before the effective date of final regulations under Section 401 (a)(9) or such other date as may be specified in guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service.
G.
Withdrawal of Contributions. Upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice filed with the Administrative Committee, effective as of the Entry Date following notification of the Trustee and Investment Manager by the Administrative Committee, a Participant who is an Employee may withdraw in cash all or a part of his Account balance as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date as provided and in the order set forth below. Except in cases of Hardship, a Participant may make only two withdrawals pursuant to this subsection per Plan Year.
1.
A Participant may withdraw all or a part of his Matching Contributions Account in which he has a vested interest but a Participant may not make a withdrawal pursuant to this subsection unless he is either credited with at least 10 Years of Service or such withdrawal is made due to Hardship.
2.
a.
Participant who has withdrawn his entire Matching Contributions Account may in addition withdraw all or a part of his Tax Deferred Contributions Account (excluding any earnings credited to such Account on or after January 1, 1989), provided that the Participant has attained age 59-1/2 or demonstrated to the Administrative Committee that he is suffering from Hardship. A withdrawal shall not be permitted for Hardship unless such withdrawal is on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant and is necessary to satisfy such financial need.
b.
Effective as of January 1, 2006, the determination of whether a Participant has an immediate and heavy financial need shall be made by the Administrative Committee on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. Nevertheless, a withdrawal shall be deemed to be made on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant if the withdrawal is on account of:
(1)
Expenses for (or necessary to obtain) medical care that would be deductible under Section 213(d) of the Code (determined without regard to whether the expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income);
(2)
The purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence of the Participant;
(3)
The payment of tuition for the next semester or quarter of post-secondary education for the Participant, the spouse, the children, or the dependents (as defined in section 152 of the Code, and for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, without regard to section 152(b)(1), (b)(2) or (d)(1)(B) of the Code);
(4)
The need to prevent the eviction of the Participant from his principal residence or the foreclosure on the mortgage of the Participant's principal residence;
(5)
On and after January 1, 2007, payment for burial or funeral expenses for the Participant's deceased parent, spouse, children or dependents (as defined in section 152 of the Code but without regard to subsection 152(d)(1)(B));
(6)
On and after January 1, 2007, expenses for the repair of damage to the Participant's principal residence that would qualify for the casualty deduction under section 165 of the Code (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income); or
(7)
Any other financial need which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, through the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of general applicability, may from time to time designate as a deemed immediate and heavy financial need as provided in Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(2)(iii)(C) of the Treasury Regulations.
c.
Effective as of January 1, 2006, a withdrawal shall not be treated as necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant to the extent the amount of the withdrawal exceeds the amount required to relieve the financial need or to the extent such need may be satisfied from other resources that are reasonably available to the Participant. The determination of whether the amount of a withdrawal is necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need shall be made by the Administrative Committee on the basis of all relevant facts and circumstances. Nevertheless, the amount of a withdrawal shall be deemed to be necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant if: (1) the amount of the distribution is not in excess of the amount of the immediate and heavy financial need; (2) the Participant has obtained all distributions (other than Hardship distributions) and nontaxable (at the time of the loan) loans available under the terms of this Plan or any other plans of deferred compensation maintained by the County; and (3) the Participant irrevocably elects to suspend all elective contributions and employee contributions under this Plan (e.g., After-Tax Contributions and Tax Deferred Contributions) and all other plans of deferred compensation maintained by the County from the date on which the withdrawal is made until the close of the six-calendar-month period that began on the first day of the month following the date on which the withdrawal is made. For the purposes of this subsection c, the term "other plans of deferred compensation" include, without limitation, all qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation plans and any cash or deferred arrangements that are part of a cafeteria plan, except that it does not include the mandatory employee contribution component of a defined benefit plan or welfare plan. For the purposes of this subsection c the County includes the County and all other employers which are required to be treated as a single "employer" under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-6.
H.
Loans to Participants.
1.
Upon application by a Participant, but subject to such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as the Administrative Committee may establish and to the provisions of this subsection, effective July l, 1987, the Administrative Committee may in its discretion direct the Trustee to make a loan or loans to a Participant from his separate account in the Participant Loan Fund in an amount not exceeding the excess of:
a.
The lesser of:
(1)
$50,000.00, reduced by the excess (if any) of:
(a)
The highest outstanding balance of loans to such Participant from the Plan during the one-year period ending on the day before the date on which such loan was made,
(b)
Over the outstanding balance of loans to such Participant from the Plan on the date on which such loan was made, or 50 percent of the vested portion of the Participant's Account balance;
b.
Over the outstanding balance of any other loan or loans from the Plan to the Participant; provided, however, that if 50 percent of the vested portion of the Participant's Account balance is less than $10,000.00, the amount in subsection H2 of this section shall be the lesser of $10,000.00 or 80 percent of the vested portion of the Participant's Account balance. The minimum loan that may be made from the Plan is $2,000.00 (or such other amount determined by the Administrative Committee). All loans hereunder shall be subject to such loan processing fees charged by the Trustee and Investment Manager as are approved by the Administrative Committee, which fees shall be paid by borrowing Participants.
2.
As soon as practicable after the receipt of all necessary information and directions from the Administrative Committee to make a loan and prior to making any loan pursuant to subsection H1 of this section, but in no event later than 30 days after the applicable Valuation Date, the Trustee or Investment Manager shall transfer, in accordance with procedures determined by the Administrative Committee, to the Participant Loan Fund from the assets invested in other Investment Funds allocated to the Account of each borrowing Participant an amount equal to the amount of such Participant's Account. The Participant Loan Fund shall be invested solely in loans to Participants made pursuant to this subsection and shall at all times be at least equal to the total amount of such loans. All interest and principal payments made by such Participants shall be credited to the separate account within the Participant Loan Fund of each Participant who borrows money from the Plan. Except as otherwise provided by the Administrative Committee, as of each Valuation Date all cash in the Participant Loan Fund shall be transferred to the other Investment Funds in accordance with each borrowing Participant's investment choice under Section 5.23.060 C.
3.
Loans made pursuant to subsection H1 of this section:
a.
Shall be secured by (l) the portion of the Participant's Account attributable to Matching Contributions and, to the extent necessary, the portion of the Participant's Account attributable to Tax Deferred Contributions, and (2) such other collateral as the Administrative Committee may require;
b.
Shall be available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis that shall not result in discrimination in favor of Employees who are officers or highly compensated within the meaning of Code Section 401; and
c.
Shall be evidenced by a promissory note executed by the Participant which provides for:
(1)
A reasonable rate of interest determined by the Administrative Committee, and
(2)
For repayment (a) within a specified period of time, which shall not extend beyond five years from the time the loan is made unless the loan proceeds are used to acquire a dwelling which within a reasonable time is to be used as a principal residence (as determined at the time the loan is made) of a Participant, in which case the promissory note shall provide for repayment within 15 years of the time the loan is made unless otherwise provided by the Administrative Committee at the time the loan is made, and (b) in substantially equal payments, at least quarterly, over the term of the loan, and (c) upon such other terms and conditions as the Administrative Committee shall determine.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, such loan shall be a first lien against the Participant's Account and any amount of principal or interest due and unpaid thereon shall be deducted from such Account before the payment of any portion thereof to the Participant or his Beneficiary.
4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, loans made to Participants under the Plan shall be due and payable upon the Participant's termination of employment with the County, whether by death, retirement or otherwise.
I.
Order of Distributions. Distributions (including withdrawals) shall be made from the applicable portion of a Participant's Account invested in the Investment Funds on a pro rata basis from each Investment Fund, unless a different order of distribution is directed by the Participant. Each Participant by written notice (in form acceptable to the Administrative Committee) signed by the Participant and filed with the Administrative Committee may direct the order in which distributions are to be made if other than on a pro rata basis.
J.
Small Accounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if a Participant's vested Account balance does not exceed $5,000.00 at the time the Participant or Beneficiary requests a distribution, such Account shall be payable to the Participant or Beneficiary only in the form of a lump sum. Additionally, if a Participant does not make a timely election regarding the distribution of his benefits after receiving the notice required under Code section 402(f), then, provided that the distribution is $1,000.00 or less, the Participant's benefits shall be distributed in a single cash payment as soon as practicable notwithstanding his failure to file an application for distribution.
K.
Lost Participants. If the Participant or his or her Beneficiary cannot be located within four years of the date the Participant's interest under the Plan is first payable, the entire balance in his or her Investment Accounts shall be forfeited; provided, however, that the amount so forfeited shall be reinstated as of the date of the subsequent filing of an application for benefits under the Plan, and payment of the lump sum benefit shall occur no later than 60 days after such application is filed.
L.
Application of Forfeitures. The Amount of Participant's Investment Accounts which is forfeited for a Plan Year in accordance with Sections 5.23.050B.2 and 5.23.070E and K shall be placed in a suspense account and applied as soon as possible to first, restore the accounts of lost Participants who have filed an application for benefits that has been approved by the Administrative Committee, if any, and second, to offset future Matching Contributions to be made by the County in accordance with Section 5.23.050D.

I.
Expense Charges to Plan.
1.
With the approval of the Board, expenses incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions defined in this Section 5.23.080 may be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the County. The expenses so charged will be allocated to the individual Participants' accounts and shall be reflected on quarterly statements. The annual charges shall not exceed the amount approved by the Board of Supervisors in the County budget, and will only include direct, additional County costs.
2.
Expenses incurred as a result of contractors performing the Plan functions described in this Section 5.23.080, TPA and Trustee fees, and the cost of fiduciary and liability insurance, are limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board, and will be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the County. The expenses, fees and costs so charged will be allocated to the individual Participants' accounts and shall be reflected on quarterly statements.
3.
In the event that the Plan accumulates (a) fees in excess of actual administrative expenses, or (b) unallocated earnings from Plan operations, the Administrative Committee shall allocate excess fees and earnings first by establishing a reserve for contingencies and payment of planned obligations not to exceed one-half of the total annual County fees charged to Participants, and then by allocating any remainder by reducing TPA fees charged to Participants by a method determined by the Administrative Committee. Effective May 29, 2008, any amounts remaining in these contingency and expense reserves shall be allocated per capita to the Accounts of the Participants who are Employees of the County on that date; provided, however, that such allocations shall be treated as Annual Additions and shall not cause the limitations of Section 5.23.050F.2. to be exceeded for any such Participant. To the extent any amounts remain unallocated due to the limits imposed under Section 5.23.050F.2., such unallocated amounts shall continue to be held in a contingency and expense reserve, which reserve shall be transferred to the corresponding reserve under the County of Los Angeles Savings Plan upon the merger of this Plan into the Savings Plan.
J.
Compliance With Laws. The Administrative Committee shall have the duty to make changes in the administration of this Plan which are necessary to comply with federal or State of California laws.

5.23.100 - Nonalienation.
To the extent permitted by law and except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no right or interest of any kind of a Participant or Beneficiary hereunder shall be transferable or assignable by the Participant or Beneficiary, nor shall any such right or interest be subject to alienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment, execution or levy of any kind, voluntary or involuntary.
(Ord. 2001-0097 § 2 (part), 2001.)
5.23.105 - Rights of an Alternate Payee under a QDRO.
A.
Notwithstanding Section 5.23.100, an Alternate Payee shall have the right to make a claim for any benefits awarded to the Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO as provided in this section. If an Alternate Payee is awarded a specified interest in the Accounts of the Participant pursuant to a QDRO, such interest of the Alternate Payee shall be segregated and separately accounted for by the Trustee in the name and for the benefit of the Alternate Payee.
B.
Upon receipt of a domestic relations order, or, if earlier, notice that a domestic relations order may be sought, the Administrative Committee shall suspend distributions from the Participant's Investment Accounts, and shall take steps to ensure that the Participant and each Alternate Payee is aware of the order or proposed order and the suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Accounts. Moreover, the Administrative Committee shall determine, within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, whether such order is a QDRO. If the order is determined to be a QDRO, the Alternate Payee's interest under such order shall be segregated and/or distributed in accordance with the QDRO and this Section 5.23.105. If the order is determined not to be a QDRO, and the domestic relations order is not modified as necessary to constitute a QDRO within a reasonable period of time after such determination, the suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Accounts shall be discontinued. If an order is not received within a reasonable period of time after the County has been notified that such an order is being sought, the suspension of distributions from the Participant's Investment Accounts shall be discontinued.
C.
Distributions to the Alternate Payee shall be made in accordance with the QDRO provided that the QDRO does not conflict with the Plan's distribution provisions or the provisions of this section. Regardless of whether the Participant is eligible to take a distribution under the Plan, the QDRO may provide for an immediate distribution of the Alternate Payee's interest thereunder to the Alternate Payee. If a QDRO does not provide the form of distribution of benefits payable to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee shall have the right to elect distribution in any form provided under this section. Pursuant to the QDRO or the Alternate Payee's election, the Alternate Payee's interest may be distributed in cash in a lump sum payment or in equal monthly, quarterly or annual installments not extending over more than 15 years.
D.
The Alternate Payee's interest specified in the QDRO shall be segregated and/or distributed from the Participant's Accounts, and the Investment Funds in which such Accounts are invested, on a pro rata basis.
E.
Following the determination that a domestic relations order is a QDRO, and segregation of an Alternate Payee's interest, the Alternate Payee shall have the right to direct the investment of his or her interest in the same manner as provided under Section 5.23.060C with respect to the Participant. The Participant shall continue to have the right to direct the investment of the portion of his or her Accounts that is not awarded to the Alternate Payee pursuant to the QDRO.
F.
Unless the QDRO provides otherwise, an Alternate Payee shall have the right, in the same manner as a Participant, to designate a Beneficiary, who shall receive benefits payable to the Alternate Payee in the event that all of the Alternate Payee's benefits have not been distributed at the time of the Alternate Payee's death. If the Alternate Payee does not designate a Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary predeceases the Alternate Payee, benefits payable to the Alternate Payee which have not been distributed shall be paid to the Alternate Payee's estate. Any death benefits payable under this section shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the Alternate Payee's death, with or without the Beneficiary's request.
(Ord. 2001-0097 § 2 (part), 2001.)
5.23.110 - Facility of payment.
Whenever any Participant entitled to benefits under the Plan shall be under a legal disability or, in the sole judgment of the Administrative Committee, shall otherwise be unable to apply benefits to his own best interest and advantage, the Trustee, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, may make payments to the Participant's legal representative, and the decision of the Administrative Committee shall completely discharge the liability of the Plan, the Administrative Committee, the County and the Trustee with respect to such benefits.
(Ord. 2001-0097 § 2 (part), 2001.)
5.23.120 - No enlargement of employment rights.
A Participant by accepting benefits under the Plan does not thereby agree to continue for any period in the employ of the County, and the County by adopting the Plan, making contributions or taking any action with respect to the Plan does not obligate itself to continue the employment of any Participant for any period.
(Ord. 2001-0097 § 2 (part), 2001.)
5.23.130 - Severability provision.
If any provision of the Plan or the application thereof to any circumstance or person is invalid the remainder of the Plan and the application of such provision to other circumstances or persons shall not be affected thereby.
(Ord. 2001-0097 § 2 (part), 2001.)
5.23.140 - Amendment or termination.
A.
Right to Amend or Terminate. Subject to the limitations of Section 5.23.050E, the Board of Supervisors of the County has reserved, and does hereby reserve, the right at any time or times, without the consent of any Participant, Beneficiary or other person, (l) to terminate the Plan, in whole or in part or as to any designated group of Eligible Employees, Participants and their Beneficiaries, or (2) to amend the Plan, in whole or in part. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.23.050B no such termination or amendment shall decrease the amount to be contributed by the County on account of any period prior to the date such termination or amendment is approved by the Board of Supervisors of the County.
B.
Procedure for Termination or Amendment. Any termination or amendment of the Plan pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be expressed in an instrument executed by the County on the order of its Board of Supervisors and filed with the Trustee, and shall become effective as of the date designated in such instrument or, if no date is so designated, on its execution.
C.
Distribution Upon Termination Without Maintenance of a Successor Plan. Effective as of January 1, 2006, if the Plan shall be terminated by the County, subject to the final sentence of subsection A, County Contributions shall cease, and the Investment Funds shall be distributed as if each Participant had then retired pursuant to Section 5.23.070.C at the time of the termination, provided that the County (or any related "employer" as defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-6) does not maintain a successor plan within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(4).
D.
Vesting on Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, upon the termination or partial termination of the Plan or upon complete discontinuance of contributions under the Plan, the rights of all Employees to benefits accrued to the date of such termination or partial termination or discontinuance, to the extent then funded, or the amounts credited to the Employee's Account shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable.
E.
Failure to Qualify Under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Plan shall be subject to the issuance by the Internal Revenue Service of either (1) a determination or ruling to the effect that the Plan (as modified by any amendment thereto made for the purpose of securing such determination or ruling) meets the applicable requirements of Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code for a qualified governmental plan containing a qualified cash or deferred arrangement, or (2) a determination or ruling with respect to the Plan that is acceptable to the County. If the County does not receive such a determination or ruling within 12 months after it requests it or, if earlier, within 24 months after the Plan is adopted by the County, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the County may elect to declare the Plan to be retroactively void by giving written notice to the Trustee that no such Internal Revenue Service determination or ruling has been received.
F.
Temporary Suspension of Plan Provisions. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, during any conversion period (including but not limited to a change of Trustee, TPA or Investment Funds), in accordance with procedures established by the Administrative Committee, the Administrative Committee may temporarily suspend, in whole or in part, certain provisions of the Plan, which may include, but are not limited to, a Participant's right to change his contribution election, a Participant's right to change his investment election and a Participant's right to borrow or withdraw from his Account or obtain a distribution from his Account.
(Ord. 2008-0022 § 3, 2008; Ord. 2007-0001 § 2, 2007; Ord. 2001-0097 § 2 (part), 2001.)

A Participant in this Plan who receives a distribution from the qualified plan of another employer, within 60 days after he receives the distribution, may transfer ("Rollover") any part or all of the amount distributed from the plan of the other employer to his Tax Deferred Contributions Account in this Plan, provided that a Rollover from the other plan is permitted by the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.
