5.09.010 - Policy of statement.
It is the policy of the County to preserve the dignity and professionalism of the workplace as well as to protect the right of employees to be free from discrimination, unlawful harassment, retaliation and/or inappropriate conduct toward others based on a protected status. Discrimination, unlawful harassment, retaliation and/or inappropriate conduct on the basis of sex, race, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, ethnicity, age (40 and over), disability, sexual orientation, marital status, medical condition or any other protected characteristic protected by State or federal employment laws are unacceptable. Inappropriate conduct based on a protected status includes conduct that may not meet the legal definition of discrimination or unlawful harassment. County employees are responsible for conducting themselves according to this policy, including the reporting of conduct which potentially violates this policy.
