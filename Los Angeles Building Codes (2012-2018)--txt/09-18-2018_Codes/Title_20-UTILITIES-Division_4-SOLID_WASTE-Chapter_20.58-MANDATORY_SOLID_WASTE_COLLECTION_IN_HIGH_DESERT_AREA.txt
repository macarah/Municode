Chapter 20.58 - MANDATORY SOLID WASTE COLLECTION IN HIGH DESERT AREA

20.58.010 - Purpose of chapter.
It is found and determined that the unlawful disposal of solid waste is widespread in the unincorporated High Desert Area of the county of Los Angeles with associated public health hazards, and that the required periodic collection of solid waste from all occupied properties in High Desert Area protects the health and safety of all owners and occupants of High Desert Area properties and premises, protects the environment, and improves the quality of life in the High Desert Area for all occupied properties.
(Ord. 2007-0002 § 6 (part), 2007.)
20.58.020 - Mandatory solid waste collection.
For all occupied properties in the High Desert Area, where the county does not otherwise provide solid waste collection services, it is mandatory for the owner and/or occupant of the property to utilize the solid waste collection services of a permitted waste collector at least once weekly or, alternatively, to obtain a self-hauler permit and transport, at least once weekly, all solid waste accumulated or stored on the property, except for inert materials as defined in Title 27, Section 20230 of the California Code of Regulations, to a solid waste facility that is legally authorized to accept such waste.
(Ord. 2007-0002 § 6 (part), 2007.)

A.
A self-hauler permit will not be approved by the enforcement agency unless the applicant adequately documents that he or she can properly transport all solid waste accumulated or stored on property owned or occupied by the applicant in a safe and sanitary manner to an authorized solid waste facility.
B.
An application for a self-hauler permit shall be submitted in accordance with Section 20.64.040 of this code and shall be accompanied by evidence of prepayment of the minimum gate fee at any authorized solid waste facility for a period of three months with a frequency of once a week.
C.
All solid waste removal pursuant to a valid self-hauler permit shall be accomplished by the permittee or the permittee's employees using the permittee's own equipment.
D.
Passenger motor vehicles, as defined in section 465 of the California Vehicle Code, may be used by a self-hauler to transport solid waste from a residential property to an authorized solid waste facility only if the solid waste is so contained as to prevent it from leaking, dripping, falling, blowing, or scattering from the vehicle in which it is being transported. The use of other vehicles used to transport solid waste shall comply with the provisions of Section 20.72.150 of this code.
E.
On or before the tenth day of each quarter, the permittee shall submit legible copies of solid waste facility receipts to the enforcement agency demonstrating that solid waste has been transported at least once weekly during the previous quarter to an authorized solid waste facility, with exceptions provided for periods of at least seven consecutive days in which the property remains unoccupied. A written request for any exception must be submitted in advance to the enforcement agency. Failure to submit receipts shall be grounds for revocation or denial of a permit.
