20.80.010 - Investigations—Authorized when—Procedures.
A.
An enforcement agency, in issuing or reviewing any solid-waste facilities permit or in connection with any action relating thereto or with any authorized enforcement activity, may investigate the operation by any person of a transfer/processing station, or disposal site, collection or handling equipment, or storage area for solid wastes within its jurisdiction.
B.
In such an investigation, the enforcement agency or the board may require that any person who is or proposes to become an operator of a transfer/processing station, disposal site, collection or handling equipment, or storage area for solid wastes within its jurisdiction, shall furnish, under penalty of perjury, such technical or monitoring program reports or other reports as the enforcement agency may specify.
C.
In such an investigation, the enforcement agency may inspect the facility, equipment or vehicle used for storage, collection, transportation, processing or disposal of solid waste, as necessary to ensure compliance with the law and that solid-waste facilities or waste collector permits are being complied with. Such inspection shall be made with the consent of the owner or possessor of such facilities or, if such consent is refused, with a warrant duly issued pursuant to the procedure set forth in Title 13 (commencing with Section 1822.50) of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure; provided, however, that in the event of an emergency affecting the public health or safety such inspection may be made without consent or the issuance of a warrant.

A.
Any person having information tending to prove that a facility or business is being operated without a required permit, in violation of one or more terms or conditions of a permit, in violation of the standards, or in violation of any related enactment, that a permit was obtained wholly or partially by misrepresentation or nondisclosure of relevant facts, or that modification of a permit is required to bring a facility into compliance with an enactment, may report such information in writing to the enforcement agency. The report shall include the following:
1.
The name, address and telephone number of the person making the report; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the making of anonymous reports by omitting the identity of the reporting party from the report;
2.
The identity and location, if known, of the facility and the names and addresses, if known, of the persons responsible for the violation;
3.
The nature of the violation; and
4.

B.
The person making the report may forward a copy to the board. Unless the report unambiguously indicates that a copy has been provided the board, the enforcement agency shall, within 15 days of its receipt, forward a copy to the board.
C.
Upon receipt of a report, the enforcement agency shall within 15 days examine the report and determine whether its allegations, if true, would constitute grounds for an enforcement action. Should the enforcement agency determine that the report fails to allege facts constituting grounds for an enforcement action, it shall so advise the reporting party in writing at the address given in the report if an address is given; in any event, the enforcement agency shall advise the board in writing of such a determination within five business days.
D.
The enforcement agency may decline to investigate a report alleging facts that would constitute grounds for an enforcement action if, in its judgment, investigation is unwarranted because the allegations are contrary to facts known to the enforcement agency. Should the enforcement agency decline to investigate on that ground, it shall so advise the reporting party in writing at the address given in the report if an address is given; in any event, the enforcement agency shall advise the board in writing of such a determination within five business days.
