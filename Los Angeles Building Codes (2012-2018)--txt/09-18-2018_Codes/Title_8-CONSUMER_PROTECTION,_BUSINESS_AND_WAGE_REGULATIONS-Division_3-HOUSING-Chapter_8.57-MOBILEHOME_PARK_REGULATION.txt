Chapter 8.57 - MOBILEHOME PARK REGULATION

8.57.010 - Purpose of provisions.
A.
There is presently within the county of Los Angeles a shortage of spaces for the location of mobilehomes. Because of this shortage, there is a low vacancy rate and rents are presently rising rapidly and causing concern among a substantial number of county mobilehome park residents. Because of the high cost of moving mobilehomes; the potential for damage resulting therefrom; the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes, including permits, landscaping and site preparation; the lack of alternative homesites for mobilehome residents; and the substantial investment of mobilehome owners in such homes, a virtual monopoly exists in the rental of mobilehome park spaces, creating a situation where park owners have unbridled discretion and ability to exploit mobilehome park tenants.
B.
For these reasons, among others, the board of supervisors finds and declares it necessary to protect the owners and occupiers of mobilehomes from unreasonable rent increases, while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a fair return on their property and rental income sufficient to cover increases in the costs of repairs, maintenance, insurance, employee services, and additional amenities, and other costs of operation.

(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 6, 1987.)
8.57.060 - Rent increases—Commission approval required when.
On or after January 29, 1988, the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, no increase in space rents in the mobilehome parks covered by this chapter shall be effective unless approved by the commission as set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 7, 1987.)
8.57.070 - Rent increases—Computation and determination.
A.
Formula Increases. Mobilehome park base rents and space rents may be increased by no more than 75 percent of the percentage change in the CPI for the applicable CPI adjustment period, or by no more than eight percent per year, whichever is less. Increases in user fees shall be subject to the same limitation. Increases in user fees for coin-operated devices owned by the owner may accumulate to accommodate the capacity of the devices so long as the total increase is within the limits.
B.
Increases which satisfy the formula requirements shall be approved by the commission as a matter of course, subject to the provisions of subsection B of Section 8.57.140 of this chapter.
C.
Calculation of the one-year limitation on rental increases herein shall be from the date the last increase became effective at the particular mobilehome park.
D.
Owner Costs to be Passed Through to Tenant. Tenant shall pay to owner, on the herein described terns, no less than 60 days after owner has notified tenant in writing, the following increased costs of owner, to be passed through to tenant as separately listed items on monthly statement:
1.
Government Required Services.
a.
For the purposes of this chapter, "government required services" shall be defined as services required by governmental agencies which are new or in addition to those services legally required to be provided by owner to tenant or to the mobilehome park on January 29, 1988, the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
b.
Such services include fees, bonds, assessments, and charges legally levied by an agency of federal, state or local government upon the owner. Such services do not include predictable expenses for operation of the mobilehome park, such as common-area utilities expenses or expenses which maintain the safe and healthful use of mobilehome park facilities.
c.
The owner's actual out-of-pocket costs of providing governmentally required services may be passed through to the tenant upon 60 days' written notice, using the following formula: Amount actually paid by the owner, divided by the total number of spaces in the mobilehome park, divided by 12 months, equals the monthly sum for government-required services to be passed through to the tenant. Notwithstanding the formula described above, only those costs of providing governmentally required services in the 12 months immediately preceding the proposed pass-through shall be reimbursed to the owner by the tenant in the manner herein described. The owner shall pass-through to the tenant only those costs for governmentally required services which are not reimbursed to the owner by insurance or other sources.
2.
Real Property Taxes. For the purpose of this chapter, "real property taxes" means and shall be defined as county taxes levied against the assessed valuation of the mobilehome park which are normally payable to the county tax collector pursuant to state law on the tenth day of December and on the tenth day of April of each calendar year. Such taxes shall not include the owner's income taxes or assessments subject to pass-through to tenant as "government-required services." New real property taxes assessed to the owner as a result of new construction or remodeling of the mobilehome park's common areas after January 29, 1988, the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, shall be passed through to the tenant in the same manner as other real property tax increases. In the event that the owner's real property taxes increase in excess of two percent over the taxes levied for the preceding county fiscal year, the amount of the increase in excess of two percent may be passed through to the tenant upon 60 days' written notice, using the following formula: Amount actually paid by the owner for increased real property taxes in excess of two percent over previous year, divided by the total number of spaces in the mobilehome park, divided by 12 months, equals the monthly sum for increase in real property taxes to be passed through to the tenants. Increased taxes as a result of transfer of "change of ownership," as defined pursuant to Article XIII A of the California Constitution, will not be passed through to the tenants.
E.
Equalization Adjustment. Not later than 30 days after January 29, 1988, the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, an owner may apply for an adjustment to the base rent for individual spaces where adjustment is necessary to correct inequities caused by the rent freeze imposed as of December 31, 1984. The application shall state the reasons why the base rent was not equal to that charged comparable spaces.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 8, 1987.)
8.57.080 - Capital improvement pass-through.
A.
Subject to the vote requirements and the capital improvement limitations hereafter described, and also subject to review by the commission pursuant to Section 8.57.100 of this chapter, the actual net costs of a capital improvement plus an interest charge to compensate the owner for the use of money in making the improvement, as described below, may be passed through to the tenant upon 60 days' written notice, using the following formula: Net amount actually paid by the owner for capital improvement, plus an interest charge as described below, divided by the total number of homesites in the mobilehome park affected by the improvement, divided by 60 months (the amortization period for the capital improvement) equals the monthly sum for capital improvements to be passed through to the tenants.
B.
The interest charge that may be added to the costs of materials and labor is 33.5 percent. This is derived from the 12-percent interest rate used by the Internal Revenue Service in calculating overpayment and underpayment of federal income taxes, computed on a declining balance over a five-year period with equal monthly payments (the five-year period represents the amount of time allowed for fully amortizing the cost of capital improvements).
C.
Alternative Amortization Periods and Interest Charges.
EXPAND
Period: 120 months Interest Charge: 72.2% of actual costs
108 months 64.0% of actual costs
96 months 56.0% of actual costs
84 months 48.3% of actual costs
72 months 40.1% of actual costs
60 months 33.5% of actual costs
36 months 19.1% of actual costs
12 months 6.6% of actual costs
  D.
Installation of individual capital improvements with a cost to owner which would result in a pass-through monthly payment to affected tenants in excess of five percent of base rent shall be contingent upon the majority approval of all affected tenants of the mobilehome park. Tenants at such elections to approve or reject a proposed capital improvement shall be entitled to one written ballot vote per affected space in the mobilehome park. Individual capital improvements costing less than the amount that would result in a pass-through monthly payment to affected tenants in excess of five percent of base rent shall not require the approval of tenants of the mobilehome park so long as the cumulative total of pass-through monthly payments resulting from such projects does not exceed 10 percent of base rent hereafter described. Capital improvement projects mandated by governmental authorities to protect the health or safety of the mobilehome park by tenant shall be exempt from the tenant-vote requirement described in this subsection.
E.
Capital improvements which may be passed through to tenants shall not exceed a total of 10 percent base rent, unless approved by 50 percent plus one of the tenants, with the exception of projects mandated by governmental authorities, as described above. However, the cost of capital improvement projects mandated by governmental authority shall be included in the calculation of the 10 percent of base rent limitation described in this section for purposes of determining whether a capital improvement project not mandated by governmental authority requires approval of the tenants.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 9, 1987.)
8.57.090 - Rent increases—Commission review.
A.
1. In order to implement a rental increase as permitted under Section 8.57.070 of this chapter, the owner must file with the commission a proposed rent schedule on the form provided by the commission. The rent schedule shall show the proposed new maximum rents for each space, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.57.070 of this chapter.
2.
The owner shall serve each affected tenant, either personally or by mail, with notice of the proposed increase, in accordance with state law, and with notice that a request for approval of same is being filed with the commission. The owner shall file proof of such service with the commission concurrent with the filing of the rental increase request. Copies of the rent schedule, request for increase and supporting documentation shall be available free of charge to any tenant requesting same at the owner's office in the affected mobilehome park.
B.
1.
At its next meeting, but no later than 21 days from the date of filing, the commission shall review the rent schedule for completeness, accuracy and compliance with this chapter. If the commission determines that the schedule is complete, accurate and in compliance with this chapter, it shall approve the schedule and the new rents shall become effective as noticed by the owner.
2.
If the commission determines that the proposed rent schedule is not complete, accurate, or in compliance with this chapter, it shall deny the increase without prejudice, based on the deficiency. It shall inform the owner of the deficiencies and take or direct other appropriate action. If the commission approves an increase lower than that originally noticed by the owner, the same shall be effective as of the date noticed by the owner.
C.
If the owner requests an increase above that allowed by the formula set forth in Section 8.57.070 of this chapter, he shall submit with the rent schedule a request for such increase, together with supporting documentation. The notice and proof-of-service requirements set forth in subsection A of this section shall apply to such request.
D.
The commission shall set a hearing on any request complying with the requirements of this chapter no sooner than 10 days and no later than 21 days after receipt of the request and proof of service. The commission shall send written notice to the owner, who shall post such notice in a conspicuous place, of the time and place set for the hearing. If the commission approves an increase as requested, or lower than requested, the same shall take effect as noticed by the owner or as the commission may otherwise direct.
E.
In any application for rent increase under this chapter, the owner shall indicate which, if any, of the mobilehome spaces are covered by leases or contracts which provide for more than a month-to-month tenancy, together with the expiration date of each such lease or contract. Any rent increase approved by the commission under this chapter shall not be applicable to spaces covered by such leases or contracts during the term of such leases or contracts; provided, however, that in acting upon any application for rental increase hereunder, the commission shall set rents in accordance with this chapter for spaces covered by leases or contracts which shall become applicable to such spaces upon the expiration of each such lease or contract subject to the limitations stated in subsection E of Section 8.57.030 of this chapter.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 10, 1987.)
8.57.100 - Review hearings.
A.
All review hearings conducted by the commission shall be open to the public.
B.
All parties to the hearing may have assistance from an attorney or such other person as may be designated by said parties in presenting evidence or in setting forth by argument their position. All witnesses shall be sworn in and all testimony shall be under penalty of perjury.
C.
In the event that either the owner or the tenant(s) should fail to appear at the hearing at the specified time and place, the commission may hear and review such evidence as may be presented and make such decisions as if both parties had been present.
D.
All review hearings shall be tape-recorded. Tapes shall be preserved for six months, or longer, if requested by either party affected by the hearing.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 11, 1987.)
8.57.110 - Standards for evaluating rent increases.
A.
Factors for Consideration. In evaluating the rent increase proposed by the owner, the commission shall consider, along with all relevant factors, changes in costs to the owner attributable to increases or decreases in master land or facilities lease rent, utility rates, property taxes, insurance, advertising, variable mortgage interest rates, governmental assessments and fees, incidental services, employee costs, normal repair and maintenance, and other considerations, including, but not limited to, capital improvements, upgrading and addition of amenities or services, and the level of rent necessary to permit a just and reasonable return on the owner's property.
B.
Presumption of Fair Base Year Net Operating Income. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, it shall be presumed that the base rent adjusted pursuant to Section 8.57.070 of this chapter provided a fair return on property. Owners shall be entitled to maintain and increase their net operating income from year to year in accordance with subsection C.
C.
Rebutting the Presumption. It may be determined that the base rent adjusted pursuant to Section 8.57.070 of this chapter yielded other than a fair return on property, in which case it may be adjusted accordingly. In order to make such a determination, the commission must make at least one of the following findings:
1.
The owner's operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years. In such instances, adjustments may be made in such expenses so the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time. The commission shall consider the following factors:
a.
The owner made substantial capital improvements during 1985, which were not reflected in the rent levels on the base year date,
b.
Substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by natural disaster or vandalism,
c.
Maintenance and repair was below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services, and
d.
Other expenses were unreasonably high or low, notwithstanding the following of prudent business practice. In making this determination, the fact that property taxes prior to 1985 may have been higher than in the base year shall not be considered. It is not the intent of this chapter to reward inefficient business practices;
2.
The rent on the base-year date was disproportionate due to one of the enumerated factors below. In such instances, adjustments may be made in calculating gross rents, consistent with the purposes of this chapter:
a.
The rent on the base-year date was established by a lease or other formal rental agreement which provided for substantially higher rent at other periods during the term of the lease,
b.
The rent on the base-year date was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the year by reason of seasonal demand or seasonal variations in rent, and
c.
The rent on the base-year date was substantially higher or lower than preceding months by reason of premiums being charged or rebates being given for reasons unique to particular units or limited to the period determining the base rent.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 12, 1987.)
8.57.120 - Rent increases—Commission decision authority.
A.
The commission shall make a final decision no later than 10 days after the conclusion of its hearing. The commission's decision shall be based on the preponderance of the evidence at the hearing. All parties to the hearing shall be advised of the commission's decision and given a copy of the findings upon which the decision is based.
B.
Consistent with its findings, the commission may:
1.
Permit the requested increase to become effective, in whole or in part;
2.
Deny the increase; or
3.
If circumstances justify, order a reduction in rent to a rate determined by the commission.
C.
If the commission finds that an increase that went into effect, or any portion thereof, is not justified, the owner shall refund the amount found to be unjustified to the tenant within 60 days after the decision of the commission is announced.
D.
If the commission finds that a proposed increase, or any portion thereof that was previously inoperative, is justified, the tenant shall pay the amount found justified to the owner within 60 days after the decision of the commission is announced.
E.
The conclusions and findings of the commission shall be final and there shall be no appeal rights to the board of supervisors.
F.
Any party disputing the final conclusions and findings of the commission may seek review of the commission's actions pursuant to Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 13, 1987.)
8.57.130 - Hearing—Evidence and procedural irregularities.
Formal rules of evidence or procedure which must be followed in court shall not apply to commission proceedings, except to the extent that the commission shall determine. No action of the commission hereunder shall be held void or invalid or be set aside by any court on the grounds of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or by reason of any error, irregularity, informality, neglect or omission (hereinafter called "error") as to any matter pertaining to applications, notices, findings, records, hearings, reports, recommendations, or any matters of procedure whatever, including but not limited to those included in this section, unless after an examination of the entire case, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of was prejudicial, and that by reason of such error the party complaining or appealing sustained and suffered substantial injury, and that a difficult result would have been probable if such error had not occurred or existed. There shall be no presumption that error is prejudicial or that injury was done if error is shown.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 20, 1987.)
8.57.140 - Fees and administrative assessments.
A.
Administrative Assessments. In order to reimburse the county for the costs of administering and enforcing this rent stabilization program, which benefits and applies only to mobilehome parks and tenants and not to other residents of the county, each owner of a mobilehome park subject to this chapter shall pay a monthly assessment for each space in the park at a rate established by the board of supervisors. These funds paid to the county shall be used solely to administer and implement this chapter. The board shall adjust the amount of this assessment from time to time to reflect actual costs, and may accumulate a reasonable reserve for contingencies.
B.
Fees. The board of supervisors shall set fees to be paid with the applications and requests for review of decisions regarding applicability of this chapter, a CPI formula increase, utility pass-through, change of occupancy, use, or expiration of lease adjustment, or equalization adjustment, and for increases which exceed the formula as set forth in Section 8.57.070.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 23, 1987.)
8.57.150 - Implementation guidelines.
After a noticed public hearing, as it deems necessary, the board of supervisors may adopt by resolution guidelines to aid in the implementation of this chapter.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 22, 1987.)
8.57.160 - Notice to new and prospective tenants.
Prior to or at the time of agreeing to rent space to a new tenant in a mobilehome park, the owner shall provide each new tenant or prospective tenant with a copy of the mobilehome park rent stabilization system ordinance, as currently in force.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 21, 1987.)
8.57.170 - Tenant's right of refusal.
A tenant may refuse to pay any increase in rent which is in violation of this chapter, provided that the commission has either not reached its decision, or has found the increase violates the provisions of this chapter. Such refusal to pay shall be a defense in any action brought to recover possession of a mobilehome space or to collect the rent increase.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 14, 1987.)
8.57.180 - Retaliatory eviction.
Notwithstanding Section 8.57.170 of this chapter, in any action brought to recover possession of a mobilehome space, the court may consider as grounds for denial any violation of any provision of this chapter. Further, the determination that the action was brought in retaliation for the exercise of any rights conferred by this chapter shall be grounds for denial. Any action brought within six months of a petition or complaint filed with the commission by the tenant pursuant to this chapter shall be presumed to be retaliatory; this presumption affects the burden of proof, and is rebuttable by the owner.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 15, 1987.)
8.57.190 - Violation—Civil remedies.
If any owner demands, accepts, receives or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum lawful space rent, as determined under this chapter, then the tenants in such mobilehome park affected by such violation, individually or by class action, may seek relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction for injunctive relief and damages. The prevailing party will recover costs and reasonable attorney's fees as part of any court judgment.
(Ord. 87-0228 §§ 1 (part), 17, 1987.)

A.
Statement of Purpose. The purpose of this section is to require persons to convert, close or cease the use of a mobilehome park to address the impact on the residents to be displaced, and, where required, to take steps to mitigate the adverse impacts on the residents.

General Requirements.
1.
Prior to the conversion of a mobilehome park to another use or closure of a mobilehome park or cessation of use of the land as a mobilehome park, management shall file with the planning director a report on the impact of the conversion, closure or cessation of use (hereinafter "closure") upon the residents of the mobilehome park who will be displaced.
EXCEPTION: This section shall not apply to a conversion of a mobilehome park pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act (Division 2 [commencing with Section 66410] of Title 7 of the Government Code).
2.
No person shall cause or permit the closure of a mobilehome park until the impact report has been approved by the advisory agency, or the board of supervisors upon request for hearing, and the mitigation measures specified have been completed. Approval by the advisory agency shall be effective ten days after such approval is granted.
D.
Procedures.
1.
Time for Filing Impact Report.
a.
If the proposed closure of the park results from a change of use of the park requiring a discretionary local governmental permit or approval for which a hearing is required by law, including but not limited to a change of zone, conditional use, variance or coastal development permit, then the impact report shall not be filed until such discretionary approval has been obtained. The impact report shall be filed with the planning director and served on each resident of the mobilehome park concurrently with service of the six months' notice described in Section 798.56 (f)(2) of the Civil Code.
b.
If the change of use of the park does not require any of the discretionary approvals described in paragraph (a) above, then the impact report shall be filed with the planning director and served on each resident of the mobilehome park concurrently with service of the twelve months' notice described in Section 798.56 (f)(2) of the Civil Code.
EXCEPTION: If either the six months' notice or the twelve months' notice has been served on the residents of the mobilehome park prior to the effective date of this section, then, within ninety days of the effective date of this section, the impact report shall be served on all current residents and on all residents who have left the mobilehome park since those notices were given, and filed with the planning director.
c.
Proof of service of the impact report on the residents of the mobilehome park must be provided to the planning director at the time of filing the impact report.
2.
Impact Report Contents. The impact report shall address the availability of adequate replacement housing in other mobilehome parks and relocation costs for each resident of the mobilehome park. It shall specify the steps to be taken by management to mitigate any adverse impact of the proposed closure on the residents who will be displaced.
In addition, the impact report shall contain such information and mitigation measures as the advisory agency shall deem necessary, as set forth in rules which may be promulgated by the board of supervisors pursuant to this section.
3.
Hearing and Notice. Upon the receipt of an impact report, the planning director shall examine the same and advise management whether it is complete, within 30 days after receipt thereof. When a complete impact report has been filed, it shall be accepted by the planning director and the planning director shall then within 45 days, set a time, date and place for a hearing. At least 15 days prior to the hearing, the planning director shall mail notice to management and the residents of the date, time and place of the hearing. The notice of hearing shall contain a general explanation of the matters to be considered by the advisory agency. The planning director may give such additional notice as he or she deems necessary or desirable.
4.
Findings and Decision. After conclusion of the hearing, the advisory agency shall render its decision. The advisory agency shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the impact report. The advisory agency shall approve the impact report if it finds that the impact report contains the information required pursuant to this section. In approving the impact report, the advisory agency may impose such conditions as it finds necessary to mitigate the adverse impacts on the residents; however, any steps required to be taken by management pursuant to this section shall not exceed the reasonable costs of relocation. Notice of the advisory agency action shall be mailed to management, to all residents and to all persons who have filed written request therefor.
5.
Request for Board Hearing. Management, or any resident of the park shall, upon request, have the right to a hearing before the board of supervisors on the sufficiency of the impact report. The request shall be filed with the planning director on forms provided for that purpose within 10 days after the action of the advisory agency. Such requests shall not be considered as having been filed unless and until the form has been properly completed and all information required by it has been submitted. When an appeal is filed, it shall be accompanied by a fee in an amount determined according to Section 22.60.230. The completed request form and file shall then immediately be transmitted to the executive officer for hearing before the board of supervisors.
The executive officer shall then, within 45 days, set a time and date for a hearing, and shall mail written notice of such hearing to the management, all residents, the person requesting the hearing, the advisory agency and all persons who have filed written request therefor, at least 15 days prior to the hearing.
For all requests for hearing, the board of supervisors may sustain, modify, reject or overrule any recommendations or rulings of the advisory agency and may make such findings as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
6.
Extensions. Any of the time limits specified in this section may be extended by mutual consent of management and the advisory agency, or the board of supervisors, on requests for hearing.
E.
Expiration and Extension of Impact Report. The approval of an impact report shall become null and void after 36 months from the date of the mailing of the final approval of the impact report. Thereafter, management shall not convert, close or cease the use of the park until such time as a new impact report is approved. However, upon application of the management, filed with the advisory agency on or before the date of expiration, the impact report may be extended by the advisory agency up to an additional 36 months. An application for an extension shall be subject to the notice and hearing procedures described in subdivision 3 of subsection (D) of this section.
F.
Revocation and Amendment. Any time prior to the closure of the mobilehome park, the advisory agency may, in its discretion, and upon good cause shown, initiate proceedings for the revocation or amendment of an impact report. Good cause may include, but is not limited to, change of circumstances which render the conditions or requirements of the impact report no longer necessary or appropriate, negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation of fact relating to the impact report, or noncompliance with the conditions of the impact report. Prior to revoking or amending an impact report, the advisory agency shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the procedures set forth in subdivision 3 of subsection (D) of this section. Upon revocation, management shall not convert, close or cease the use of the park until such time as a new impact report is approved. Such revocation or amendment is subject to the same request for hearing as is provided in subdivision 5 of subsection (D) of this section.
G.
Evictions Pending Compliance with Impact Report. Termination of a tenancy of any resident pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.56 or any other provision of law shall not relieve management of its obligation to comply with the conditions or requirements of the impact report applicable to that resident. However, if the termination of tenancy is based on subdivisions (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of Section 798.56 of the Civil Code, the advisory agency, upon request by management, may grant to management extensions of time within which to comply with the conditions of the impact report.
H.
Additional Authority of the Advisory Agency. If, notwithstanding the fact that management has not served a six months' or twelve months' notice on the residents, the advisory agency finds that management is attempting to close or convert a park, then the advisory agency shall require the filing of an impact report.
I.
Exceptions. If the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issues an order requiring closure of the mobilehome park, as part of a valid bankruptcy proceeding, then the provisions of this section shall not be applicable.
J.
Remedies.
1.
The failure of management to comply with this section or with any condition of the impact report shall be defense in any action to terminate tenancy under subdivision (f) of Section 798.56 of the Civil Code.
2.
Violation of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor. In addition, the violation of any valid condition of an impact report imposed by the advisory agency pursuant to this section shall constitute a misdemeanor.
K.
Effective Date. The provisions of this section shall apply to any judgment. Accordingly, any affirmative defenses to an unlawful detainer proceeding created or modified by this section shall apply to any such proceeding not reduced to final judgment as of the effective date of this section.
