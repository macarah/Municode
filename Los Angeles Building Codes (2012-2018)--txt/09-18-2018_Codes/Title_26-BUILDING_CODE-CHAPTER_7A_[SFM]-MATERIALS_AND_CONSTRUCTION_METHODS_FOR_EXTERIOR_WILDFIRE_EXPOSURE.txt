FOUNDATION is concrete or masonry which supports a building, including footings, stem walls, retaining walls, and grade beams.
FOUNDATION EXTENDING IN THE DOWNHILL DIRECTION is a foundation running downhill and approximately perpendicular to the uphill foundation.
HILLSIDE BUILDING is any building or portion thereof constructed on or into a slope steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33.3 percent). If only a portion of the building is supported on or into the slope, these regulations apply to the entire building.

SECONDARY ANCHORS are diaphragm anchors designed for and providing a redundant diaphragm to foundation connection, as described in Sections 1613.8.6 and 1613.8.7.4.
UPHILL DIAPHRAGM EDGE is the edge of the diaphragm adjacent and closest to the highest ground level at the perimeter of the diaphragm.
UPHILL FOUNDATION is the foundation parallel and closest to the uphill diaphragm edge.
