109.1 - General.
No building or structure or portion thereof shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of a building or structure or portion thereof shall be made until the Building Official has approved the building or structure or portion thereof for such use or occupancy as evidenced by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy. A building of Group R-1, R-2, R-2.1, R-3, R-3.1, or R-4 Occupancy, if erected on a site where grading has been performed pursuant to a grading permit issued under provisions of this Code, shall not be occupied, nor shall gas or electric utilities be connected thereto, unless the grading has been completed in accordance with Appendix J or the Building Official has found, should the grading not be so completed, that the site conditions will pose no hazard to health, safety, or welfare of occupants and/or occupants of adjacent properties, and that a temporary certificate of occupancy has been issued.
Approval of a building or structure for use or occupancy (including, but not limited to, final inspection approval and/or issuance of a certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy) shall not be construed as approval of a violation of the provisions of this Code or of other laws and regulations. Approvals presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or of other laws or regulations are not valid. The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke any such approvals or certificates whenever the Building Official determines that the approval or certificate was issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or when it is determined that the building or structure or portion thereof is in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this Code or other laws or regulations. Any certificate of occupancy or temporary certificate of occupancy so issued shall be surrendered upon request of the Building Official.
