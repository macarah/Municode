2.
Involves receipt or acceptance by the employee of any money or other consideration from anyone other than the county for the performance of an act which the employee would be required or expected to render in the regular course of county employment; or
3.
Involves the performance of an act in other than official capacity as a county employee, which act may later be subject directly or indirectly to the control, inspection, review, audit or enforcement of any other county employee; or

Involves such time demands as would render less efficient the employee's performance of assigned county duties; or
5.
Is clearly inconsistent with the operation, function or responsibilities of the department.

1.
Approve the proposed rules as submitted;
2.
Revise the proposed rules and approve them as revised; or
3.
Return the proposed rules to the department for revision and resubmission within 60 days.
In reviewing the proposed rules, the code review panel shall ensure that the rules prohibit only such outside employment, enterprise or activities specifically described in subsection A above or which are otherwise clearly inconsistent with the operation, function or responsibilities of the department.
Within 30 days of approval by the conflict of interest code review panel, the department shall file the rules with the executive office of the board of supervisors. Upon filing with the executive office, the rules shall be deemed adopted and shall be promulgated by the department. The board of supervisors may, at any time, suspend any rule so adopted.
