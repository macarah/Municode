104.2.3.1
Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of or perform any duty imposed by this Code or other applicable law, or whenever the Building Official or an authorized representative has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building, structure or grading, or upon any premises, any condition which makes such building, structure, grading or premises hazardous, unsafe, or dangerous for any reason specified in this Code or other similar law, the Building Official or an authorized representative hereby is authorized to enter such property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and perform any duty imposed upon the Building Official by this Code or other applicable law; provided that (i) if such property is occupied, then the Building Official shall first present proper credentials to the occupant and request entry explaining the reasons therefor; and (ii) if such property is unoccupied, then the Building Official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the property and request entry, explaining the reasons therefor.
If such entry cannot be obtained because the owner or other person having charge or control of the property cannot be found after due diligence or if entry is refused, then the Building Official or an authorized representative shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure lawful entry and inspect the property.
