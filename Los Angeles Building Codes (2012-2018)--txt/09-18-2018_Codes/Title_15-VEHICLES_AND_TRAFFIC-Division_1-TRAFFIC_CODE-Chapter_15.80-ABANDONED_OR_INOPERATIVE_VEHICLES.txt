Chapter 15.80 - ABANDONED OR INOPERATIVE VEHICLES

15.80.010 - Vehicles deemed public nuisance when—Statutory authority.
In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the board of supervisors hereby makes the following findings and declarations:
The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, not including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, or parts thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted in this chapter, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

1.
The vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership; or
2.
The property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof.
B.
Such notice shall contain a statement of the hearing rights of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located and of the owner of the vehicle.
