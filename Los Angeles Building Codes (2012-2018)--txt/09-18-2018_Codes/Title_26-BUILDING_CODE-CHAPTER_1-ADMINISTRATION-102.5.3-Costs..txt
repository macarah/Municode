102.5.3 - Costs.
The costs incurred by actions taken pursuant to Sections 102.5.1 and 102.5.2, including the entire cost of the services rendered by the County, shall be a special assessment against the property upon which the structure stands, or stood. The Building Official shall notify, in writing, all parties concerned of the amount of such assessment resulting from such work. Within five days of the receipt of such notice, any such party concerned may file with the Building Official a written request for a hearing on the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such assessment. Any party concerned who did not receive a notice pursuant to Section 102.2 and who has not had a hearing on the necessity of the demolition, repairs, or other work in such request for hearing also may ask that such necessity be reviewed. The Building Board of Appeals thereupon shall set the matter for hearing; give such party concerned notice thereof as provided in Section 102.4.2; hold such hearing and determine the reasonableness or correctness of the assessment, or both; and if requested, determine the necessity of the demolition, repairs, or other work. The Building Board of Appeals, in writing, shall notify such party concerned of its decision. If the total assessment determined as provided for in this section is not paid in full within 10 days after receipt of such notice from the Building Official or the Building Board of Appeals, as the case may be, the Building Official shall record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder a statement of the total balance still due and a legal description of the property. From the date of such recording, such balance due shall be a special assessment against the parcel.
The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary County taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary County taxes. All the laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of County taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment.
