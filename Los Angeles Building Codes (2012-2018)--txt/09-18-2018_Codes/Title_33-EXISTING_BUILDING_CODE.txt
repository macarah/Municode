101 - TITLE, PURPOSE, AND INTENT
101.1   Title.
Title 33 of the Los Angeles County Code shall be known as the "Existing Building Code," may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as "this Code."
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.2   Purpose.
The purpose of this Code is to establish the minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating the repair, alteration, change of occupancy, addition to, and relocation of existing buildings. Consistent with this purpose, the provisions of this Code are intended to confer a benefit on the community as a whole and are not intended to establish a duty of care toward any particular person.
This Code shall not be construed to hold the County of Los Angeles or any officer, employee, or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection authorized herein, nor by reason of the issuance or non-issuance of any permit authorized herein, nor for any action or omission in connection with the application or enforcement of this Code. By adopting the provisions of this Code, the County does not intend to impose on itself, its employees, or agents any mandatory duties of care toward persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.3   Scope.
The provisions of this Code shall apply to the repair, alteration, change of occupancy, addition to, and relocation of any existing building or structure within the unincorporated territory of the County of Los Angeles and to such work or use by the County of Los Angeles in any incorporated city.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.3.1   Buildings not previously occupied.
A building or portion of a building that has not been previously occupied or used for its intended purpose in accordance with the laws in existence at the time of its completion shall be permitted to comply with the provisions of the laws in existence at the time of its original permit unless such permit has expired. Subsequent permits shall comply with the Building Code or Residential Code, as applicable, for new construction.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.3.2   Buildings previously occupied.
The legal occupancy of any building existing on the date of adoption of this Code shall be permitted to continue without change, except as is specifically covered in this Code, the Fire Code, or as is deemed necessary by the Building Official for the general safety and welfare of the occupants and the public.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.4   Safeguards during construction.
Construction work covered in this Code, including any related demolition, shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 15.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.5   Applicability.
101.5.1   Internal conflict.
Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement of this Code, the specific requirement shall be applicable. Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify different materials, methods of construction, or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.5.2   Other laws.
The provisions of this Code shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state, or federal law.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
101.5.3   Referenced codes and standards.
The codes and standards referenced in this Code shall be considered part of the requirements of this Code to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where differences occur between provisions of this Code and referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this Code shall apply.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 1, 2016.)
302.6   Parapets and appendages.
302.6.1   General compliance.
Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that, as a result of inadequate construction or bracing to resist horizontal forces, an existing parapet or appendage attached to and supported by an exterior wall of a building is likely to become a hazard to life or property in the event of earthquake disturbance, and such parapet or appendage is not an immediate hazard or danger as described in Section 102, the Building Official may provide the owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building where such parapet or other appendage exists, with a written notice specifying the hazards and the inadequacies of the construction or bracing. The owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building shall, within 12 months from the date of such written notice, eliminate the hazard as set forth below. Any person receiving notice as set out in this Section may appeal, in the manner provided by Section 102.4, to the Building Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 2, 2016.)
302.6.2   Wall anchor.
The parapet or appendage shall be removed and the remainder of the wall shall be anchored at the roof line, or it shall be reconstructed so that it will conform structurally as near as it is practicable to do so with the requirements of Chapter 16 of the Building Code, or it shall be otherwise braced and strengthened in a manner satisfactory to the Building Official, so that it will resist a reasonable degree of horizontal forces without becoming dislodged with danger of falling.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 2, 2016.)
302.6.3   Inspection of existing condition.
Where, in the opinion of the Building Official, it is necessary to open a portion of roof, wall, or ceiling of a building in order to determine the structural condition of any parapet or appendage, the Building Official may order the owner to make such opening and the owner shall comply with said order at the owner's sole cost and expense.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 2, 2016.)
302.7   Existing glass.
Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that an existing glass installation, in rooms having an occupant load of more than 100 persons or a means of egress serving an occupant load of more than 100 persons, as determined by Chapter 10 of the Building Code, is likely to become a hazard in the event of accidental human impact as described in Section 2406.4 of the Building Code and such installation does not comply with the provisions for glazing in such locations, the Building Official may provide the owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building where such glazing exists with a written notice of such condition. The owner of the building or other person or agent in control of the building shall, within 90 days after receiving said notice, replace such glass or otherwise cause the installation to conform to the requirements of the Building Code.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 3, 2016.)
A401.2   Scope.
The provisions of this Chapter may be used for voluntary seismic improvements to existing Occupancy Group R buildings of wood construction or portions thereof where the structure has a soft, weak, or open-front wall line, and there exists one or more stories above.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 4, 2016.)
[BS] A403.1   General.
All modifications required by the provisions in this Chapter shall be designed in accordance with the Building Code provisions for new construction, except as modified by this Chapter.
Exception: Buildings for which the prescriptive measures provided in Section A404 apply and are used.
No alteration of the existing lateral force-resisting system or vertical load-carrying system shall reduce the strength or stiffness of the existing structure, unless the altered structure would remain in conformance to the Building Code and this Chapter.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 5, 2016.)
[BS] A404.1   Limitation.
These prescriptive measures shall apply only to two-story buildings and only when deemed appropriate by the Building Official. These prescriptive measures rely on rotation of the second floor diaphragm to distribute the seismic load between the side and rear walls of the ground floor open area. In the absence of an existing floor diaphragm of wood structural panel or diagonal sheathing, a new wood structural panel diaphragm of minimum thickness of ¾ inch (19.1 mm) and with 10d common nails at 6 inches (152 mm) on center shall be applied. A California licensed architect or engineer shall demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Section A404, and shall approve and stamp the construction documents.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 6, 2016.)
[BS] A405.1   New materials.
New materials shall meet the requirements of the Building Code, except where allowed by this Chapter.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 7, 2016.)
[BS] A407.1   Structural observation, testing and inspection.
Structural observation, in accordance with Section 1704.6 of the Building Code, shall be required for all structures in which seismic retrofit is being performed in accordance with this Chapter. Structural observation shall include visual observation of work for conformance to the approved construction documents and confirmation of existing conditions assumed during design.
Structural testing and inspection for new construction materials shall be in accordance with the Building Code, except as modified by this Chapter.
(Ord. 2016-0059 § 8, 2016.)
