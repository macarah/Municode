107.2 - Plan Checking or Review Fees for Buildings or Structures.*
When an application for a building permit is submitted for review, a fee shall be paid to the Building Official. Said fee shall be equal to 85 percent of the building permit fee as set forth in Table 1-A, provided, however, the minimum fee shall be $88.60.
In addition to the aforementioned fees, the Building Official may require additional charges for review required by changes, additions or revisions of approved plans or reports, and for services beyond the first and second check due to changes, omissions or errors on the part of the applicant. The payment of said fees shall not exempt any person from compliance with other provisions of this Code.
The fees specified in this Section are separate fees from the permit fees specified in Section 107.1.
