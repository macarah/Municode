108.1 - General.
All construction or work for which a building permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the Building Official and all such construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the Building Official. In addition, certain types of construction shall have continuous inspection as specified in Chapter 17.
Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this Code or of other laws. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or of other laws shall not be valid.
It shall be the duty of the permit holder to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the Building Official nor the jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to allow inspection.
A survey of the lot may be required by the Building Official to verify compliance of the structure with approved plans.
A site inspection may be required prior to plan check of building plans for lots or parcels in areas having slopes of 5 horizontal to 1 vertical (5:1) or steeper when the Building Official finds that a visual inspection of the site is necessary to establish drainage requirements for the protection of property, existing buildings or the proposed construction. The fee for such inspection shall be as set forth in Section 107.9. Such a preinspection shall not be required for a building pad graded under the provisions of Appendix J.
