107.17 - Annual Review of Fees.
The fees in this Code shall be reviewed annually by the Director of Public Works. Beginning on July 1, 1992, and thereafter on each succeeding July 1, the amount of each fee in this Code shall be adjusted as follows: Calculate the percentage movement between March of the previous year and March of the current year in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers in the Los Angeles, Anaheim and Riverside areas, as published by the United States Government Bureau of Labor Statistics. Adjust each fee by said percentage amount and round off to the nearest 10 cents, provided, however, that no adjustment shall decrease any fee and no fee shall exceed the reasonable cost of providing services. When it is determined that the amount reasonably necessary to recover the cost of providing services is in excess of this adjustment, the Building Official may present fee proposals to the Board of Supervisors for approval.
