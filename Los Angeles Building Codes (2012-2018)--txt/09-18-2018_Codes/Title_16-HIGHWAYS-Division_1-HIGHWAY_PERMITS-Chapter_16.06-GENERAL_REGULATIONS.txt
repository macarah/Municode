The permit shall not be valid until permittee receives a "ticket" number from the system acknowledging the notification, which number permittee shall enter upon the face of the permit. Said notification is an additional method to be used in determining underground facilities, and does not relieve permittee from the responsibility to assure that owners or operators of such facilities are notified. Any permittee shall likewise notify nonmembers of the system who are owners or operators of facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation. Any person receiving notice pursuant to this Division 1 shall, not less than one working day in advance of proposed construction unless otherwise agreed between said person and permittee, inform the permittee of or field mark the location of any underground facility in the proposed area of excavation.

Any permittee, prior to making any excavation within the construction area where a pipeline known to carry a hazardous substance exists, shall not excavate until the pipeline has been located by potholing or other proven acceptable methods at intervals sufficient to determine its exact location. The permittee shall arrange with the owner to locate or expose private and public facilities. Abandoned or inoperative pipelines designed to carry hazardous substances shall be considered as carrying a hazardous substance until determined otherwise by owner.
B.
In no case shall the intervals between potholes or the location by proven acceptable methods exceed the distance set forth as follows:
1.
Excavations for Highway Construction. The pipeline shall be located at intervals not greater than 25 feet for lines less than eight inches in diameter, 50 feet for lines of eight inches through 24 inches in diameter, and 200 feet for lines greater than 24 inches in diameter;
2.
Trench Excavation.
a.
Longitudinal Pipelines. All longitudinal pipelines in the construction area of the highway shall be located at intervals not greater than 500 feet.

b.
Transverse Pipelines. If the location of the pipeline is above or less than six inches below the facility being installed, it shall be carefully hand-tool exposed before excavating. If its location is six inches or more below the facility, it need only be located.
(Ord. 11581 § 3 (part), 1977: Ord. 9349 § 1 (part), 1967: Ord. 3597 Ch. 1 § 139(E), 1940.)

A.
After it is determined that the horizontal or vertical clearance between the pipeline known to carry hazardous substances and the construction limits is less than 12 inches (18 inches if scarifying), the permittee shall confer with the owner. Unless the owner elects to relocate, abandon or take the pipeline out of service, the permittee shall not excavate until the pipeline has been completely hand-tool exposed within the limits of construction.
B.
Once the physical location of pipelines known to carry hazardous substances has been determined, as above described, the permittee doing the excavating, in cooperation with and with the occurrence of the owner, shall determine how to protect the pipeline from damage before proceeding with his work.

16.06.170 - Facilities within highways—Notice when unidentified utilities are located.
Each permittee excavating in the highway shall notify the public agency maintaining records for the jurisdiction and the owner, if known, whenever previously unidentified or unknown utilities or underground facilities are encountered so that the location can be accurately established and made a part of the permanent substructure records.

The permittee violating this section may also be prosecuted under the provisions of Chapter 16.28 of this code.

F.
In those instances where the permittee's excavation is within an area of highway to be reconstructed by the county and the resurfacing of the excavation is an integral part of the general county improvement, the commissioner may waive such resurfacing.
