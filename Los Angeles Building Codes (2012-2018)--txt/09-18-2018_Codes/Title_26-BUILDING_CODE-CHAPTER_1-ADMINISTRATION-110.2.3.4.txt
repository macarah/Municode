110.2.3.4
When the proposed work involves an addition or additions to an existing structure but is not a change in use or occupancy and such work does not increase the gross floor area of the structure by more than 25 percent of the area of the structure as it existed on July 6, 1968, and the Building Official determines that the proposed work will not impact a historically active landslide. Before a permit may be issued pursuant to this Section, the owner shall do all of the following:
1.
Submit an engineering geology and/or soils engineering report or reports that contain(s), at a minimum, a qualitative and/or a conditional finding that the proposed work complies with the provisions of Section 110.2.1.

3.
Record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder an agreement relieving the County and all officers and employees thereof of any liability for any damage or loss which may result from the issuance of such a permit. This agreement shall provide that it is binding on all successors in interest of the owner and shall continue in effect until the Building Official records in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder a statement that the Building Official has determined that a hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage no longer exists.
This Section shall not apply to structures constructed after July 6, 1968.
