Chapter 8.58 - MOBILEHOME PARK TENANT PROTECTIONS

8.58.010 - Retaliatory action.
No mobilehome park owner shall take any form of retaliatory action against a mobilehome park tenant, whose rent was previously subject to the requirements of Section 8.57.070 of the Los Angeles County Code, as a result of lost rents that were in excess of the rents set by the Los Angeles County Adjustment Commission during the term of Ordinance No. 87-0228, codified as Chapter 8.57 of the Los Angeles County Code. Any rent level set for such mobilehome park tenant which is greater than those of comparable mobilehome spaces in the same mobilehome park and any legal action brought by the owner to evict such a tenant that refuses to pay such rent shall be presumed to be retaliatory; this presumption affects the burden of proof and is rebuttable by the mobilehome park owner.
As used in this chapter, "mobilehome park owner" or "owner" means the owner, lessor, operator or manager of a mobilehome park in the county of Los Angeles.
This section shall not apply to any mobilehome park that was exempt at any time from the provisions of Ordinance No. 87-0228 pursuant to Section 8.57.030 of that ordinance.
(Ord. 95-0008U § 1 (part), 1995.)
8.58.020 - Civil remedies.
Mobilehome park tenants which are subject to retaliatory action as specified in Section 8.58.010 may seek injunctive relief and/or damages in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
(Ord. 95-0008U § 1 (part), 1995.)
8.58.030 - Violation—Penalty.
Any person violating any of the provisions, or failing to comply with any of the requirements, of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period of not more than six months or by both. Each violation of any provision of this chapter, and each day during which a violation is committed, permitted or continued, shall constitute a new and separate offense.
(Ord. 95-0008U § 1 (part), 1995.)
