Performance management.
1.
Performance rating categories and process.
The retirement administrator, or his/her designee, shall annually evaluate the performance of each Participant, in accordance with guidelines and in a format established by the LACERA director of human resources, which shall provide for an overall performance rating based on the following five category rating scale:
EXPAND
— "Far Exceeded Expectations"
— "Exceeded Expectations"
— "Met Expectations"
— "Needs Improvement Meeting Expectations"
— "Failed to Meet Expectations"
  The performance management process includes annually setting goals and defining performance expectations developed jointly by the retirement administrator or his/her designee and each Participant. The retirement administrator defines department values for the performance management process. At the discretion of the retirement administrator, Participants on a leave of absence during the rating period are not required to have a performance plan while on an approved leave of absence.
2.
Rating period.
a.
The rating period will be as designated by the retirement administrator. However, the performance of each Participant will be reviewed periodically by the retirement administrator or his/her designee during the performance period. At the conclusion of the rating period, the retirement administrator or his/her designee will review the performance of each Participant and complete an evaluation form in the manner established by the LACERA director of human resources. At the discretion of the retirement administrator, an evaluation form may be completed for those Participants with less than six months service in the Plan. The retirement administrator or his/her designee shall have the option of rating Participants on leave for more than six months of the rating period. Participants on leave for less then six months shall be given an overall performance rating except in the case where the LACERA director of human resources has determined that unusual circumstances exist. Where Participants on a leave of absence are rated, any Tier I Merit Salary Adjustment or Tier II Step Advancement may, at the discretion of the retirement administrator, be granted upon the Participant's return to work. Participants who are not rated shall not be granted a Tier I Merit Salary Adjustment or a Tier II Step Advancement.
b.
In the case of the retirement administrator, the evaluation shall be in accordance with the procedures established by the board of retirement and board of investments jointly.
3.
Performance evaluation timeliness. Tier I Merit Salary Adjustments and/or Tier II Step Advancements will be withheld for both the rater and employee being rated if the performance evaluation has not been submitted on a timely basis in accordance with timeframes established by the LACERA director of human resources or by the retirement administrator or his or her designee. Upon submission of the performance evaluation, the employee being rated will be eligible for a retroactive Tier I Merit Salary Adjustment or Tier II Step Advancement based on his/her performance rating. However, in no case where a performance evaluation was not submitted on a timely basis shall the rater receive a retroactive Tier I Merit Salary Adjustment or Tier II Step Advancement.
4.
Performance rating transition. For Participants previously evaluated under Civil Service Rule 20.04, the last performance evaluation rating under Civil Service Rule 20.04 shall be used for all purposes on or after October 1, 2008 and continuing only until a new performance rating is given under Tier I or Tier II of the Plan. Performance evaluation ratings under Civil Service Rule 20.04 shall be treated as they are the same as Tier I and Tier II Plan ratings as follows:
a.
Permanent Employees.
EXPAND
"Outstanding" = "Far Exceeded Expectations"
"Very Good" = "Exceeded Expectations"
"Competent" = "Met Expectations"
"Improvement Needed" = "Needs Improvement Meeting Expectations"
"Unsatisfactory" = "Failed to Meet Expectations"
  b.
Probationary Employees.

In the case of a disputed individual performance evaluation and rating, the affected Participant shall be afforded full opportunity to present, in writing, his/her request for review and modification of the rating to the Participant's immediate supervisor. Such requests shall be made within 10 business days of receipt of a performance rating. The decision of the supervisor shall be final subject to review and reconsideration as outlined in subsection 2 of this section. In the case of an Assistant Executive Officer, such presentation shall be made to the retirement administrator, whose decision shall be final. In the case of the Chief, Internal Audit, LACERA, such presentation shall be made to the Audit Committee of the Board of Retirement and the Board of Investments, whose decision shall be final.
2.
LACERA Director of Human Resources Review. Within 10 business days of receipt of the decision of the supervisor under subsection 1 of this section, any affected Participant, except an assistant executive officer, may request review by the director of human resources and reconsideration by the supervisor for a performance rating of "Needs Improvement Meeting Expectations" or "Failed to Meet Expectations." The director of human resources shall review the process and submit recommendations to the retirement administrator, who will then render a final decision on the evaluation and rating. The decision of the retirement administrator shall be conclusive.

The retirement administrator shall recommend, as appropriate, and the board of retirement and board of investments jointly may approve General Salary Adjustments for Participants. General Salary Adjustments are adjustments that are across-the-board in nature and that affect the Salary Structure for Tier I and Tier II. General Salary Adjustments, where implemented, are intended to keep pace with external salary inflation and preserve internal pay relationships with other LACERA employees who are not Participants. In recommending a General Salary Adjustment, the retirement administrator shall consider both LACERA's operational needs, including the need to recruit and retain quality personnel under the Plan, and LACERA's ability to pay for the adjustments.
H.
Tier I and Tier II Management Appraisal and Performance Plan basic salary structures.
1.
Reassignment of Positions. The retirement administrator shall recommend to the board of retirement and board of investments reassignment of positions to higher or lower Tier I or Tier II Salary ranges when appropriate as necessitated by external market conditions or changes in the duties and responsibilities of affected positions.
2.
Salary Rate Below the Minimum of the Salary Range. A Participant's salary may fall below the minimum of the Salary range as a result of a Salary Structure adjustment. In such case, there shall be no adjustment in the Participant's salary absent specific authorization and instruction from the board of retirement and board of investments jointly or the retirement administrator. When an employee's salary rate falls below the minimum of the Salary range, it shall not constitute a demotion.
3.
Placement or movement in Salary Range. By specific action, the board of retirement and board of investments jointly or the retirement administrator may provide for salary placement or subsequent movement of an employee at any rate within the established Salary range for the position he/she holds. Movement in the Salary range may result in either an increase or decrease to a Participant's current salary.
4.
Equivalency of Compensation. An employee who is receiving additional compensation pursuant to Section 6.10.070, Section 6.10.073 A and B, Section 6.44.015, Section 6.50.020, or Section 6.64.020 A of this code shall, at the time his or her position is assigned to the Plan, be designated a salary rate on the appropriate Salary range that is not less than his/her then current salary, including such additional compensation.
5.
Change of Status. When a person receives a change of classification, is transferred, or is appointed from an eligible list to a position, such change of status shall not be deemed a promotion or demotion when there is a difference of less than 2.75 percent between the Control Point of the old Salary range and the Control Point of the new Salary range or between the Control Point of the new Salary range and the highest step of a position not designated for the Plan. Said person will be placed within the Salary range at his/her then current salary, or for Tier II, placed on the nearest step that does not result in a decrease in salary for the participant. Where the new position is outside the Plan, the employee's salary step placement shall be determined as otherwise provided by this code.
6.
Reduction of Salary Range. When a person continues to hold a position whose Salary range is reduced or which is reclassified to a lower level, said person will be placed within the new Salary range at his/her current salary, or for Tier II, placed on the nearest step that does not result in a decrease in salary for the participant. If the current salary is higher than the new salary range maximum, said person's rate of pay shall be identified as a Y-Rate, which shall remain until such time as the Y-Rate is within the Salary range for the position.
7.
Appointment to Lower-Level Position. When a person on a higher position is appointed from an eligible list to a lower-level position, or is voluntarily reduced, he/she shall be placed at any salary within the Salary range for the lower-level position or his/her current salary, whichever is less. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 7, a person appointed prior to completion of his/her probationary period on the higher position shall be placed at a salary within the Salary range of the lower position, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.08.345.
8.
Equivalency of Grade. A class in Tier I is deemed to be equal in grade to a class in Tier II if the two Salary Ranges are equal in terms of the minimum and maximum rates as indicated by the numeric designation assigned to the Salary ranges. (A class compensated at LR10 in Tier I is, for example, equal in grade to a class compensated at LS10 in Tier II). A class in Tier I or Tier II is deemed equal in grade to a class paid in accordance with Chapter 6.08, Part 1 of this title if the top step of the class compensated under Part 1 is less than 2.75 percent above or below the Control Point of the Salary range for the Tier I or Tier II class as the case may be.
9.
Exception for Certain Participants. The compensation of any Participant employed in a class or position designated by an item sub other than "A" or "L" pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.28.020 A shall be limited to that provided by this subsection. Such Participant shall be compensated at a salary rate not to exceed the Control Point of the Salary range or at any salary within the Salary range, with the concurrence of the retirement administrator. The salary rate for such Participants shall be adjusted in accordance with the approved General Salary Adjustments provided the retirement administrator certifies such Participant's performance is equivalent to "Met Expectations" or better.
I.
Demotion. Upon demotion of a Participant from a higher-level position to a lower-level position the Participant's Salary shall be determined as follows:
1.
Permanent Status. Any person who has completed the probationary period for the higher-level position and voluntarily demotes to another position on a lower Salary range shall be placed at any salary within the lower Salary range, provided said salary does not exceed the maximum of the new Salary range for the lower-level position or his/her current salary, whichever is less. When a person is involuntarily demoted for discipline or performance reasons, the Appointing Authority may place said person at any place within the Salary range of the lower-level position at a rate not to exceed his/her current salary.
2.
Probationary Status. Any person demoted to another class prior to completion of the probationary period for the higher-level position shall be returned to the salary held prior to the promotion as though the person had never occupied the higher-level position.
3.
Demotion to Position Outside the Plan. Any person demoted to a class not compensated pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.127.040 shall be placed at an appropriate salary in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.08.110 of Part 1 of this code.
