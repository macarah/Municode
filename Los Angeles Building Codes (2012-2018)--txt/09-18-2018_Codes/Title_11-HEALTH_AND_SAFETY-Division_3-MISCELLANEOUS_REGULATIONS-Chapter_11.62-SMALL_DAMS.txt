2.
Any railroad fill or other railroad structure;
3.
Any fill or structure for public highway purposes;
4.
Any dam included in the provisions of Division 3, Part 1 of the California State Water Code;
5.
Any overnight storage reservoir used for the purpose of irrigation, or any small dam situated in an isolated, self-contained area, if the county engineer finds that, by reason of such isolation and self-containment, no danger to private or public property can now or thereafter result from the construction, failure or operation of the structure or appurtenances;
6.
Any dam, under regulations of other public agencies, whose specific duties and obligations are the construction or maintenance of such appurtenances, or are regulated by other Los Angeles County ordinances.
(Ord. 8692 § 2, 1964.)
11.62.030 - Permit—Required for construction, alteration or removal.
A person, firm, or corporation shall not construct, alter or remove, or cause or permit another person to construct, alter or remove a small dam until he first obtains a written permit from the county engineer.
(Ord. 8692 § 3, 1964.)
11.62.040 - Permit—Application—Information required.
A.
To obtain a permit, the owner or his agent shall first file an application in writing with the county engineer on the form provided for that purpose, and shall furnish the following:
1.
Name and address of the property owner, and the name and address of the applicant if the applicant is not the owner;
2.
A legal description of the property where the small dam is to be constructed and a plot plan showing the location;
3.
A map of the drainage area;
4.
Two sets of plans and specifications of the construction proposed, including a plan of the area to be flooded, with accurate contour lines showing the original topography;
5.
Rainfall and runoff data, and computations necessary to determine the amount of water to be expected;
6.
Accurate cross-sections and grade of the outlet channel;

11.
Such other information and data the county engineer finds is necessary to properly evaluate the application.
