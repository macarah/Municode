Division 10 - MOTOR VEHICLE SEIZURE AND FORFEITURE
Chapter 13.80 - ILLEGAL DUMPING

13.80.010 - Findings.
The board of supervisors of the county of Los Angeles has determined that:
— Residents of the county of Los Angeles have complained about the nuisances created in their neighborhoods by vehicles that are used to dump bulky items and potentially hazardous materials in their neighborhoods;
— Illegal dumping activities pose a danger to public health and safety, decrease property values, lower the quality of life, and contribute to urban blight;
— Materials that are illegally dumped create a nesting area for rodents, insects, and other vermin while impacting the proper drainage of runoff, polluting local beaches, and making areas more susceptible to flooding when draining basins become clogged;
— Persons who use their vehicles for illegal dumping create unhealthful conditions and blight in communities, thereby negatively impacting the quality of life of residents and leading to reduction of property values;
— Illegal dumping activities also place an undue burden on the county of Los Angeles, which spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year in cleanup, public education, and enforcement costs;
— In spite of the proactive steps, such as installation of cameras and increased patrol taken by the county of Los Angeles in attempts to curtail illegal dumping, the problem persists; and
— Illegal dumping activities and vehicles used in those activities are a public nuisance and the seizure and forfeiture of vehicles that are used for illegal dumping will abate the nuisances caused by this activity in that the vehicles used for these purposes will no longer be available and furthermore, other persons contemplating engaging in illegal dumping will be deterred from using vehicles for these purposes.

Chapter 13.82 - STREET RACING—MOTOR VEHICLE SEIZURE AND FORFEITURE

13.82.010 - Findings.
The Board of Supervisors of the county of Los Angeles has determined that:
— residents of the county of Los Angeles in both urban and rural areas of the county have complained about the nuisances created in their neighborhoods by vehicles that are used in motor vehicle speed contests and exhibitions of speed;
— persons who use their vehicles for motor vehicle speed contests and exhibitions of speed endanger the lives of residents of the county of Los Angeles, create excessive noise that disturbs the peace and quiet of the county's neighborhoods, threaten the rural aesthetic and cultural resources of officially designated scenic corridors, public parkland, and nationally designated recreation areas used by millions of visitors every year, and often bring increased traffic, crowds, litter, drinking in public, urinating in public, gambling, fights, trespassing, graffiti, vandalism, and blight into the areas where the speed contests and exhibitions of speed occur;
— persons who engage in speed contests and exhibitions of speed frequently make alterations to the vehicles utilized by removing environmental restraints, for example, modifying exhaust systems of the vehicles in order to increase the potential speed of the vehicles, thereby polluting the environment and further endangering residents of the county; and
— speed contests, exhibitions of speed, and the vehicles used in those activities are a public nuisance, and the seizure and forfeiture of such vehicles will abate the nuisances caused by these activities in that the vehicles used for these purposes will no longer be available, and furthermore, other persons contemplating engaging in these activities will be deterred from using vehicles for these purposes.

13.82.050 - Seizure of Vehicle.
A.
An authorized public officer may seize a vehicle subject to forfeiture under this chapter upon the issuance of an order by a court having jurisdiction of the vehicle.

C.
An immediate investigation shall be made by the seizing public agency as to any potential claimant to a seized vehicle whose right, title, interest, or lien is of record in this or any other state or appropriate federal agency. Within two business days of the vehicle's seizure, the public agency shall send a notice of seizure to all potential claimants whose right, title, interest, or lien did not arise subsequent to the date and time of seizure of the vehicle, if that person or entity was not previously given a notice of seizure, and to the district attorney for the county of Los Angeles.
D.
The notice of seizure shall include the following:
1.
The name, address, and telephone number of the agency providing the notice;
2.
Identifying information for the vehicle seized and the authority and reason for the seizure;
3.
A statement that in order to receive their post-seizure hearing, the potential claimant shall request the hearing in person, in writing, or by telephone within ten calendar days of the date of the notice; and

A.
Within 14 days of receipt of the notice of seizure required in Section 13.82.050, the district attorney may pursue the forfeiture of vehicles seized under this chapter, as provided in this section. If the district attorney does not commence forfeiture procedures under this section within that 14-day period, title shall revert to the owner and the seized vehicle shall be returned to the owner. If the seized vehicle is returned to the owner because the district attorney has not commenced forfeiture procedures within said 14-day period, the county of Los Angeles shall reimburse the public agency which seized the vehicle for the costs associated with the towing, storage, and release of that vehicle.
B.
If the district attorney determines that forfeiture of the seized vehicle is warranted, the district attorney shall serve a notice of intended forfeiture upon any person who has an interest in the seized vehicle. The notice shall be served as soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 calendar days of the seizure of the vehicle subject to forfeiture.
C.
The notice of intended forfeiture shall be served as follows:
1.
By personal delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested, upon any person who has an interest in the seized vehicle as determined pursuant to Subsection 13.82.050C.

By leaving a copy at the recipient's dwelling or usual place of abode, in the presence of a competent member of the household and thereafter mailing by first-class mail a copy to the recipient at the address where the copy was left.
3.
If the person entitled to service lives out of state and will not accept certified return receipt mail, then service may be made by first-class mail.
4.

With respect to vehicles described in Subsection B of Section 16.82.060 for which forfeiture is sought and as to which forfeiture is contested, the district attorney shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used as set forth in Section 13.82.030.
E.
Upon proof that the vehicle was used for any of the purposes set forth in Section 13.82.030, the court shall declare the vehicle a nuisance and order that the vehicle be forfeited, sold, and the proceeds distributed as set forth in Section 13.82.080. The court may make a different distribution of the proceeds if the court finds that the claimant did not know that the vehicle was used for a purpose that constitutes a violation of this chapter.

G.
If no claims are timely filed, the district attorney shall prepare a written declaration of forfeiture of the vehicle to the county. A written declaration of forfeiture signed by the district attorney under this section shall be deemed to provide good and sufficient title to the forfeited vehicle. The proceeds from the disposal of the vehicle declared forfeited by the district attorney shall be distributed in accordance with Section 13.82.080. The district attorney ordering forfeiture pursuant to this section shall provide a copy of the declaration of forfeiture to any person who received notice of the forfeiture proceedings.
