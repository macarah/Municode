Before commencing duties, the special inspector shall be examined and shall obtain a certificate of registration from the Building Official. As to the written portion of the required examination, the Building Official may administer a written examination or the Building Official may require that a special inspector applicant successfully complete an examination administered by the International Code Council (ICC). Applications shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied by a fee of $264.70. When the Building Official requires the ICC Certificate in lieu of administering a written examination, the application shall be accompanied by proof of the required Certificate and a fee of $164.50. A separate application and a separate fee shall be required for each type of work, and shall be valid for one year from the application submission date. Requests for refunds shall be made within 30 days of expiration of the application, only for applicants who did not take the exam. Applicants failing to pass an examination shall be ineligible for re-examination for a period of 30 days. Applicants failing to pass an examination for a second time shall be ineligible for re-examination for a period of 180 days, at which time a new application and fee shall accompany the request for re-examination. Unless sooner revoked, certificates of registration for special inspectors shall expire biennially on June 30, and must be renewed by payment of biennial renewal fee of $109.50. Registrations issued from January 1 through June 30 in renewal years shall be valid through June 30 of the successive biennial period.
Upon evidence, satisfactory to the Building Official, of the failure of a special inspector to perform properly and effectively the duties of said office, the Building Official may revoke, suspend or refuse to renew any certificate of registration. Prior to such action, the holder shall be given an opportunity to appear before the Building Official and be heard.
