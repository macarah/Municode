Chapter 1.25 - ADMINISTRATIVE FINES AND NONCOMPLIANCE FEES FOR CODE VIOLATIONS

The purpose of this chapter is to establish alternate remedies for code enforcement officials to utilize in enforcing the provisions of this code. The remedies authorized in this chapter are cumulative to any other remedy provided for in this code or the laws of the state of California, or the United States of America, and the administrative fines and noncompliance fees authorized in this chapter may be imposed in addition to any other fine, penalty, fee, charge, notice of violation, or any other remedy provided for in this code or the laws of the state of California, or the United States of America, so long as the cumulative application of such available remedies would not violate any applicable law.

1.25.080 - Request for administrative hearing/hardship waiver.
A.
Any responsible person served with a notice of administrative fine and/or a notice of noncompliance fee may request an administrative hearing before a hearing officer to contest the imposition and/or the amount of the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee. The request must be made in writing and be filed with the department head within ten (10) calendar days following service of the notice of administrative fine and/or the notice of noncompliance fee and shall include a statement indicating the basis on which the responsible person(s) contests the imposition of the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee, together with any evidence that the responsible person(s) wants the hearing officer to consider. The request shall also include the address of the responsible person(s) for the purpose of correspondence by the department head and/or hearing officer.
B.
The written request for administrative hearing must be accompanied by a deposit equal to the full amount of the administrative fine as specified in the notice of administrative fine, and/or the full amount of the noncompliance fee as specified in the notice of noncompliance fee, unless the responsible person(s) requests a hardship waiver pursuant to subsection C, below. If no such waiver is requested, failure to deposit the amount of the fine and/or fee concurrently with the request for administrative hearing shall constitute a waiver of the responsible person's entitlement to the administrative hearing. The hearing request and fine and/or fee deposit shall be deemed filed on the date received by the department head.
C.
A responsible person who requests an administrative hearing may also request a hardship waiver of the requirement to deposit the amount of the administrative fine and/or noncompliance fee prior to the administrative hearing. A hardship waiver request must be made in writing and filed with the department head and must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit, together with supporting documents or materials, demonstrating the responsible person's financial inability to deposit the amount of the administrative fine and/or noncompliance fee. A hardship waiver request must be filed at the same time as the request for an administrative hearing.
D.
The department head shall review any hardship waiver request and determine, in his or her sole discretion, whether or not to grant any such request and shall provide written notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, of his or her determination to the responsible person(s) at the address contained in the request for administrative hearing. If a request for hardship waiver is granted, the responsible person(s) shall not be required to deposit the amount of the fine and/or fee prior to the administrative hearing. The granting of a hardship waiver shall not excuse the payment of the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee upon a final determination that it is owed. If a request for hardship waiver is denied, the responsible person(s) shall deposit the amount of the administrative fine and/or the amount of the noncompliance fee with the issuing department within ten (10) calendar days following the date of the notice of the department head's determination. Failure to make a timely deposit following the department head's denial of a hardship waiver request shall constitute a waiver of the responsible person's entitlement to an administrative hearing.
E.
After receiving a timely hearing request and deposit or having acted on a timely request for a hardship waiver, pursuant to subsection D of this section, with respect to such deposit, the department head shall schedule an administrative hearing. The responsible person(s) shall be given not less than ten (10) calendar days' prior written notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, of the date, time, and place of the administrative hearing and the name of the hearing officer that will conduct the administrative hearing.
(Ord. 2005-0013 § 1 (part), 2005.)

The request must be made in writing and be received by the hearing officer at least two (2) business days prior to the hearing date. A copy of the continuance request must also be personally served on the enforcement officer if made by the responsible person(s), and on the responsible person(s) if made by the enforcement officer. In no event shall the continuance be longer than forty-five (45) calendar days from the originally scheduled hearing date.
B.
At the hearing, the responsible person(s) shall have the opportunity to present evidence relevant to the hearing officer's determination of the matter. The failure of the responsible person(s) to appear at the administrative hearing shall constitute an abandonment of the hearing request and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies to judicially challenge the imposition of the administrative fine and/or the imposition of the noncompliance fee. If the administrative hearing is abandoned, the issuing department shall keep the funds deposited with the hearing request, unless a hardship waiver was granted, in which case the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee shall be due and payable by the responsible person(s) to the issuing department within ten (10) calendar days following the date that had been set for the administrative hearing.
C.
The notice of violation, notice of administrative fine, and/or notice of noncompliance fee, and any other reports prepared by or for the enforcement officer concerning the code violation, shall be accepted by the hearing officer as prima facie evidence of the code violation and the facts stated in those documents. The enforcement officer may attend the hearing but is not required to do so. Once begun, the hearing officer may continue the hearing from time to time, in his or her sole discretion, to allow for the orderly completion thereof.
D.
After receiving all of the evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer may further continue the hearing and request additional information from either the enforcement officer or the responsible person(s), or may close the hearing.
E.
After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at the hearing and within ten (10) calendar days after the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision to either confirm or cancel the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee or to reduce the amount of the administrative fine and/or noncompliance fee. The written decision shall include a statement of the reasons for the decision. The written decision shall be served by first-class mail, postage prepaid on the responsible person(s) and the enforcement officer. The hearing officer's written decision shall constitute the final administrative decision of the county.
F.
If the hearing officer confirms the imposition of the full amount of the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee, the issuing department shall keep the funds deposited with the hearing request, unless a hardship waiver was granted. If a hardship waiver was granted, the responsible person(s) shall pay the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee to the issuing department within twenty (20) calendar days following the date of the hearing officer's written decision.
G.
If the hearing officer reduces the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee, the issuing department shall refund the appropriate amount of the funds deposited with the hearing request to the responsible person(s) within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of the written decision, unless a hardship waiver was granted, in which case the responsible person(s) shall pay the reduced amount(s) to the issuing department within twenty (20) calendar days following the date of the hearing officer's written decision.
H.
If the hearing officer cancels the administrative fine and/or the noncompliance fee, the issuing department shall refund the entire amount of the funds deposited with the hearing request to the responsible person(s) within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of the written decision, unless a hardship waiver was granted, in which case no further action is necessary.
(Ord. 2005-0013 § 1 (part), 2005.)
1.25.100 - Right to judicial review of final administrative decision to impose administrative fines.
A.
A responsible person(s) may seek judicial review of the hearing officer's written decision pertaining to the imposition of an administrative fine by filing an appeal with the superior court in accordance with the time periods, procedures, and other requirements set forth in section 53069.4 of the California Government Code.
B.
If no appeal of the hearing officer's written decision is filed within the time period set forth in section 53069.4 of the California Government Code, the hearing officer's decision shall be deemed confirmed.
(Ord. 2005-0013 § 1 (part), 2005.)
1.25.110 - Creation of lien for unpaid administrative fines.
A.
In addition to any other remedy provided by law, if an administrative fine is not paid within the time period provided for in this chapter, and the underlying violation pertains to the condition of real property owned in whole or in part by the responsible person(s), the amount of the unpaid administrative fine shall become a lien on that real property and the issuing department may enforce and collect the unpaid administrative fine by recording a notice of lien against that real property in the office of the registrar-recorder/county clerk.
B.
When a notice of lien has been recorded, and the full amount of the corresponding administrative fine is subsequently paid to the issuing department, the issuing department shall promptly record a notice of satisfaction of lien. Upon recordation of the notice of satisfaction of lien, the lien shall be cancelled.
