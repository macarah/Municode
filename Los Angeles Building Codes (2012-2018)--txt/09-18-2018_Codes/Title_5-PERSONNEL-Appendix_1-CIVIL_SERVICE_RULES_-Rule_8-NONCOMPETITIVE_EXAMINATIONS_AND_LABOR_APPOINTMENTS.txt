Rules:

8.01 - Noncompetitive examinations.
A.
The director of personnel may authorize noncompetitive examinations in the county institutions when competition is found to be impracticable.
B.
Competition is impracticable when the number of vacant positions generally exceeds the number of applicants.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
8.02 - Procedure for noncompetitive examinations.
The director of personnel shall order the examination and give notice in the same manner as for a competitive examination. All such examinations shall be open. The examination shall be intended merely to qualify applicants. Successful applicants shall be placed on an eligible list, without indication of relative standing in the examination. An eligible list shall be in effect when approved by the director of personnel. No formal certification will be necessary. The appointing power may appoint any one of the names on the appropriate list, except that a person without veteran's credit may not be appointed if there are three more names on the list of persons entitled to veteran's credit. Each noncompetitive eligible list shall be in effect for the same period of time and may be extended or terminated the same as a competitive eligible list, except that a noncompetitive examination eligible list may also be terminated by the director of personnel when the director finds that a competitive examination is warranted for the position or class.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
8.03 - Labor appointments.
The director of personnel may authorize the appointment of unskilled laborers and such skilled laborers as needed without formal examination, but after such tests of fitness as the director may prescribe.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
8.04 - Procedure for making labor appointments.
Such appointments must be made in order of priority of application excluding such persons as fail the test of fitness prescribed by the director of personnel.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
8.05 - Applicability of other rules.
Rule 7 and 10 do not apply to noncompetitive examinations or labor appointments. All other rules shall apply except insofar as they are in conflict with the provisions of this Rule.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
8.06 - Review and appeals.
Any person who is adversely affected by any action in violation of Rule 8 may request the director of personnel to review such action. Such request for review by the director of personnel shall be made in writing within 10 business days of notification of such action. Such written request for review shall name the specific act complained of and state the reasons for the complaint and the remedy requested. Except as otherwise provided in these Rules, the decision of the director of personnel is final, subject to such judicial review as provided by law for decisions of local administrative agencies.
