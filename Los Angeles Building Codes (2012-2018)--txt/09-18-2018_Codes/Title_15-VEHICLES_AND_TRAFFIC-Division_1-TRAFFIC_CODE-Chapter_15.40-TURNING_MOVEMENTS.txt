15.40.010 - Turning markers or signs—Placement conditions.
A.
Whenever the board or commissioner finds and determines that in order to facilitate the movement of traffic at any intersection that vehicles should take a different course than that specified in Section 22100 of the State Vehicle Code, or that right or left-hand turns should be made from more than one lane, or that vehicles in certain lanes should be required to turn left or right, the commissioners shall place at such an intersection buttons, signs or markers so indicating, pursuant to Section 22101 of the State Vehicle Code.
B.
At those intersections where the commissioner has placed buttons, signs or markers requiring right or left-hand turns, no driver shall drive a vehicle other than as directed and required or permitted by such markers, buttons or signs.

15.40.020 - Turn restrictions—Near channelization devices.
At locations where channelization devices have been placed and the road commissioner finds that it is necessary to prohibit left turns or right turns for the purpose of diminishing the hazard of collision, he shall place appropriate signs prohibiting such left or right turns.
(Ord. 6544 Ch. 2 Art. 3 § 2301, 1954.)
15.40.030 - Turn restrictions—Other intersections.
At all other locations at which the board has determined and found that the elimination of left turns or right turns is necessary to reduce traffic congestion or to diminish the hazard of collision, the road commissioner shall place appropriate signs prohibiting such left or right turns.

15.40.040 - Turn against stop signal—Restrictions.
When appropriate signs have been erected pursuant to Section 21453 of the Vehicle Code, the driver of a vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "STOP" signal shall not make a right turn against such red or "STOP" signal at any approach to any intersection when the board has determined that such turns at such location would interfere with the safe and orderly movement of traffic.
(Ord. 7843 § 2 (part), 1960: Ord. 6544 Ch. 2 Art. 3 § 2303, 1954.)
15.40.050 - Turning around prohibited when.
If the board finds that the volume of traffic, the width of the highway, and other traffic conditions at any intersection are such that the making of a U turn at such intersection would create a traffic hazard, the commissioner shall erect and maintain in a conspicuous place or places at such intersection an adequate sign or signs stating that such U turns are prohibited.
(Ord. 6544 Ch. 2 Art. 3 § 2304, 1954.)
