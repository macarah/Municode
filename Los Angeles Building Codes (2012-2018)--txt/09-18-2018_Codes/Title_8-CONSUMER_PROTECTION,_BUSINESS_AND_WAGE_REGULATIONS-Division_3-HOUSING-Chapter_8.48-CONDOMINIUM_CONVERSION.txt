Chapter 8.48 - CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION

8.48.010 - Purpose—Declaration of urgency.
There has been a dramatic acceleration in the number of condominium, cooperative or community apartment conversion projects. The results of such conversions are causing deleterious effects upon large segments of the population, particularly those in low to moderate income categories. Such conversions cause displacement of renters and decrease housing opportunities for senior citizens, the handicapped and low and moderate income families, create a tighter rental market, cause increased rent, and increase the potential of homelessness for displaced people. Such conditions are having a detrimental effect on the lives of a substantial number of residents of the unincorporated areas of the county.

The deposits required by this section shall be deposited within 10 days after the agreement to purchase has been executed, or within 10 days after the expiration of the 18-month period, whichever is applicable.

In the event the county housing authority uses such funds to subsidize a private development, the authority shall require the developer to execute a covenant and agreement that the project shall be restricted to low-income household apartment use, special-needs housing, transitional housing, use as a homeless shelter or such other housing which serves low-income households for a minimum time period of 20 years.

The hearing officer shall, within 30 days, determine whether the applicant has complied with the covenants and agreements, and notify the county engineer of his findings. The hearing officer's fee shall be borne by the subdivider. The county engineer shall collect said fee from the applicant prior to recommending approval of the final map. The county engineer shall not recommend approval of the final map until notified by the hearing officer that all covenants and agreements have been complied with.
