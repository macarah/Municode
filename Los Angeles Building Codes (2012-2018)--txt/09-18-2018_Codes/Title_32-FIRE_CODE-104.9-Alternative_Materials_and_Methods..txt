104.9 - Alternative Materials and Methods.
The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code, provided that any such alternative has been approved. The fire code official is authorized to approve an alternative material or method of construction where the fire code official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. Requests for approval to use an alternate material, assembly of materials, equipment, method of construction, method of installation of equipment or means of protection shall be made in writing to the fire marshal by the owner or the owner's authorized representative and shall be accompanied by a justification that is supported by evidence to substantiate any claim being made regarding the requested alternative and its compliance with the intent of this code. The fire marshal may require independent tests be performed by an approved testing organization in order to substantiate the proposed alternative.
Approval of a request for use of an alternative material, assembly of materials, equipment, method of construction, method of installation of equipment or means of protection made pursuant to these provisions shall be limited to the particular case covered by the request and shall not be construed as establishing any precedent for any future request. Where the alternative material, design or method of construction is not approved, the fire code official shall respond in writing, stating the reasons why the alternative was not approved.
