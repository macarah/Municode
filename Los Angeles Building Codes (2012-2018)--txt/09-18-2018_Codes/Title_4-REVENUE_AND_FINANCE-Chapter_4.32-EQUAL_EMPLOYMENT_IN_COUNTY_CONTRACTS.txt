Chapter 4.32 - EQUAL EMPLOYMENT IN COUNTY CONTRACTS

4.32.010 - Antidiscrimination provisions required in all contracts and agreements.
Every contract or agreement between the county of Los Angeles and any independent contractor, supplier or vendor shall contain provisions substantially as follows:
A.
The contractor, supplier or vendor certifies and agrees that all persons employed by such firm, its affiliates, subsidiaries or holding companies, are and will be treated equally by the firm without regard to or because of race, religion, ancestry, national origin or sex, and in compliance with all antidiscrimination laws of the United States of America and the state of California.
B.
The independent contractor, supplier or vendor certifies and agrees that it will deal with its subcontractors, bidders or vendors without regard to or because of race, religion, ancestry, national origin or sex.
C.
The contractor or vendor shall allow the county access to its employment records during regular business hours to verify compliance with these provisions when so requested by the county.
D.
If the county finds that any of the above provisions has been violated, the same shall constitute a material breach of contract upon which the county may determine to cancel, terminate, or suspend the contract. While the county reserves the right to determine independently that the antidiscrimination provisions of the contract have been violated, in addition, a determination by the California Fair Employment Practices Commission or the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the vendor or contractor has violated state or federal antidiscrimination laws shall constitute a finding by the county of Los Angeles that the vendor or contractor has violated the antidiscrimination provisions of the contract.
E.
The parties agree that in the event the independent supplier, vendor or contractor violates the antidiscrimination provisions of the contract, the county shall, at its option, be entitled to a sum to be determined prior to execution of the contract pursuant to Civil Code Section 1671 as damages in lieu of cancelling, terminating or suspending the contract.
