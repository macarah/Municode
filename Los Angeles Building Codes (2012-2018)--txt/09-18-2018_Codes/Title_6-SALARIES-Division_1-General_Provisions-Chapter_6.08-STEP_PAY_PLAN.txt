In those positions for which compensation is indicated in Section 6.28.050 by a schedule and level number on the Standardized Salary Schedule, the following general rules shall apply:
A.
Original appointment to these positions shall be at the rate designated as the first step, except in the case of transfer, demotion, or promotion.
B.
Except as provided otherwise in this section, step advances shall be granted upon completion of one year of continuous service in the same position until the top step is reached.
C.
1.
Non-represented employees holding positions compensated at or below the salary schedules indicated below shall be advanced to the second step of the salary range upon completion of six months of continuous service.
EXPAND
Schedule 66B, effective October 1, 2015
Schedule 67C, effective October 1, 2016
Schedule 67L, effective October 1, 2017
Schedule 68H, effective April 1, 2018
  2.
Represented employees holding positions compensated at or below the salary schedules indicated in Section 6.08.010, subsection C.1., as of the effective dates noted in their respective Memoranda of Understanding shall be advanced to the second step of the salary range upon completion of six months of continuous service.
D.
By specific action, the chief executive officer may approve step placement of an employee at any step within the established salary range for the position which he holds, provided that placements made pursuant to this section are reported to the board on a periodic basis. The chief executive officer may, in writing, delegate to an appointing authority the power to make such special step placements. Revocation of such delegation must be in writing. The succeeding step advancement in such a case will be made thereafter on a yearly basis unless an exception is specifically authorized.
E.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title 6, a person for whom an "unsatisfactory" or "improvement needed" performance evaluation has been filed with the director of personnel shall not be granted a step advancement in the position held when such rating was given until a "competent" or better rating is filed.
F.
Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, an employee shall not receive an annual step advance unless he has received a "competent" or better performance evaluation within the immediately preceding year, or has, as the resolution of a grievance, and for purposes of salary-step advancement only, been deemed "competent" by the director of personnel. The effective date of any step advance shall be determined as follows:
1.
An employee who is rated and/or deemed "competent" or better shall be granted a step advance on his step anniversary date.
2.
An employee who is rated "unsatisfactory" or "improvement needed" and, as a result, denied a step advance pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, and is subsequently rated "competent" or better shall be granted a step advance effective on the date said rating of "competent" or better is given. The granting of said step advance shall not set a new anniversary date.

6.08.020 - Base rate in determining step placement.
Base rates are those rates set forth in Section 6.28.050, without respect to Notes or other special pay provisions, such as those contained in Division 2 or 3 of this Title 6, unless such special provisions specifically state that they constitute a base rate. Base rates are the rates used to determine an employee's step placement when applying the provisions of this Chapter 6.08 Step Pay Plan.
(Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 87, 1953.)
6.08.040 - Special step placement conditions.
A.
If a person holds a position which is reclassified to a lower level and continues to hold the lower-level position, or if the salary schedule and level of a position is reduced, persons employed on such positions shall continue to receive the same salary received immediately prior to the reclassification or salary schedule and level reduction. If the salary rate of such a person received immediately prior to the reclassification or salary schedule and level reduction is less than the fifth step rate of the positions as reclassified or the reduced salary schedule and level, he shall retain his anniversary date and be entitled to further step advancement.
B.
Subject to subsection A of this section, a person whose rate of compensation is changed from a flat-rate basis to a five-step basis shall be entitled to compensation at a step rate to which his length of service in that position would normally entitle him.
C.
If an employee, because of a change of status, does not receive a step advance or proper step placement to which he is entitled by length of service, or would receive a reduction in salary which is not merited under the circumstances, such employee may receive special step placement or a Y Rate to provide the proper salary, if such special step placement or Y Rate is approved, after investigation, by the chief administrative officer. If the chief administrative officer finds at any time that the circumstances which supported his original approval no longer exist, he may discontinue the special step placement or Y Rate.
D.
The board may authorize special step placement for any person who is appointed to a position under any of the following conditions:
1.
When the person, immediately prior to his appointment, has been employed by another public or a private agency and is employed by a public entity because the functions in which he was employed in such public or private agency are taken over and assumed by the public entity;
2.
When a position in a public entity is abolished and an employee thereby displaced is qualified to fill and is appointed to another position in the service of another public entity.
(Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 73, 1953.)
6.08.050 - Special Y Rates.
A "Y Rate" is a special salary rate established by a provision of this Title 6 which entitles a person to receive compensation at a rate higher than that provided for in the top step, monthly flat rate, per annum, daily, or hourly rate for the position which he holds.
(Ord. 2015-0063 § 23, 2015: Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 72, 1953.)
6.08.060 - Adjustments in length of salary ranges.
When the length of the salary range of a classification as set forth in Section 6.28.050 is changed by the addition, deletion or change of a Note in Section 6.28.050, the following rules shall apply:
A.
When the range is shortened, each person holding such position shall retain the step in the new range that he was entitled to in the former range.
B.
When the range is lengthened, each person holding such position shall retain his rate in the former range and benefit by the increase in salary schedule and level, if any, provided by Section 6.28.050, and shall retain his step advancement as if said range had not been lengthened.
(Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 74, 1953.)
6.08.070 - Adjusted anniversary dates for step advancement.
A.
Where a person's yearly anniversary date is between the first and the 15th of the month, inclusive, his first step advancement shall be made on the first of that month, and where the anniversary date is on or after the 16th of the month, the step advancement shall be made on the first of the following month. Such persons shall then retain these new dates as their respective anniversary dates.
B.
Effective with the pay period ending April 15, 2012 and upon notification to the board of supervisors by the chief executive officer that the human resources management system implementing this provision is fully operational, the first step advancement for all persons newly appointed to a position shall be made one year from the date of the appointment unless otherwise specified by this Code. Those persons with adjusted anniversary dates according to rules in effect prior to system implementation in 2012 shall retain their adjusted anniversary date for that position.
(Ord. 2012-0017 § 12, 2012; Ord. 2010-0014, § 38, 2010; Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art 5 § 75, 1953.)
6.08.080 - Interdepartmental transfers.
A.
When a person is transferred, he shall be entitled to the same rate of compensation as he would have received had he not been transferred.
B.
Any person receiving compensation at a Y Rate may retain such Y Rate after transfer, promotion, only if the chief administrative officer finds after investigation that retention of such Y Rate is consistent with the reasons for which it was originally authorized.
C.
When a person compensated on a monthly basis changes from a position in one department of the county to a position in another department, and a Saturday, Sunday or holiday intervenes between the time of finishing work in one department and starting in another, he shall be compensated for these days by the department he is leaving at the rate paid in the position he is leaving.
D.
When a person is transferred, any unused current or deferred vacation, accumulated overtime, accumulated holiday time, or accumulated sick leave to which he may be entitled at the time of transfer shall be transferred in whole to the department to which he is transferred. Payment for such accumulated overtime and vacation may be made in a lump-sum payment if specifically authorized by the chief administrative officer. This subsection D shall not apply to persons appointed to any position paid as a county officer pursuant to Section 6.28.020 of this code. When a person appointed by the board of supervisors to such position prior to July 19, 1994, ceases to hold such position, he shall have restored to him benefits to which he was entitled prior to such appointment, less any time chargeable to such benefits had such office not been subject to Item L of Section 6.28.020. A person who has held such a position for five or more years shall not receive compensation upon termination for benefits restored under this paragraph. A person who has held such a position for less than five years shall be entitled to compensation upon Separation from Service for unused restored benefits, less one day of such benefits for each month served as a county officer. Payments pursuant to this subsection D to persons holding office subject to Item L of Section 6.28.020 shall be in lieu of payments pursuant to subsection C of Section 6.18.070, except payments made by reference to subsection A of Section 6.18.070; provided further, that such persons may elect to be paid either the amount specified in this subsection D or that specified in Section 6.18.070C, whichever is greater, but in no event to exceed the maximum amount payable pursuant to Section 6.18.070C. Any person appointed by the board of supervisors or elected on or after July 19, 1994, to a position paid as a county officer, shall be paid upon termination from county service for benefits accrued prior to such appointment or election which would, as provided in Titles 5 and 6 of this code, be paid upon termination from county service if such appointment or election had not occurred. Any such payment shall be calculated at the rate of pay in effect immediately prior to appointment or election to such position.
1.
With regard to any person appointed or elected to a position paid as a county officer on and after January 1, 2005, the term "termination from county service" as used in this section 6.08.080D shall mean a Separation from Service as defined herein.
2.
Payments made pursuant to this section 6.08.080.D upon a Separation from Service shall be made on or before the 30th day following the employee's Separation from Service.
3.
For purposes of this section 6.08.080.D., Separation from Service occurs when the employee terminates employment (including a termination from employment due to death or retirement) with the county (and any other public entity of which the Los Angeles County board of supervisors is the governing body).
a.
A termination of employment will have occurred only if the county and employee reasonably anticipate that the level of bona fide services to be performed by the employee after that date (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more than 49% of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately preceding testing period. For these purposes, the testing period is the preceding 36-month period or the full period of services to the county if the employee has been providing services for less than 36 months.
b.
A termination of employment does not occur while the employee is on a Bona Fide Leave of Absence (as defined herein) if the period of such leave does not exceed 6 months or, if longer, so long as the individual retains a right to reemployment with the county under applicable statute, ordinance or contract. A Bona Fide Leave of Absence includes military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence under applicable rules, provided that there is a reasonable expectation that the employee will return to perform services for the county. If the Bona Fide Leave of Absence exceeds 6 months and the individual does not retain a right to reemployment under applicable statute, ordinance or contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately following that 6-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Bona Fide Leave of Absence is due to any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six months, and where the impairment causes the employee to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar position of employment, a period of 29 months is substituted for the 6-month period otherwise applicable under this provision.
c.
For purposes of section 6.08.080.D.3.a., for periods during which an employee is on a Bona Fide Leave of Absence (as defined in section 6.08.080.D.3.b.) and has not otherwise terminated employment, the employee is treated as providing bona fide services at a level equal to the level of services that the employee would have been required to perform to receive the compensation paid during that Bona Fide Leave of Absence. Periods during which the employee is on an unpaid Bona Fide Leave of Absence are disregarded for the purposes of section 6.08.080.D.3.a.
(Ord. 2008-0071 § 12, 2008; Ord. 94-0080 § 1, 1994: Ord. 94-0063 § 1, 1994: Ord. 94-0053 § 1, 1994: Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 76, 1953.)
6.08.081 - Consolidation of departments.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title 6, whenever any person in a position paid as a county officer pursuant to Section 6.28.020 ceases to hold such position and is appointed to a position other than one paid as a county officer, due to a departmental consolidation plan approved by the board of supervisors, he shall, upon such appointment, have restored to him those sick leave and vacation benefits to which he had been entitled immediately prior to his appointment as a county officer. Upon termination such person shall be entitled to payment for accrued benefits as provided for other county employees except that if termination is within two years of such appointment, the person shall be paid the benefits provided in Section 6.18.070C as though he were still a county officer, or the benefits provided for under this section, whichever is greater. In addition to salary, "pay" as used in subsection C of Section 6.18.070 shall include amounts equivalent to those amounts described in Sections 5.12.200, 5.26.110, 5.27.040A, 5.27.240A, 5.40.460 and 5.40.465 of this code, any professional development allowance, and such other compensation as may be designated from time to time by the chief administrative officer, so long as such determination is related to the base salary compensation used for retirement benefit purposes.
(Ord. 91-0044 § 8, 1991: Ord. 84-0190 § 1, 1984.)
6.08.090 - Appointments to higher-level positions.
A.
For purposes of this section, a promotion is an appointment of an employee with at least six months' active service from a lower-level position:
1.
To a higher-level position from a promotional examination; or
2.
Along established promotional lines; or
3.
To a closely related higher-level position. The director of personnel shall determine if the positions are "closely related" or if the appointment is "along established promotional lines," as these phrases are used in this section.
B.
When a person is promoted, he shall be entitled to receive the step rate in the salary schedule of the new position which provides an increase in salary. A person who is compensated at a Y Rate which exceeds the top step of the salary range of his old position shall, upon promotion, be compensated at the step rate in the salary schedule of the new position which provides an increase in salary over the top step of the old position, provided that he shall not thereby suffer a reduction in salary.
C.
1.
When the increase in salary provided for in subsection B of this section is less than the equivalent of a one-schedule increase in salary, the person shall be placed on the next higher step of the position to which he is appointed. Step advances thereafter shall be as otherwise provided.
2.
Effective with the pay period ending April 15, 2012 and upon notification to the board of supervisors by the chief executive officer that the human resources management system implementing this provision is fully operational, when the increase in salary provided for in subsection B of this section is less than the equivalent of a 2.7846 percent increase in salary, the person shall be placed on the next higher step of the position to which he is appointed. Step advances thereafter shall be as otherwise provided.
D.
1.
When the increase in salary provided for in subsection B of this section is at least equivalent to a one-schedule increase in salary, but less than the equivalent of a two-schedule increase in salary, the person shall be entitled to advance to the next higher step of the position to which he was appointed in one-half of the time otherwise required. Step advances thereafter shall be as otherwise provided.
2.
Effective with the pay period ending April 15, 2012 and upon notification to the board of supervisors by the chief executive officer that the human resources management system implementing this provision is fully operational, when the increase in salary provided for in subsection B of this section is at least equivalent to a 2.7846 percent increase in salary, but less than the equivalent of a 5.6468 percent increase in salary, the person shall be entitled to advance to the next higher step of the position to which he was appointed in one-half of the time otherwise required. For recurrent positions where the increase provided for in subsection B is at least equivalent to a 2.7846 percent increase in salary, but less than the equivalent of a 5.6468 percent increase in salary, such persons shall be entitled to advance to the next higher step upon completion of 50 days (400 hours) of active service. Step advances thereafter shall be as otherwise provided.
E.
When a person is appointed from a lower-level position to a higher-level position and such appointment does not meet the criteria established in subsection A of this section, he may be appointed to any step within the range of the position to which he is appointed not to exceed the salary rate he would have received had the appointment met the criteria of subsection A of this section.
F.
The effective date of any change of status pursuant to this section shall set a new anniversary date.
(Ord. 2014-0005 § 6, 2014; Ord. 2012-0017 § 13, 2012; Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 77, 1953.)
6.08.100 - Appointments to equal-level positions.
When an employee is administratively reassigned pursuant to the Civil Service Rules or is appointed from an eligible list to a position and such appointment results in no increase or decrease in grade as defined by Civil Service Rules, he shall receive salary step placement as follows:
A.
1.
If the salary range of the new position is either the same as that of the previous position, or less than one full schedule below that of the previous position, an employee may be placed at any step within the range of the position to which he is appointed, not to exceed the step rate he held in his former position. Such appointment shall not set a new anniversary date.
2.
Effective with the pay period ending April 15, 2012 and upon notification to the board of supervisors by the chief executive officer that the human resources management system implementing this provision is fully operational, if the salary range of the new position is either the same as that of the previous position or less than 2.7846 percent below that of the previous position, an employee may be placed at any step within the range of the position to which he is appointed, not to exceed the step rate he held in his former position. Such appointment shall not set a new anniversary date.
B.
1.
If the salary range of the new position is less than one full schedule above the salary range of the previous position, an employee may be placed at any step within the new range, provided that he is not placed at any step rate which is higher than the lowest step rate which provides an increase in pay. Such step placement shall not set a new anniversary date.
2.
Effective with the pay period ending April 15, 2012 and upon notification to the board of supervisors by the chief executive officer that the human resources management system implementing this provision is fully operational, if the salary range of the new position is less than 2.7846 percent above the salary range of the previous position, an employee may be placed at any step within the new range, provided that he is not placed at any step rate which is higher than the lowest step rate which provides an increase in pay. Such step placement shall not set a new anniversary date.
(Ord. 2012-0017 § 14, 2012; Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 77-5, 1953.)
6.08.110 - Appointments to lower-level positions.
A.
For purposes of this section, "demotion" means reduction from a higher to a lower level position with the consent of the appointing authority, and without examination.
B.
When any person is voluntarily demoted from a position in which he has completed his probationary period, he shall be entitled to the highest existing step of the salary range of the position to which he is demoted that does not exceed his rate of pay immediately prior to the demotion.
C.
When any person is involuntarily demoted for disciplinary or performance reasons from a position in which he has completed his probationary period, the department head may place him on any step in the range of the lower position, which shall not be higher than the step rate held by the employee in the higher position.
D.
Upon demotion, a person shall retain the anniversary date held in the higher position, except as provided in subsection E of this section.
E.
If a person is voluntarily or involuntarily demoted from a position in which he has not completed his probationary period, the step rate of the position to which he is demoted shall be set as though he had never occupied the higher-level position. In this case, a person demoted to a former position shall have his former anniversary date in that position restored. A person demoted during a probationary period to a position not previously held by him shall be entitled to have the date of entry into the higher-level positions as his anniversary date.
F.
When a person on a higher-level position is appointed from an eligible list to a lower-level position, he may be appointed to any existing step within the range of the position to which he is appointed, not to exceed the step rate he held in his former position. Such appointment shall not set a new anniversary date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection F, when a person on a higher-level position is appointed from an eligible list to a lower-level position prior to completion of his probationary period in said higher-level position, he shall be entitled to the salary step placement and step anniversary date otherwise provided by this paragraph or the step placement and step anniversary date to which he would be entitled if such person were demoting to said lower-level position in accordance with the provisions of subsection E above, whichever is the lesser.
(Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 78, 1953.)
6.08.120 - Step Placement Upon Restoration.
A.
Except as provided in subsection C of this Section, when an employee is restored, pursuant to Civil Service Rules, to a higher-level position, he shall receive the compensation which is the higher of the following:
1.
The salary step he previously earned while holding said position if he is being restored to a higher-level position previously held by him, or the salary step he previously earned in any higher-level position from which his change of classification or demotion to the position to which he is being restored would have been authorized by the Civil Service Rules; or
2.
If at least one year has elapsed since he last held status on any higher-level position described in subsection A.1 above, the salary step rate that he would have received had he been appointed from a lower-level item to a higher-level item as provided for in Section 6.08.090; or
3.
If the employee previously held a position higher in level than the position to which he is being restored and if his restoration to said higher-level position would also be authorized by the Civil Service Rules, the salary step to which he would be entitled if he were in fact restored to said higher-level position pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 above, whichever is applicable and subsequently voluntarily demoted to the position to which he is being restored.
B.
When, as a result of a restoration, an employee's compensation is determined by subdivision Al above, he shall have the same anniversary date he had when he previously held the position; however, when such restoration follows reinstatement to county service, the date of restoration shall set a new anniversary date. When, as a result of restoration, an employee's compensation is determined by subdivision A2 above, the date of restoration shall set a new anniversary date. When, as a result of restoration, an employee's compensation is determined by subdivision A3 above, he shall have the anniversary date he would have had if his compensation were determined by Section 6.08.110 of this title.

3.
When, as a result of restoration, an employee's step placement is determined by this subsection C the date of restoration shall set a new anniversary date.
4.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection C when a person is restored, pursuant to the Civil Service Rules, to a position last held prior to a layoff, as defined in Civil Service Rule 19, his salary step placement shall be determined in accordance with the subsections A and B of this Section.

6.08.130 - Reinstatement.
A.
Except in the case of employees reinstated pursuant to Civil Service Rule 17.01B, when an employee is reinstated following separation from county service, he shall be placed at the first step of the salary range for the position to which he is reinstated, as if he were entering county service for the first time, and shall have a new anniversary date.

General. Persons temporarily appointed shall not be appointed nor advanced to steps beyond the first step of the range, except as provided for elsewhere in this Title 6.
B.
Promotions.
1.
When an employee is promoted from a permanent position to a temporary position or to a permanent position on a temporary basis, the provisions of Section 6.08.090 shall govern such promotion. The effective date of such promotion shall set a new anniversary date, and the employee shall be entitled to step advances in such higher-level position based on this new anniversary date. Upon returning to his lower-level permanent position, the employee's anniversary date on the lower-level permanent position shall be restored to him and he shall be placed on the step in the salary range of the lower-level permanent position to which he would be entitled had he remained continuously on such position.
2.
If the employee is subsequently permanently appointed to a position in the same classification which he has continuously held on a temporary basis, he shall retain the anniversary date of his temporary appointment.
(Ord. 6222 Ch. 1 Art. 5 § 81, 1953.)
6.08.150 - Step rate on change to permanent status.
A.
Any person who receives a permanent appointment to a position on the same salary schedule from a temporary, as-needed, or recurrent position, or receives an appointment to a permanent position on a lower salary schedule requiring the same general type of work, shall be entitled to a salary step rate to which his continuous service in such position would entitle him had his entire continuous service been on a permanent monthly basis. A recurrent employer who receives an appointment to a permanent position on the same salary schedule or receives an appointment to a permanent position on a lower salary schedule requiring the same general type of work following a break in continuous service and who is still on a departmental recurrent list shall be entitled to the salary-step rate to which his entire recurrent service on such positions would entitle him.

In such case, there shall be no adjustment in the Participant's salary absent specific authorization and instruction from the board of supervisors or the chief administrative officer. When an employee's salary rate falls below the minimum of the Salary range, it shall not constitute a demotion.
C.
Placement in Salary Range. By specific action, the board of supervisors or the chief administrative officer may provide for salary placement of an employee at any rate within the established Salary range for the position he/she holds.
D.
Equivalency of Compensation.

Said person will be placed within the new Salary range at his/her then current salary or for Tier II, placed on the nearest step that does not result in a decrease in salary for the participant. Where the new position is outside the Plan, the employee's salary step placement shall be determined as otherwise provided by this code.
F.
Reduction of Salary Range. When a person continues to hold a position whose Salary range is reduced or which is reclassified to a lower level, said person will be placed within the new Salary range at his/her current salary or for Tier II, placed on the nearest step that does not result in a decrease in salary for the participant. If the current salary is higher than the new salary range maximum, said person's rate of pay shall be identified as a Y-Rate, which shall remain until such time as the Y-Rate is within the Salary range for the position.
G.
Appointment to Lower-Level Position. When a person on a higher position is appointed from an eligible list to a lower-level position, or is voluntarily reduced, he/she shall be placed at any salary within the Salary range for the lower-level position or his/her current salary, whichever is less. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection G, a person appointed prior to completion of his/her probationary period on the higher position shall be placed at a salary within the Salary range of the lower position, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.08.345.
H.
Equivalency of Grade. A class in Tier I is deemed to be equal in grade to a class in Tier II if the two Salary ranges are equal in terms of the minimum and maximum rates as indicated by the numeric designation assigned to the Salary ranges. (A class compensated at R10 in Tier I is, for example, equal in grade to a class compensated at S10 in Tier II). A class in Tier I or Tier II is deemed equal in grade to a class paid in accordance with Chapter 6.08, Part 5 of this title if the top step of the class compensated under Part 5 is less than 2.75 percent above or below the maximum of the Salary range for the Tier I or Tier II class as the case may be. A class in Tier I or Tier II is deemed equal in grade to a class paid in accordance with all other classes that are not designated for the Plan if the maximum of the non-MAPP class is less than 2.75 percent above or below the Control Point of the Salary range for the Tier I or Tier II class.
I.
Exception for Certain Participants. The compensation of any Participant employed in a class or position designated by an item sub other than "A" or "L" pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.28.020 A shall be limited to that provided by this subsection.
