Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of this Code, the Building Official shall have the authority to grant modifications on a case-by-case basis, upon application by the owner or the owner's authorized agent, provided the Building Official shall first find that a special individual reason makes the strict letter of this Code impractical and that the modification is in conformity with the spirit and purpose of this Code and that such modification does not lessen any fire-protection or other life-safety-related requirements, accessibility, or any degree of structural integrity. The details of any action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the code enforcement agency.
A written application for a modification shall be submitted together with a filing fee of $237.20. When staff review exceeds two hours, an additional fee of $118.60 per hour shall be charged for each hour or fraction thereof in excess of two hours.
