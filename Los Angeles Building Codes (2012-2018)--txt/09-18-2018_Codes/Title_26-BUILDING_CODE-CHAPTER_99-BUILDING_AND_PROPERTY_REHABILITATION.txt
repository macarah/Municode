The Building Official, after determining that conditions warrant reconsideration, may bring any matter before the Board for rehearing. At such a rehearing, the Board will consider all evidence submitted and after such reconsideration may find that further postponement is unwarranted and so order, or may find that a new order for abatement and/or postponement of county action is warranted and order any abatement work considered necessary to be performed by a specified date, after which date the Building Official shall cause such work to be performed or completed without further notice.
(Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
SECTION 9925 - WORK BY PRIVATE PARTY
Any person having the legal right to do so may repair or demolish a substandard building or do any other work required to remove the substandard conditions at any time prior to the time when the County does so, but if such person does such work after the time specified in the Notice of Substandard Building or Substandard Property if no hearing was requested, otherwise, after the time specified in the last order of the Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board, all costs incurred by the County in preparation for the doing of such work are chargeable to the property and shall be collected as provided in Sections 9928 and 9929.
If such work is completed after the Building Official or purchasing agent has awarded a contract for such work, the contractor shall receive the Contract Cancellation Fee as specified in Table 1-F, for the building official's overhead and incidental expenses, unless specifically excluded by contract, and said fee plus the amount specified in Section 9927 shall be the costs incurred by the County. If such work is completed before the Building Official or purchasing agent has awarded a contract, the amount specified in Section 9927 shall be the costs incurred by the County.
(Ord. 2002-0076 § 181, 2002: Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
SECTION 9926 - WORK BY COUNTY
9926.1 - Procedures.
If the order of the Board requires the repair or demolition of any building, the order of the Board is not complied with within the period designated by the Board and the public records show that there is any person who has any right, title or interest in the property or any part thereof by virtue of a document duly recorded prior to the recordation of the Declaration of Substandard Building or Property, whether such document describes such property or part thereof, or not, and such person has not been previously notified of the action of the Board during the processing of the case, the Building Official shall serve upon such person as provided in Section 9920 a notice of the action of the Board which notice also shall contain a statement that the County will demolish the building or take such other action as may be necessary to remove the substandard conditions unless such person, within 10 days, requests, in writing, a hearing. If such person requests such a hearing the Board shall hold such hearing as provided in this Chapter at which hearing the Board shall redetermine the facts and make a new order as provided in Section 9923 and the former order shall cease to be of any force or effect. If any Board order made pursuant to Section 9923 or 9924 and not superseded, or any order made pursuant to this Section is not complied with within the period designated, the Building Official may then demolish the substandard building or portions thereof, or may cause such other work to be done to the extent necessary to eliminate the hazard and other substandard conditions determined to exist by the Board. If the order of the Board does not require the repair or demolition of any building, no notice of such order need be given to any person other than the party concerned.
(Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
9926.2 - Emergency Procedures.
When in the opinion of the Building Official a substandard structure or portion thereof is an immediate hazard to life and property, and the abatement of such hazard requires action pursuant to the exception in Section 9910, the Building Official may then demolish the substandard building, or portion thereof, or may cause such other work to be done to the extent necessary to eliminate the hazard.
(Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
SECTION 9927 - COSTS
The costs involved in the demolition or other work by the Building Official, including, in addition to other costs, the applicable processing costs as set forth in Table 1-F, shall become a special assessment against the property.
(Ord. 2002-0076 § 182, 2002: Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
SECTION 9928 - NOTIFICATION OF COSTS
The Building Official shall notify, in writing, all parties concerned and all persons notified pursuant to Section 9914, 9917, or 9926 of the amount of such assessment resulting from such work. Within five days of the receipt of such notice any such party concerned and any other person having any right, title, or interest in the property or part thereof may file with the Building Official a written request for a hearing on the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such assessment.
Any such person who did not receive a notice pursuant to Sections 9910, 9911, 9914 or 9920, and who has not had a hearing on the necessity of the demolition or other work, in such request for hearing also may ask that such necessity be reviewed. The Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board thereupon shall set the matter for hearing, give such person notice thereof as provided in Section 9914, hold such hearing and determine the reasonableness or correctness of the assessment, or both, and if requested, the necessity of the demolition or other work. The Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board shall notify all such persons of its decision in writing.
If the total assessment determined as provided for in this Section is not paid in full within 10 days after mailing of such notice by the Building Official, the Building Official shall place such charge as a special assessment on the tax bill for the property pursuant to Section 25845 of the Government Code.
(Ord. 2002-0076 § 183, 2002; Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
SECTION 9929 - COLLECTION
The assessment shall be collected at the time and in the same manner as ordinary County taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary County taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of County taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment.
(Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
SECTION 9930 - SALVAGE
If a building is demolished or necessary work done by the County pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, the value of any salvage resulting from such demolition or other work may be applied to the cost of such work as follows:
1.
If the County enters into a contract with a private contractor, the County may provide in such contract that as a part of the consideration for the services rendered, the contractor shall take title to such salvage.
2.
If the contract does not so provide or if the County does the work without such a contract, the County may take title to such salvage and credit the reasonable value thereof on the costs incurred by the County. In any hearing pursuant to this Section to determine the reasonable cost of doing the work, the Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board also may determine the reasonable value, if any, of such salvage.
This Section is permissive only and does not require that the value of such salvage be applied to the cost of the work.
(Ord. 99-0040 § 77 (part), 1999.)
SECTION 9931 - INTERFERENCE PROHIBITED
A person shall not obstruct, impede, or interfere with the Building Official or any representative of the Building Official, or with any person who owns or holds any interest or estate in a substandard building which has been ordered by the Building Official or by the Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board to be barricaded, repaired, vacated and repaired, or vacated and demolished or removed, or in any substandard property whenever the Building Official or such owner is engaged in barricading, repairing, vacating and repairing, or demolishing any such substandard building or removing any substandard conditions, pursuant to this Chapter, Section 102 of Chapter 1, or in the performance of any necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work, or authorized or directed pursuant hereto.
