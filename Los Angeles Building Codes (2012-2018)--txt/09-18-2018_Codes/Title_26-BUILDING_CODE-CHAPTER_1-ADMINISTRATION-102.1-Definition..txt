All unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be public nuisances. In addition to instituting any appropriate action to prevent, restrain or correct a violation of this section, the Building Official may abate an unsafe condition or order that the unsafe condition be secured, repaired, rehabilitated, demolished or removed as deemed necessary by the Building Official in accordance with the procedure specified in this Code.
