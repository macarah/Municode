Upon presentation of documentary proof of a bona fide emergency to the appointing authority, such a person holding a position compensated on a monthly or per-annum basis may receive one salary advance during any calendar year of up to 50 percent of his last regular payroll warrant, provided he has accrued work or leave time to his credit to cover the period for which the advance is made. Such advance shall not be issued prior to 15 days after the last regular payday, and it shall be deducted from the next regularly issued payroll warrant.
C.
Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, employees shall be paid on a semi-monthly basis on or about the thirtieth day of the month for services rendered from the first day through the fifteenth day of the month, and on or about the fifteenth day of the succeeding month for services rendered from the sixteenth day through the last day of the month.

If an appropriate rate cannot be found in the Standardized Salary Schedule, the hourly rate shall equal the monthly rate divided by 174, and the daily rate shall equal the hourly rate multiplied by eight. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, the semi-monthly rate shall equal the monthly rate divided by 2 or the hourly rate multiplied by 87.

An employee may be paid a salary advance upon the certification of the employee's department head that such employee will be on an approved leave of absence of at least 10 consecutive working days extending over the employee's regularly established payday, provided he has accrued work or leave time to his credit to cover the period for which the advance is made. Such salary advance shall be paid in accordance with rules and procedures promulgated by the auditor-controller and approved by the board of supervisors. Effective beginning on and after April 1, 2010, or such later date as may be determined by the Chief Administrative Officer when the human resources management system reflecting this provision is implemented, salary advances associated with approved leaves of absences will no longer be available.

6.24.060 - Reducing monthly pay for time not worked.
Unless where expressly provided to the contrary in this Title 6, it is and has been the county's policy that an employee's monthly pay is required to be reduced on an hourly basis for scheduled hours not worked or not covered by paid leave benefits provided for in Titles 5 and 6 of the Los Angeles County Code. Where a person is employed on a less than full time monthly permanent position, any applicable benefits earned shall be in an amount equal to the item sub fractional amount, as defined in Section 6.28.020.
(Ord. 2005-0019 § 19, 2005; Ord. 93-0019 § 32, 1993.)
6.24.070 - Temporary pay deduction.
A.
Salary Deduction. During the period October 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994, 2.0% shall be deducted from the pay of each nonrepresented employee, as defined in Chapter 6.04. This deduction shall be determined by calculating the employee's actual pay based on the pay rate contained in this Title 6, plus any earned pay period bonuses stated as a percent of pay or number of additional schedules and/or levels and multiplying the result by 2.0%. No deduction shall be taken for the portion of the month in which the employee is receiving sick leave at part pay pursuant to Section 6.20.040.
B.
Special Vacation. Notwithstanding any other provision of the code, for each calendar month in which an employee receives a pay deduction as described above, such employee will be credited with .0201 of an hour of special vacation for each qualifying hour. For purposes of this section, qualifying hours means hours worked during a work period, industrial disability hours paid pursuant to Section 6.20.070, or paid leaves of absence hours paid pursuant to Titles 5 and 6. Such special vacation shall be credited to the employee on the first day of the month after the month in which it is earned. The employee may use special vacation with prior management approval once it has been credited.
C.
Payoff of Special Vacation. On or after August 1, 1995, at the employee's option, unused special vacation may be converted to pay. An employee electing payment for any portion of the employee's special vacation balance may submit a request to management and, within 45 days of that request, shall be paid for such unused special vacation at the workday rate then in effect for the employee. Whenever an employee terminates county employment, that employee shall be paid at the workday rate then in effect for any remaining special vacation. The board of supervisors may direct at any time prior to termination that some or all employees be paid at the workday rate then in effect for the employee for some or all of the unused special vacation.
