Parts:
Part 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
Sections:

5.18.010 - Adoption—Purpose.
The County of Los Angeles, pursuant to the order of its Board of Supervisors, hereby adopts the "County of Los Angeles Termination Pay Pick Up Plan," effective as of [_____], 2004. The Plan is designated a profit sharing plan and is intended to qualify under Code section 401(a).
The Plan is designed to allow Participants to contribute a portion of their Termination Pay to the Plan and have the County pick up such contributions as provided in Code section 414(h)(2), for the purpose of providing retirement and death benefits to Participants.
While the County intends to continue the Plan, it reserves the right to amend and/or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, at any time, subject to negotiations with employee representatives. Benefits under the Plan shall at all times be limited to those payable from a Participant's account to the extent funded by contributions that have been made and credited to such account. Therefore, neither participation in the Plan nor eligibility thereafter shall entitle any employee to have the Plan or any of its provisions continued for his benefit in the future.

The County shall pick up such contribution under Code section 414(h)(2).
B.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, on and after January 26, 2007, no Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreements shall be executed, and no Termination Pay Contributions shall be made to or received by the Plan on behalf of any Participant irrespective of whether such Participant has executed a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement before that date.

B.
The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is binding and irrevocable upon execution. A Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is deemed executed on the date the completed, signed Agreement is filed with the County or its agent. Once executed, the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement may not be amended or revoked. An Eligible Employee who executes a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement shall thereafter have no option to receive in cash, or to otherwise direct the disposition of, the fixed percentage or dollar amount of his Termination Pay that he has elected to contribute to the Plan as a Termination Pay Contribution. The Plan shall not accept contributions from any source other than those deducted from Termination Pay.
This Plan does not restrict the Participant's ability to utilize any accrued benefits by taking vacation, sick or other leave while employed with the County.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.18.080, a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement must be executed at least 90 days prior to the Participant's Severance Date. The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is effective upon execution. The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement, however, shall not apply to any Termination Pay that becomes payable in the event the Eligible Employee's Severance Date is less than 90 days after the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is executed, unless the Eligible Employee experiences an Involuntary Early Severance. If the Participant's Severance Date occurs later than originally designated, the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement will remain effective until his actual Severance Date.
D.
If a Participant is rehired by the County after his Severance Date, any Termination Pay Contribution made on his behalf to the Plan shall remain in the Plan unless and until it is distributed in accordance with Part 6, and the cashed out accrued benefits attributable thereto shall NOT be restored for any reason.
E.
Each Eligible Employee shall be eligible to make only one election to have Termination Pay picked up within the meaning of Code section 414(h)(2). Accordingly, an Eligible Employee may not execute more than one Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement. If the Eligible Employee intends to have a portion of his Termination Pay picked up and contributed to purchase service with LACERA and a portion of his Termination Pay picked up and contributed to the Plan, he must execute a single Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement covering both elections. If the Eligible Employee elects to contribute Termination Pay both to LACERA and to the Plan, his Termination Pay will be picked up and contributed first to LACERA, in satisfaction of the election to purchase additional retirement credit under the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement, and second to the Plan, in satisfaction of the election to contribute to the Plan under the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement. In no event, will the Termination Pay Contribution under the Plan exceed the amount of Termination Pay available after deduction therefrom to make contributions to LACERA in accordance with the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement.
F.
Termination Pay Contributions made pursuant to this Part 3., although designated under the Plan as employee contributions, shall be paid by the County in lieu of employee contributions.
G.
The Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement shall be signed by the employee. It shall provide that the employee authorizes the appropriate deduction from Termination Pay for the purposes of having it picked up and contributed to the Plan by the County, and that the employee understands and acknowledges the requirements and limitations of this Section 5.18.080.

As a condition to entering the Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement, the County may require an employee to execute a release from liability for any adverse consequences that may result if the Internal Revenue Service or a court determines that a contribution to the Plan pursuant to a Payroll Deduction Authorization Agreement is not a picked up contribution within the meaning of IRC Section 414(h)(2), or that the Plan is not a Qualified Plan.
(Ord. 2004-0063 § 1 (part), 2004.)
5.18.090 - Payment to Trustee.
Each Termination Pay Contribution shall be paid by the County to the Trustee within a reasonable period after a Participant's Severance Date, but in no event later than the last day of the month following the month containing the Participant's Severance Date or the final calculation of the amount of the Termination Pay by the County, whichever is later.

A.
The Plan assets shall be held for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to Participants and their Beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan in accordance with Part 7.
B.
If a Termination Pay Contribution is made by the County due to a mistake of fact, such contribution shall thereafter be returned to the Participant to the extent permitted by applicable law. Additionally, if the Plan, or a portion thereof, is determined by the Internal Revenue Service not to satisfy the requirements of Code section 401(a) for a qualified plan, any Termination Pay Contributions attributable to the period for which it is determined not to be so qualified shall, at the direction of the Administrative Committee, be returned to the Participant.

As of each Valuation Date, the net gain or loss of each Investment Fund, determined in accordance with subsection 5.18.140.B of this Part, shall be allocated by the Trustee or its Agent in accordance with the instructions received by the Trustee from the TPA to the Account of Participants in such Investment Funds in proportion to the amounts of such Account invested in such Investment Fund on such Valuation Date, exclusive of amounts to be credited but including amounts (other than the net loss, if any, determined pursuant to subsection 5.18.100.B) to be debited to such Account as of such Valuation Date.
B.
Valuation.
1.
As of the close of business each Valuation Date, the Administrative Committee, its Agent or the Trustee, if it is a Discretionary Trustee, shall determine or cause to be determined the value of each Investment Fund. The Administrative Committee, its Agent or such Discretionary Trustee may rely on net asset value calculations, book values and other data with respect to the value of Plan assets held in the Investment Funds furnished to it by the Investment Managers, the County Treasurer, custodians or other entities authorized to provide valuation data. If the Trustee is not a Discretionary Trustee responsible for valuation, the Administrative Committee or its Agent shall communicate such valuation to the Trustee.
2.
Each such valuation shall be made on the basis of the net gain or loss to each such Investment Fund between the current Valuation Date and the last preceding Valuation Date. The net gain or loss of an Investment Fund shall include realized and unrealized earnings, interest income, dividends actually paid and other income of such Fund during such period, and shall be reduced by expenses paid, if any, that are to be charged to such Investment Fund in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement. The transfer of funds to or from an Investment Fund, the allocation of Termination Pay Contributions, and payments, distributions and withdrawals from an Investment Fund to provide benefits under the Plan for Participants or Beneficiaries shall not be deemed to be income, expenses or losses of the Investment Fund. A similar valuation shall be made at any other time the Administrative Committee or its Agent deems it appropriate to make such a valuation.
3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Committee or its Agent may, in accordance with applicable requirements of the Code and California law, (a) adopt, or instruct a Discretionary Trustee to adopt, such accounting procedures as the Administrative Committee or its Agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to establish a proportionate crediting of net gain or loss of an Investment Fund and of Contributions made to an Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date, and (b) adopt, or instruct a Discretionary Trustee to adopt, such other valuation procedures as the Administrative Committee or its Agent considers appropriate, reasonable and equitable to determine the value of the Investment Funds. The reasonable and equitable decision of the Administrative Committee or a Discretionary Trustee, as applicable, as to the value of each Investment Fund as of each Valuation Date shall be conclusive and binding upon all Participants and Beneficiaries having any interest, direct or indirect, in such Investment Fund.
C.
No Guarantee Against Loss. The County, the Board, the Administrative Committee, the TPA and the Trustee do not guarantee in any manner the Investment Funds or any part thereof against loss or depreciation. All persons having an interest in the Investment Funds shall look solely to such Funds for payment with respect to such interest.

(Ord. 2004-0063 § 1 (part), 2004.)
5.18.220 - Rollovers.
A.
Rollovers From the Plan.
1.
A Participant who is entitled to receive an Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Plan may direct the Administrative Committee to have the distribution transferred in a lump sum directly to the trustee of an Eligible Retirement Plan; provided, however, that an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Code section 457(b), which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Code section 457(e)(1)(A), may receive an Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Plan only if it provides for separate accounting as required under Code section 402(c)(10).
2.
In order for a transfer to be made with respect to a Participant under this Section, (a) the Participant must designate in writing the Eligible Retirement Plan to receive the transferred amounts; (b) the Participant must timely provide the Administrative Committee with adequate information to enable the Administrative Committee to determine that the transferee plan is an Eligible Retirement Plan described above; (c) the entire amount to be transferred must be an Eligible Rollover Distribution; and (d) the Participant must have received proper notice in accordance with Code section 402(f).
3.
A Participant's surviving spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution on the Participant's death under Section 5.18.160, or an Alternate Payee who is a Participant's spouse or former spouse who becomes eligible to receive a distribution under Section 5.18.360 shall be treated as the Participant for purposes of this Section. For Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2010, a Participant's surviving Beneficiary who is not a spouse and becomes eligible to receive a distribution on the Participant's death under Section 5.18.160 of the Plan, may elect a direct trustee-to-trustee rollover to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity (as defined in Code section 408) established to receive such distribution in accordance with Code section 402(c)(11).
4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, upon termination of the Plan, in the event a Participant or Beneficiary either (i) does not make a distribution election within 30 days after the Plan furnishes the notice described in this section; or (ii) cannot be located after the Plan Administrator has made reasonable attempts to locate such Participant or Beneficiary in order to provide the notice described in this section, distribution will be made on behalf of the Participant in the form of an automatic direct rollover to an individual retirement plan (or, in the case of a non-spouse Beneficiary, an inherited individual retirement plan within the meaning of Code section 402(c)(11)). Prior to distribution, each Participant or Beneficiary shall be furnished with a notice that satisfies the requirements of 29 C.F.R. section 2550.404a-3(e)(1) unless he or she cannot be located after reasonable attempts by the Plan Administrator. Amounts automatically rolled over pursuant to this section shall be subject to a contract between the Administrative Committee and the transferee entity that is consistent with 29 C.F.R. section 2550.404a-3(d)(2). The Administrative Committee will be deemed to have satisfied its fiduciary obligations with respect to plan distributions, selection of a transferee entity and investment of funds with that transferee entity provided such actions are taken in accordance with this section. Upon completion of the direct rollover of a Participant's or Beneficiary's Account pursuant to this subsection, such Participant or Beneficiary releases and agrees, on his or her behalf and on behalf of his or her heirs and beneficiaries, to hold harmless the County, the Board of Supervisors, the Administrative Committee, the TPA, the Trustee and any agent, officer or employee of any of them, from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, costs or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by or arising out of the automatic rollover of funds to the individual retirement plan, including without limitation any diminution in value or losses incurred within the individual retirement plan.
B.
Rollovers to the Plan Not Permitted.
1.
The Plan shall not accept any cash or property that constitutes an Eligible Rollover Distribution from an Eligible Retirement Plan.

For purposes of its determination, the Administrative Committee shall take into account (i) direct, additional County costs expected to be incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions defined in Part 7 and (ii) the cost of contractors that provide services to the Plan, including, without limitation, fiduciary and liability insurance coverage, communication consultants, investment advisors, auditors and legal services, pursuant to contracts that are approved by the Board or the Administrative Committee. The expenses subject to this subsection A shall not include: (1) TPA fees, or (2) Trustee fees and investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds, all of which are addressed in subsection B.

The expenses incurred as a result of County employees performing the functions defined in Part 7 shall not exceed the amount approved by the Board of Supervisors in the County budget.

4.
The estimated annual fees for the Plan approved by the Administrative Committee pursuant to this subsection will be charged to each Participant's account on a per-capita basis. The per-Participant, annual charge will be determined by dividing the estimated annual fees for the Plan by the number of Participants on the last day of the month prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the fees are being determined. The per-Participant annual charge will be divided by 12 and billed monthly to each Participant's account during the fiscal year. A Participant will be billed only for months in which he or she has an account balance in the Plan. The monthly charges will appear on the Participant's quarterly statement.
5.
Employees who become Participants in the Plan during the fiscal year will be charged the same monthly per-Participant charge determined prior to the beginning of the fiscal year by the Administrative Committee.

Until such time as the Administrative Committee approves a new annual fee, Participants will be charged the same monthly per-Participant charge as previously set by the Administrative Committee.

Expenses incurred by members of the Administrative Committee as a result of performing their duties under the Plan will be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and paid to the member incurring such expense.

B.
TPA, Trustee fees, and investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds are limited by the contract or contracts approved by the Administrative Committee or the Board. TPA and Trustee fees will be charged through the Trustee or reimbursed from Plan assets and will be allocated to the individual Participants' accounts and reflected on quarterly statements. Investment management and custodial fees incident to the Investment Funds shall be periodically charged to the appropriate Investment Fund.
C.
In the event that the Plan accumulates (i) fees in excess of actual administrative expenses, or (ii) unallocated earnings from Plan operations, the Administrative Committee shall allocate excess fees and earnings first by establishing a reserve for contingencies and payment of planned obligations not to exceed 100% of the aggregate total annual County fees, TPA fees, and Trustee fees charged to Participants the preceding fiscal year, and then by allocating any remainder by reducing TPA fees charged to Participants by a method determined by the Administrative Committee.
(Ord. 2004-0063 § 1 (part), 2004.)

The determination of the Administrative Committee as to the denial of a claim on appeal shall be final and binding to the extent permitted by law.

Upon receipt of a domestic relations order, or, if earlier, notice that a domestic relations order may be sought, the Administrative Committee shall suspend distributions from the Participant's Account, and shall take steps to ensure that the Participant and each Alternate Payee is aware of the order or proposed order and the suspension of distributions from the Participant's Account. Moreover, the Administrative Committee shall determine, within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, whether such order is a QDRO. If the order is determined to be a QDRO, the Alternate Payee's interest under such order shall be segregated and/or distributed in accordance with the QDRO and this Section.

C.
Distributions to the Alternate Payee shall be made in accordance with the QDRO provided that the QDRO does not conflict with the Plan's distribution provisions or the provisions of this Section 5.18.360. The Alternate Payee's interest may be distributed only in a lump-sum cash payment.
D.
The Alternate Payee's interest specified in the QDRO shall be segregated and/or distributed from the Participant's Account, and the Investment Funds in which such Account are invested, on a pro rata basis.
E.
Unless the QDRO provides otherwise, an Alternate Payee shall have the right, in the same manner as a Participant, to designate a Beneficiary, who shall receive benefits payable to the Alternate Payee in the event that all of the Alternate Payee's benefits have not been distributed at the time of the Alternate Payee's death. If the Alternate Payee does not designate a Beneficiary, or if the Beneficiary predeceases the Alternate Payee, benefits payable to the Alternate Payee which have not been distributed shall be paid to the Alternate Payee's estate. Any death benefits payable under this Section shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the Administrative Committee receives notice of the Alternate Payee's death, with or without the Beneficiary's consent.
