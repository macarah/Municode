20.40.030 - Legislative intent—Basis for levy of charges.
The action of the voters on June 6, 1978, has substantially reduced the amount of money from ad valorem assessments available for the maintenance of sewers within the District. The sewers in the District must be properly maintained in order to protect the public health and safety of the residents therein and the general public. It is therefore necessary to impose a sewer maintenance service charge upon the properties within the District. As used herein, "maintenance" includes acquisition, construction, reconstruction, maintenance and operation, and sewer maintenance service charges collected under this chapter may be used for any purpose authorized by Section 5471 of the Health and Safety Code of the state of California. In order to avoid the substantial costs of establishing a billing system for collection of the charges, the board of supervisors finds that the charges should be collected on the tax roll. The board of supervisors further finds that the most equitable basis upon which to levy the charge is on the basis of the land use of each parcel of property within the District, as shown on the assessor's rolls.
(Ord. 2008-0032 § 1, 2008: Ord. 85-0118U § 1, 1985: Ord. 11751 Art. 1 § 102, 1978.)
20.40.040 - Levy of annual service charge—Amount.
An annual sewer service charge is levied upon each parcel of real property in the District for the services and facilities furnished by the District.

The number of sewage units applicable to designated land uses is shown in on Table A in Section 20.40.100. A parcel's designated land use is shown on the assessor's rolls. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2012-13 the sewage unit charge shall be $35.50. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2013-14 the sewage unit charge shall be $38.50.
