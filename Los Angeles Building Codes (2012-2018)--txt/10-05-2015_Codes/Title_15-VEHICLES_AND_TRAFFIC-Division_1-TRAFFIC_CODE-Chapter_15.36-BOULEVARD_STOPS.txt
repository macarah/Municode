Chapter 15.36 - BOULEVARD STOPS
Sections:

15.36.010 - Dangerous intersections—Flashing red signal or stop sign required.
If the board determines that an intersection of two or more highways or of a railroad and one or more highways is an intersection at which there is especial hazard to life and property by reason of the volume of traffic upon such highways or railroad, or both, or at such intersection, or because of lack of visibility to the drivers of vehicles approaching such highways or railroad, or intersections, or because of the number of reported accidents or the apparent probability thereof, or by reason of physical conditions which render such highways or intersections exceptionally dangerous or hazardous to life or property, and where the factors creating the special hazard are such that, according to the principles and experience of traffic engineering, requiring vehicles to stop before entering such intersection is reasonably calculated to reduce the expectancy of accidents, and that the use of warning signs would be inadequate, the commissioner shall:
A.
At an intersection controlled by an official traffic-control signal, provide that when such signal is not in normal operation, it shall indicate a flashing red signal at the designated entrances;
B.
At intersections not controlled by official traffic-control signals, erect, or cause to be erected, boulevard stop signs complying with the provisions of the Vehicle Code at the designated entrance to such intersections.
(Ord. 8504 § 1, 1963: Ord. 6544 Ch. 4 § 4001, 1954.)
15.36.020 - Removal of stop sign after traffic-control signal installed.
If an official traffic-control signal is erected at any intersection at which one or more boulevard stop signs have been erected, the commissioner shall remove such stop signs before January 1, 1965, or at the time the official traffic-control signal first operates, whichever is later.
(Ord. 8504 § 2, 1963: Ord. 6544 Ch. 4 § 4001.5, 1954.)
15.36.030 - No stop required—Conditions designated.
No stop need be made at any such intersection where:
A.
An officer is on duty and directs traffic to proceed;
B.
A stop-and-go signal is in operation and indicates that traffic may proceed;
C.
The stop sign has been removed either pursuant to Section 15.20.160 or otherwise;
D.
The stop sign has been covered as provided in Section 15.20.160;
E.
The operator turns right into a highway from a separate right-turn lane which lane is delineated by buttons, markers or channelization, and no stop sign is in place at the intersection of such separate right-turn lane and such highway.
(Ord. 6968 § 1, 1956; Ord. 6544 Ch. 4 § 4002, 1954.)
15.36.040 - Yield right-of-way signs—Installation required when.
The commissioner shall erect, or cause to be erected, yield right-of-way signs complying with provisions of the Vehicle Code at one or more approaches to an intersection of highways which are not through highways, where the board has determined that because of lack of visibility, or because of the number of reported accidents or the apparent probability thereof, such signs are considered necessary, and where according to the principles and experience of traffic engineering the installation of stop signs is not justified.
(Ord. 6800 § 1 (part), 1955: Ord. 6544 Ch. 4 § 4003, 1954.)
15.36.050 - Yield right-of-way signs—Exceptions to driver compliance.
Compliance with the yield right-of-way sign shall not be required where:
A.
An officer is on duty and directs traffic to proceed without yielding the right-of-way;
B.
The yield right-of-way sign has been removed either pursuant to Section 15.20.160 or otherwise;
C.
The yield right-of-way sign has been covered as provided in Section 15.20.160.
(Ord. 6800 § 1 (part), 1955: Ord. 6544 Ch. 4 § 4004, 1954.)
15.36.060 - Emergency conditions—Stop sign installation authority.
Where any emergency conditions described in Section 15.36.010 exist, the commissioner may erect or cause to be erected boulevard stop signs complying with the Vehicle Code, as provided in Section 15.36.010, and maintain such signs while such conditions continue.
(Ord. 6968 § 2, 1956: Ord. 6544 Ch. 4 § 4005, 1954.)
