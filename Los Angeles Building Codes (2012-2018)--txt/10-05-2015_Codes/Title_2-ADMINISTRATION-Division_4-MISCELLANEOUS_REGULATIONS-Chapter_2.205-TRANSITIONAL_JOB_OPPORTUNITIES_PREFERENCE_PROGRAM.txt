Chapter 2.205 - TRANSITIONAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES PREFERENCE PROGRAM
Sections:

2.205.010 - Introduction.
The Board of Supervisors finds that it is of benefit to the County of Los Angeles to promote and facilitate transitional job opportunities for individuals who are homeless and other individuals who have been out of work for an extended period of time. Individuals who have not worked for an extended period of time face considerable barriers when trying to re-enter the workforce. Transitional employment provides people who are the hardest to employ with opportunities to develop job and social skills that are necessary to succeed in the workplace. Nonprofit businesses with transitional employment programs incur higher overhead costs than other businesses due to the need for increased supervision, counseling, and training of the hardest to employ. Therefore, such agencies are at a competitive disadvantage in obtaining County contracts, in which estimated cost is a significant factor.
(Ord. 2007-0013 § 1 (part), 2007.)
2.205.020 - Purpose.
The County of Los Angeles transitional job opportunities preference program is a race and gender-neutral program designed to establish a purchasing and contracting preference for nonprofit organizations which provide transitional jobs to the long-term unemployed in the execution of their work under a purchase order or contract with the County of Los Angeles. The transitional job opportunities preference program is designed to promote and foster inclusiveness and economic development, as well as ongoing evaluation to assure that all businesses, including nonprofit businesses that provide transitional employment services, are provided equal opportunities in county purchasing and contracting activities.
