Chapter 11.35 - TOBACCO RETAILING
Sections:

11.35.010 - Purpose and application.
In promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its residents, the County of Los Angeles has a substantial interest in encouraging compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating tobacco sales and use; in discouraging the purchase and use of tobacco products by minors; in increasing compliance with laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors; and in protecting children from being lured into illegal activity through the misconduct of adults. It is the intent of this ordinance to encourage responsible tobacco retailing and to discourage violations of tobacco-related laws, especially those that prohibit the sale or distribution of tobacco products to minors, but not to expand or reduce the degree to which the acts regulated by federal or state law are criminally proscribed or otherwise regulated.

Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any licensee any status or right other than to act as a tobacco retailer at the location identified on the face of the license, subject to compliance with all other applicable laws, regulations, or ordinances.

11.35.050 - Issuance and renewal of license.

The application is incomplete or inaccurate;
2.
The department has information that the applicant, or his/her agents or employees, has violated any local, state, or federal tobacco control law at the location for which the license or renewal license is sought within the preceding sixty (60) days; or
3.
The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at an address where a previous license has been suspended, revoked, or is subject to suspension or revocation proceedings for any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. However, this shall not constitute a basis for denial of a license if either or both of the following apply:
a.
The applicant provides documentation which clearly demonstrates that the applicant has acquired or is in the process of acquiring the premises or business in an arm's length transaction; or
b.
It has been more than five years since the most recent license for that location was revoked.

Renewal of tobacco retailing license. A license shall be valid for one year and must be renewed between thirty and sixty days prior to the expiration of the license. A license may be renewed for additional one year periods by submission of a renewal application and the applicable fee. Any license that is suspended, has been revoked within the previous five years, or is subject to suspension or revocation proceedings shall not be renewed.
(Ord. 2007-0118 § 3 (part), 2007.)
11.35.060 - License nontransferable.
A tobacco retailing license is nontransferable. If a licensee changes business location, that licensee must obtain a new license prior to acting as a tobacco retailer at the new location.

A licensee served with a notice of suspension or revocation may request an administrative review to contest the suspension or revocation.

C.
After receiving a timely administrative review request, the director shall schedule an administrative review within twenty calendar days of receipt of the written request and designate a reviewing officer. The director may, in his/her discretion, appoint as a reviewing officer any department or other county employee with expertise in public health who is not directly involved in inspection or enforcement of tobacco retailing establishments.
D.
The proprietor shall be given written notice of the date, time, and location of the administrative review and the name of the reviewing officer who will conduct the administrative review at least ten calendar days in advance of the review.
E.
The reviewing officer, in his/her discretion, may grant a continuance upon the written request and showing of good cause. In no event shall the continuance be longer than thirty calendar days from the originally scheduled review date.
F.
At the administrative review, the department has the burden of providing by a preponderance of the evidence that the alleged violation occurred.
G.
The failure to appear at the administrative review shall constitute an abandonment of the review request and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
H.
Within ten calendar days after the close of the administrative review, the reviewing officer shall issue a written decision on the suspension or revocation of the license, including a statement of the basis for the decision. The reviewing officer's written decision shall constitute the final administrative decision of the county.
