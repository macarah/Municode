Chapter 10.37 - POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS DOGS
Sections:

10.37.010 - Purpose of this chapter.

The provisions of this chapter set forth the procedures by which a dog is found to be a potentially dangerous dog or a vicious dog, thereby becoming subject to appropriate controls and other actions. This chapter is intended to supplement rather than supplant any other remedy available under state statute or county ordinance.
