  b.
When the number of trees identified for review in the oak tree report is 1,000 or more, the applicant shall pay directly to the fire department a deposit of $1,000.00 from which actual costs shall be billed and deducted.
— If during the oak tree inspection process, actual costs incurred reach 80 percent of the amount on deposit, the applicant shall be notified by the fire department and required to submit a minimum supplemental deposit in the amount of $1,000.00 directly to the fire department. There is no limit to the number of supplemental deposits that may be required to be submitted to the fire department prior to completion or withdrawal of the inspection report.
— If an initial or supplemental deposit is not received by the fire department within 30 days of notification that such deposit is due and payable, all work shall be discontinued until such deposit is received.
— At the sole discretion of the applicant, the amount of an initial or supplemental deposit may exceed the minimum amount defined herein, except that at no time shall such initial or supplemental deposit be less than the minimum requirement.
— The final oak tree inspection fee shall be based on actual costs incurred by the fire department.
— Costs shall be computed on a monthly basis and deducted from the amount on deposit. The oak tree inspection fee shall be considered final upon completion of the review process. If final costs do not exceed the amount on deposit, the unused portion shall be refunded to the applicant.
— Should the inspection request be withdrawn, costs to date shall be computed and the unused portion of the amount on deposit shall be refunded to the applicant.
— Costs shall be computed using actual hours expended by fire staff multiplied by the most current applicable hourly rates, approved by the County auditor-controller, that are available at the time that costs are assessed.
— Cost data used to determine inspection fees shall be maintained by the business office of the fire department and made available for public review while work is in progress and for three years following final action or withdrawal of the application.
