328.11 - Annual review of fees.
The fees in this Section 328 shall be reviewed annually by the fire department. Beginning on July 1, 2008, and thereafter on each succeeding July 1, the amount of each fee shall be adjusted as follows: calculate the percentage movement between March of the previous year and March of the current year in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers in the Los Angeles, Anaheim, and Riverside areas, as published by the United States Government Bureau of Labor Statistics. The adjusted fee shall be rounded to the nearest dollar; provided, however, notwithstanding any of the above, no fee shall exceed the cost of providing the service for which the fee is collected.
