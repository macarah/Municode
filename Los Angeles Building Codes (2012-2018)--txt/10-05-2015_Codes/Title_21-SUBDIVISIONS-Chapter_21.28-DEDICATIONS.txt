The subdivider's petition shall be accompanied by a plan for development of the park site, which shall be in substantial conformance with the standards for local parks contained in the Recreation Element of the General Plan, and by a statement as to when development of the proposed facilities will begin. Prior to submission of the petition, the subdivider shall obtain any permits for the private use of the park site required by the Zoning Ordinance, set out at Title 22 of this code.

A base fee equal to the local park space obligation derived from the equation set forth in Section 21.24.340, less the amount of park space, if any, provided by the subdivider pursuant to Section 21.24.350, times the representative land value for the appropriate park planning area, established as follows:

2.
As used in this Title 21, "park planning areas" means those geographical areas depicted on the 2012 park planning area map of unincorporated places and described in records retained by the Department of Parks and Recreation.
3.
For the purposes of calculating fees in lieu of park land, the schedule of representative land values contained in subsection A1 of this section shall apply to the following residential subdivision maps that are first advertised by the department of regional planning for hearing before either a hearing officer or the Regional Planning Commission on or after the effective date of the ordinance adding this language:
a.
Tentative maps;
b.
Tentative minor land division maps;
c.
Revised maps, as described in subsection B of Section 21.62.030; and
d.
Reactivated maps, which are previously approved tentative maps that have expired and that must be processed as new tentative maps.
The representative land values contained in subsection A1 of this section shall be adjusted annually, effective July 1, by the department of parks and recreation, in consultation with the county auditor-controller as follows: calculate the percentage movement between March of the previous year and March of the current year in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers in the Los Angeles, Anaheim, and Riverside areas, as published by the United States Government Bureau of Labor Statistics, adjust the representative land value per acre in each park planning area by said amount, and round to the nearest dollar. The adjusted representative land values shall apply to the above-referenced residential subdivision maps that are first advertised by the department of regional planning for hearing before either a hearing officer or the Regional Planning Commission on or after the respective July 1 adjustment date.
B.
Park fees shall be used only for the purpose of acquiring local park land or developing new or rehabilitating existing recreational facilities to serve the park planning area which includes the subdivision for which the fees were paid, or to fund improvements for county-owned local park facilities located within city limits that, but for incorporation or annexation, were within, or would have been in, the park planning area in which the subdivision for which the fees were paid is located. The advisory agency shall waive the payment of fees required pursuant to this section, if it determines that it is improbable that such funds can be utilized for this purpose within a reasonable period of time after the map of the subdivision is filed with the county recorder.
C.
The department of parks and recreation shall develop a schedule specifying how, when, and where it will use the land or fees, or both, from each subdivision to develop park or recreational facilities within the applicable park planning area. Fees collected shall be committed within five years after the payment of the fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If the fees are not committed, they, without any deductions, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision.
