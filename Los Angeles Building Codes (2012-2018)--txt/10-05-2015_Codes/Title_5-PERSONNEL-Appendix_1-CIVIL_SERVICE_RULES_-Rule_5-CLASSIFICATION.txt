Rule 5 - CLASSIFICATION
Rules:

5.01 - Standards for the classification of positions.
A.
The director of personnel shall develop and maintain a class specification for each class in the classified service of the county as necessary to meet the needs of the service for the allocation of new positions and the reallocation of existing positions. A class is a position or a number of positions with duties sufficiently similar that:
1.
The same descriptive title may be used to designate each position in the class;
2.
The same level of education, experience, knowledge, ability, and other qualifications may be required of incumbents;
3.
Similar tests of fitness may be used to select incumbents;
4.
The same schedule of compensation will apply with equity under substantially the same employment conditions.
B.
A new class shall be established when it has been determined that the duties and responsibilities of a position or positions, assigned by competent authority, are unique in terms of character, difficulty and responsibility and do not meet the specifications for an existing class.
C.
All classes involving the same character of work but differing as to level of difficulty and responsibility shall be assembled into the same series. All series within the same broad occupational field shall be assembled into the same service.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
5.02 - Classification schedules.
A.
A schematic outline of the classes in the county service and in the service of the districts which have adopted the County Civil Service System, arranged by series and services, shall be maintained by the director of personnel and shall be known as "Classification Schedule A." The specifications for each class contained in Schedule A shall be maintained by the director of personnel, and shall be known as Schedule B. Such specifications, in addition to defining the class sufficiently to provide the standard for allocation, shall give examples of the more significant and typical duties assigned to positions in the class, the minimum requirements for applicants for positions in the class, and any unusual physical requirements. The specifications shall be descriptive of the classes, and shall not be considered as a restriction on the assignment of duties not specifically listed.
B.
The director of personnel shall make such changes in Schedules A and B as are necessary to meet the needs of the service. Both schedules, or true copies thereof, shall be open to public inspection.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
5.03 - Administration of position classification.
A.
Each position in the classified service shall be allocated by the director of personnel to the appropriate class in conformance with specifications for that class as established under this Rule. The director of personnel shall make position-classification studies of individual positions or groups of positions whenever the duties or responsibilities of existing positions have undergone significant changes, or whenever new positions are to be created. Upon request of the director of personnel, the appointing power shall furnish detailed information relative to the duties, responsibilities or work assignments of positions under its jurisdiction. In addition to information requested by the director of personnel, written material bearing on the study may be submitted by the appointing power or the employee occupying the position or by the certified employee organization(s) representing the class(es).
B.
The appointing power shall initiate requests to the director of personnel for classification studies of positions under its jurisdiction whenever they have significantly changed in duties, responsibilities or work assignments.
C.
Request for a classification study of his/her position by an employee shall be directed in writing to the appointing power. Such request shall specify why the duties and responsibilities of the position no longer conform to those of the class to which the position is allocated. If the appointing power cannot support the request, it shall be returned to the employee within 30 days with reasons for its denial. If the employee judges that the request is still merited, the employee may resubmit the request to the appointing power, who shall in turn direct it to the director of personnel, who shall then conduct a study as provided in 5.03A.
D.
When the director of personnel has completed the classification study, the director shall report the findings to the appointing power concerned, and those requiring change in the Salary Ordinance (Title 6 of the Los Angeles County Code) to the board of supervisors. The appointing power shall promptly inform the employee(s) concerned of the classification action.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
5.04 - Reviews and appeals.
Any employee or appointing power adversely affected by any classification action may request the director of personnel to review such action. Such request for review by the director of personnel shall be made in writing within 30 days of notification of such action, and shall specify the basis for the request. The director of personnel shall either amend the classification action or provide the employee with reasons for affecting no change. Except as otherwise provided in these Rules, the decision of the director is final, subject to such judicial review as provided by decisions of local administrative agencies.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
5.05 - Effect of classification changes on incumbent.
A.
Whenever a position is reclassified from one class to a higher class, or from one series to another series, the incumbent shall not continue in the position, except temporarily, unless the incumbent gains eligibility for the new class and receives an appointment thereto in accordance with these Rules.
B.
Whenever a position is reclassified from one class to a lower class, the incumbent may elect to retain the position in the lower class. If the incumbent declines to retain the position in the lower class, a layoff list shall be created and the position filled by demotion in lieu of layoff in accordance with the provisions of Rule 19. Any person demoted involuntarily to fill a position reclassified downward shall be placed on a reemployment list in accordance with the provisions of Rule 19.
C.
Whenever the title of a class is changed without a change in duties or responsibilities, the incumbent shall have the same status in the new class as was held in the old class.
(Ord. 88-0020 § 1 (part), 1988.)
