Chapter 8.09 - OVERPRICING OF GOODS AND SERVICES FOLLOWING THE PROCLAMATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR THE DECLARATION OF A LOCAL EMERGENCY
Sections:

8.09.010 - Findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds that in emergencies and major natural or manmade disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes, floods, fires, storms or civil disturbances, there may be a temporary spike in demand for food, repair or reconstruction services, emergency or medical supplies, hotels, motels, housing, or gasoline. Under such circumstances, there is a heightened risk to consumers that prices for goods and services that are vital and necessary for their health, safety, and welfare may be significantly increased. Therefore, the County of Los Angeles has an interest in ensuring that County residents are protected against overpricing of vital and necessary goods and services during a state of emergency as proclaimed by the President of the United States or the Governor of California, or during a local emergency as declared pursuant to law.
(Ord. 2016-0012 § 2, 2016.)
8.09.020 - Authority.
Pursuant to California Penal Code section 396 (i), the County is authorized to enact local legislation prohibiting the overpricing of vital and necessary goods and services following the proclamation of a state of emergency or the declaration of a local emergency and impose penalties. This Chapter does not apply where prohibited or preempted by federal or State law.
(Ord. 2016-0012 § 2, 2016.)
8.09.030 - Definitions.
Unless otherwise provided below, the definitions provided by California Penal Code section 396 shall apply:

"Vital and necessary" means required to sustain the health, safety, and welfare of a person or animal.
(Ord. 2016-0012 § 2, 2016.)
8.09.040 - Overpricing Following the Proclamation or Declaration of an Emergency Prohibited.
A.
Upon the proclamation of a state of emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, or other natural or manmade disaster proclaimed by the President of the United States or the Governor of California, or upon the declaration of a local emergency resulting from an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, or other natural or manmade disaster declared pursuant to California Government Code section 8630 and Los Angeles County Code Section 2.68.110, the following shall be unlawful:
1.
Goods and Services. For a period of 30 days following that proclamation or declaration, it is unlawful for a person, contractor, business, or other entity to sell or offer to sell any vital and necessary consumer food items or goods, goods or services used for emergency cleanup, emergency supplies, medical supplies, home heating oil, building materials, housing, transportation, freight, and storage services, or gasoline or other motor fuels for a price of more than 10 percent above the price charged by that person for those goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation or declaration of emergency, subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (C) of this Section.
2.
Construction Goods and Services. For a period of 180 days following that proclamation or declaration, it is unlawful for a contractor to sell or offer to sell any vital and necessary repair or reconstruction services or any services used in emergency cleanup for a price of more than 10 percent above the price charged by that person for those services immediately prior to the proclamation or declaration of emergency, subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (C) of this Section.
3.
Hotels and Motels. For a period of 30 days following that proclamation or declaration, it is unlawful for an owner or operator of a hotel or motel to increase the hotel's or motel's regular rates, as advertised immediately prior to the proclamation or declaration of emergency, by more than 10 percent, subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (C) of this Section.
B.
A business offering an item for sale at a reduced price immediately prior to the proclamation or declaration of the emergency may use the price at which it usually sells the item to calculate the price pursuant to subsections (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this Section.
C.
For the pricing of goods and services, construction goods and services, and hotel and motel rates described in subsections (A)(1), (A)(2), and (A)(3) of this Section, a greater price increase is not unlawful if the person, contractor, business, owner, operator or other entity selling the goods or services can prove that the increase in price was directly attributable to additional costs imposed on it by the supplier of the goods, or directly attributable to additional costs for labor, goods or materials used to provide the services, provided that in those situations where the increase in price is attributable to the additional costs imposed by the seller's or contractor's supplier or additional costs of providing the goods or services during the state of emergency, the price represents no more than 10 percent above the total of the cost to the seller or contractor plus the markup customarily applied by the seller or contractor for that good or service in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the state of emergency. In addition, a greater price increase is not unlawful if an owner or operator of a hotel or motel can prove that the increase in price is due to seasonal adjustments in rates that are regularly scheduled, or to previously contracted rates.
