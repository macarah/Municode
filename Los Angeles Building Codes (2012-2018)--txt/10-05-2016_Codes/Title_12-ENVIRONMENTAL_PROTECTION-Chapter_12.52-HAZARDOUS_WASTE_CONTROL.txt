The chief shall conduct the hearing specified in the notice. The hearing shall be informal and shall not be governed by the rules of evidence applicable to courts of law.

If the determination is that the suspected failure identified in the notice has occurred, the chief shall suspend or revoke the permit. The chief shall, however, have the discretion not to suspend or revoke the permit if the chief determines that the failure was not willful, is not ongoing, and is not likely to recur.
Any hazardous waste generation or handling for which a unified program facility permit has been suspended or revoked, shall be discontinued immediately and shall not be restarted until the suspended permit has been reinstated or the revoked permit reissued.
A suspended permit may be reinstated or a revoked permit reissued if the chief determines that conditions which prompted the suspension or revocation no longer exist.
2.
The chief may suspend a permit prior to the hearing when the chief determines that such action is necessary to protect the public health and safety, domestic livestock, or wildlife from clear and imminent danger. The chief shall promptly notify the person, business, or business concern to whom the permit was issued of such suspension or the lifting of any suspension and the reasons for such action. Unless lifted prior to the revocation hearing the suspension may remain in effect until the chief makes a final determination based upon the revocation hearing.
Any hazardous waste generation or handling for which a hazardous waste license has been suspended, shall be discontinued immediately and shall not be restarted until the suspension of the permit has been lifted or a new permit has been issued.
B.
This section shall not deprive the chief or the county of authority to pursue any other action or remedy otherwise available to them under the law.
