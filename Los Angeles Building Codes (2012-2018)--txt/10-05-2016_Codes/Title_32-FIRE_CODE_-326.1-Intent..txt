326.1 - Intent.
The unrestricted use of grass, grain, brush, or forest-covered land, in certain hazardous fire portions of the jurisdictional area due to conditions tending to cause or allow the rapid spread of fires which may occur on such lands, or because of the inaccessible character of such lands, is a potential menace to life and property from fire. Therefore, it is the intent of this section to provide necessary safeguards to prevent the occurrence of fires and to control the spread of fires which might be caused by recreational, commercial, industrial, or other activities carried on in any hazardous fire area.
