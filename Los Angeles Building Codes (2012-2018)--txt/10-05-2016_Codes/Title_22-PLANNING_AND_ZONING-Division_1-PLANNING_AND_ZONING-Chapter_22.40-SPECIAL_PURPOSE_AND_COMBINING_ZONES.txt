Part 2 - ( )-DP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ZONE
Sections:

22.40.030 - Establishment—Purpose.
Zone ( )-DP is established to provide a zone in which development occurring after property has been rezoned will conform to plans and exhibits submitted by the applicant in instances where such plans and exhibits constitute a critical factor in the decision to rezone. Adherence to such developmental plans is assured by the requirement of submission and approval of a conditional use permit incorporating a development program by the applicant providing necessary safeguards to insure completion as specified.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 2 Art. 6 § 291.1, 1927.)
22.40.040 - Permitted uses.
If a conditional use permit has been obtained as provided in Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, property in Zone ( )-DP may be used for any use permitted in the basic zone subject to the conditions and limitations of the conditional use permit, including the approved development program which shall be contained therein.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 2 Art. 6 § 291.2, 1927.)

A.
A plot plan showing the location of all proposed structures, the alteration or demolition of any existing structures, and development features, including grading, yards, walls, walks, landscaping, height, bulk and arrangement of buildings and structures, signs, the color and appearance of buildings and structures, and other features as may be needed to make the development attractive, adequately buffered from adjacent more restrictive uses, and in keeping with the character of the surrounding area;
B.
A progress schedule, which shall include all phases of development and indicate the sequence and time period within which the improvements described will be made.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 2 Art. 6 § 291.3, 1927.)
22.40.060 - Development program—Criteria for consideration.
In addition to other requirements of Part 1 of Chapter 22.56, the hearing officer shall consider the development program submitted, and in approving a conditional use permit shall find that such development program provides necessary safeguards to insure completion of the proposed development by the applicant forestalling substitution of a lesser type of development contrary to the public convenience, welfare or development needs of the area.
(Ord. 85-0195 § 9 (part), 1985; Ord. 1494 Ch. 2 Art. 6 § 291.4, 1927.)
22.40.070 - Development program—Permit conditions.
A.
All of the following conditions shall be deemed to be conditions of every development program in an approved conditional use permit, whether such conditions are set forth in the conditional use permit or not. Except as otherwise specified as part of said development program:
1.
No building or structure of any kind except a temporary structure used only in the developing of the property according to the program shall be built, erected, or moved onto any part of the property.
2.
No existing building or structure which under the program is to be demolished shall be used.
3.
No existing building or structure which, under the program, is to be altered shall be used until such building or structure has been so altered.
4.
All improvements shall be completed prior to the occupancy of any structures.
5.
Where one or more buildings in the projected development are designated as primary buildings, building permits for structures other than those so designated shall not be issued until the foundations have been constructed for such primary building or buildings.
B.
Where specifically so indicated in approval of the development program, such schedule may permit development to be completed in phases. In interpreting the provisions of subdivisions 4 and 5 of subsection A above, each such separately designated phase shall be considered a separate development program.
(Ord. 1494 Ch. 2 Art. 6 § 291.5, 1927.)
22.40.080 - Review of zone classification.
A.
Upon expiration of an unused conditional use permit in Zone ( )-DP, or if no application for a conditional use permit has been filed within two years following the effective date of an ordinance placing property in Zone ( )-DP, the Commission may investigate the circumstances resulting in failure to apply for or use such conditional use permit.
B.
In all cases the Commission may extend such time for a period of not to exceed one year, provided an application requesting such extension is filed prior to such expiration date.
C.
If neither the applicant, nor the person who on the latest available assessment roll appears to be the owner of the property involved, substantiates to the Commission's satisfaction that additional time should be granted for the filing of an application for, or reapplication for, a conditional use permit, the Commission may institute proceedings to rezone such property to the zone in existence prior to the adoption of Zone ( )-DP or to such other zone as may be deemed appropriate.
D.
If upon the expiration of additional time granted by the Commission no application has been filed for a conditional use permit, or if a second conditional use permit has expired unused, the Commission may initiate proceedings to rezone such property as provided in this section.
